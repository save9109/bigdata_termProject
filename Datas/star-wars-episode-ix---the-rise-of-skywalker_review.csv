0,this movie is the final nail in the coffin... dont waste your money on this crap. its rushed... they try to fix all the holes that the previous crappy episodes left behind amd it fails completly.,0
1,"A final cluster train wreck mess in a sequel that had no  plans or even an outline from the start and wow it shows in this mess.  This movie has no impact, internal logic, rules or consequences. Force healing and force expenditure death is stupid. BB8 gets smashed by Reys training - oh wait.. no he's fine.  Chewy dies because of Rey.. in a force pull fight with Kylo.. oh wait, no he doesn't.. he's fine..... Kylo dies..or should be dead when Rey cuts his ship (why didn't he shoot her) and he crashes and explodes in what would have kiled anyone. Nope. Just a flesh wound. Rey kills him in a light saber fight.. right through the guts..... oh wait no.. sorry about that.. that light saber through your guts... ummm... nah lemme fix that... alive again! Thrown off a cliff into an bottomless pit to die by the emperor.. no you're not... climb back up. Kylo dies and is back about 5 times in this dumb movie.Rey fully dies as well after she kills Palprocks with... the letter X!!! A mountain falls on her and fully kills her, she's dead.. they focus on her dead face she isn't frozen mary poppins she's dead...  oh wait... no she's not.. Kylo heals her... oh but now he's really dead. What? WTF is going on with rules in this stupid movie? Why didn't Rey fade away when she died if shes the most super duper powerful Jedi of all time? If Kylo turned good, why didn't he turn into a force ghost? Force ghosts can move objects so why don't they just fight.  Nothing follows any logic in this movie. Dumb dumb dumb dumb.  It looks pretty though.  Also easy to see Disney is out in force on Rotten Tomatoes with the bot army of one line 5 star reviews that say things like, ""A great and satisfying adventure!"" really? You give a movie 5 stars, take the time to get your dumb fandango ticket verified and that's what you write?",0
3,"Ok, I watched Star Wars: The rise of Skywalker. Ok, better forget I watched this and the last two movies of my beloved franchise.",0
4,"The Movie is not a worthy ending for the Skywalker Saga! The plottwist are terrible, Rey is a palpetine... **** it is about the Skywalkers and not a MaREY Sue who decides to be a Skywalker ... it‘s not a name you can take so easily... they kill all skywalkers for nothing, the original triology and the sequel one are useless if this movie is canon. It‘s disgusting and a shame for all Star Wars fans who are there since 1977... the effects were amazing, the fights were also okay, but the movie destroyed the other movies, Vader‘s Sacrifice was all for nothing, Rey is the Chosen-one which doesn‘t make any sense... The worst Star Wars Movie ever... I‘m depressed by the movie and don‘t want to see any Star Wars Content",0
5,"Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. The use of Shakespeare here couldn't be more apropos. This movie is a convoluted mess, and it's clear sunk cost fallacy is in full effect for like half the users here reviewing this tripe. Spare your wallet and give this a hard pass. You don't have to keep thinking you need to see the end of this **** to feel satisfied.",0
6,"Pretty much the saving grace of this was the effects, cinematography, the actors (John Boyega,Adam Driver and Ian Mcdiarmid) and the legendary John Williams.It's really not saying much but it is indeed better than the Last Jedi. However it all counts for naught as this films completely suffers from a very rushed story, pointless new characters and plot holes that have a negative impact on the movie itself and the whole franchise, lack of character development and charm the OT and even some of the prequels.The forced MCU comedy and a total lack of danger which what makes an adventure film thrilling and fun since all the characters are basically unstoppable,lack of consequences and numerous of conveniences for the characters.The trio, Rey Finn and Poe, we've seen them all together for the first time and all they do is argue and bicker each other all the time there's no chemistry there and I'm not convinced they're friends. What hurts the movie most of all is the cruelest joke of all; the return of Emperor Palpatine, which is an obvious last minute plan that adds more questions and really makes the previous trilogies pointless and ruins the beautifully ending of ROTJ. Was the the whole point of The Emperor's return without any indication from the previous films so he can be killed again in the lamest way possible????Why not bring back Snoke(Darth Maul survived), or have Jar Jar Binks be the final villain instead of bringing back a character long been established by the creator to be dead? Since he survived being completely obliterated in ROTJ along with Death Star II, how are you gonna convince me that's he's truly dead?The second biggest mistake was ironically what fans hated...ROS tries it's best to ignore the TLJ but it ends giving this trilogy more continuity issues than it already did. How can you watch the sequel films again when they all feel disconnected. Very lazily done by JJ Abrams. The plot twist was cheap, predictable and unoriginal. Rey is still a Mary Sue although she finally has some training(but too little too late, she's already perfect to begin with) by someone who is confirmed to not even be a Jedi master(facepalm). The cameos from the OT and fan service moments were too much and did not serve the plot as a whole. The whole plot was messy and rushed. It was then obvious that Disney wanted to create another Endgame for a great franchise which already ended decades ago.Also, how is this film PG-13? This whole trilogy was a retconed mess,that tarnishes the legacy of the OT and it damages the entire lore. It's best to pretend they never happened, but even better if they were wiped from canon.Legends EU Forever.",0
7,Utter garbage. Pointless pandering to a an aged fan base and a non existent one. Yet this is the best Disney can do. Now that this trilogy is over and you see what Disney has done to the frachise (turned it into a children's movie franchise)lets stop giving the #EvilestCorporationOnEarth money.,0
8,"This trilogy is an absolute joke. They never had a clear vision from the beginning and it shows. Even episode 7 vs episode 9 it feels like JJ had completely different ideas about how to end this than how he started. The story is a mess, the characters drone on with hopeless exposition, and there's not even much to be had for spectical for those looking for a fun pop corn movie. We've gone from a clone of  A New Hope, to a movie that called any critic a racist or sexist, to a movie now that drives a dagger so deep into the heart of SW that it's finally dead. I feel nothing.I was the biggest SW fan. I bought all the merch, I was apart of the 501st, heck it's even how I met my wife. This franchise all gone now. There's literally nothing left. Picture a film that could literally kill a 4 billion dollar franchise, and this is it. JJ, KK, Rian Johnson and Bob I. killed Star Wars. KK literally lied to Lucas' face, straight up, and said she'd care for his characters and his legacy. She's the one common thread between all three movies. She needs to be fired.Don't see it. Spare yourself. Go watch the other trilogies if you want to see some SW action. This is just too painful to watch.",0
9,"Lackluster, uninspired and rushed. That movie is a convoluted mess that believe so little in its own scenario it feels at time genuinely embarrassing to watch. A sad finish for a beloved saga that deserved so much better...",0
10,"I honestly didn't expect anything from this movie after The Last Jedi – there was simply no way to really write the saga out of that corner with just one movie. However, I was still disappointed: while episode 8 was infuriating with its nonsensical plot twists and disrespect for its place in the new trilogy, this one was simply baffling: atrociously paced and stupid beyond belief. The number of narrative shortcuts and dumb plot points simply made me laugh bitterly, while decent character development for Ray, the first in the whole trilogy, felt mute in the wake of awful writing and J. J. Abrams' obsession with  scale. The director shows Machel Bay-levels of equating large, loud events with epicness without understanding what makes such moments compelling. In the end, little in the film really has the emotional impact, or even dumb enjoyment factor it was aiming for.There's also something more to it: as I expected this to be a bad movie and wasn't really moved by that, I'm incredibly sad about what it did with the Star Wars canon, already shaken by the Episodes 7 and 8. The force is treated in a completely careless way, being able to do whatever is convenient for the plot. The main intrigue makes everything that happened in the earlier movies pointless and kind of stupid. It's just a sad, sad ending to the mainline Star Wars and an awful point for any kind of continuation. People might've disliked the prequels as movies, but they built upon the Star Wars universe and made space for some really fun spin-offs. They disappointed, but ultimately kept the franchise fresh. This honestly killed much if my enthusiasm for Star Wars as a whole and it's heartbreaking. I give it a 3 as a movie experience, as it had a few meaningful moments and didn't irritate me as much as The Last Jedi, but as a Star Wars fan I could just as well give it a 1 for finishing the tragedy of Disney trilogy in an even worse way than it had to.",0
12,"There was no big Fighting scene as I hoped to see. The Emperor died too easy and in my opinion his death unepic. Kylo and Rey did Kiss each other which made no sense, because the hate each other. Keylo was the reason thousands were killed and he killed his father, but that was forgotten by Rey.But even if the Story is bad, You should appreciate the work put into the CGI and the cast.",0
13,"There is a lot here that violates the rules of the universe established in prior films. Although I consider it more mannered toward the original cast, it’s on par if not worse than TLJ.",0
14,"Just a sloppy, lazy cash grab that spent the entire budget on special effects and marketing instead of on screenwriting and editing.  Kathleen Kennedy should be held responsible for destroying any hope of a good movie!",0
15,"While having the look, sound, feel and the obvious production values of previous Star Wars movies, TRoS fails badly in terms of plot, imagination, pacing, characterisation and satisfaction. It's a hollow and uninspired Star Wars movie.I'd love to start with the positives but unfortunately the bad stuff tanks this movie so badly it's where you must start because it's so shocking where Star Wars has ended up. TRoS feels in different ways worse than Solo. I have to start with the plot, it's unimaginative and empty. You get thrust into the middle of things already happening and only have the opening crawl to know slightly what's going on. Then everything in from there happens at hyperdrive speeds. You just get exposition thrown at you and vague reasons for why our heroes have to go somewhere. Questions about the mission and how did stuff happen are just bluntly explained away with a sentence from someone. There is no mystery or clever thinking it's just go there and stumble across the answer. The film allows you no time to get to know a place or a character. The pacing is rushed and if you don't listen to every quick conversation you will miss something. Fortunately the plot is so basic like a World of Warcraft fetch quest that if you do miss a line it doesn't matter. It's a McGuffin hunt directing Rey to we all know what because the trailers have already spoiled it and the opening crawl spells it out. The camaraderie between our heroes is lousy, they just bicker and the tiny bit of wit they do show is eye rolling bad. The dialogue is basic and does the job but no effective wit and humour. I only chuckled at one line C3PO said and somethings Babu Frik said and did. Nothing else amused me even Chewy or D-O didn't add any humour. Rey is who you spend easily 95% of the movie with either on her own or with someone and unfortunately Daisy Ridley just doesn't act the part very well. She isn't very expressive and is one dimensional. Her performance isn't truely believable, her anger doesn't come over and her happy side is just a grin. Many scenes shes in shock or bewilderment and in them she just looks like a rabbit in the headlights. Oscar Isaacs is good if predictable and John Boyega's performance is the best out of the main stars but nothing special. The new characters are awfully implemented they just appear and you just have to go along with it and not expect a proper introduction to them. I truthfully can't remember their names. They come into the story so abruptly and then they go away and show up barely at the end. Don't know why they bothered putting them in, they're just in there as a means to an end I guess and just products of bad writing. The film squeezes in so much exposition and McGuffin hunts into the 2 hrs 20, the movie doesn't have space for character development. The Knights of Ren have about 2 minutes of screen time, no joke ! Some characters also make illogical decisions throughout and their motivation for why they suddenly decide to do something isn't well conveyed over to the audience, you just have to go along with it and not question why. I guess it keeps the pace up not deeply getting into the why, they just do. I prefer being involved in characters thought processes. The First Order scenes are just cheesy and bad, I just didn't feel any threat from them and they felt like pantomine villains. Hux and Pryde are crinchy and lame.The lightsaber battles were fun if a little short and predictable. The fighting scenes became ridiculous though with the use of 3 different never before seen force powers which made the final battle and aftermath laughable. Now for the good...The visual presentation on show is impressive. The locations and sets look great with amazing vibrancy and detail, everything is spot on, it looks Star Wars. The CGI is solid as all the ships, speeders and structures are well rendered although some of the graphics in outside scenes like on the desert planet look fake. The special visual effects are top notch every blaster flash and explosion. They thankfully haven't tinkered with the library of Skywalker Sound assets so every lightsaber zoom and TIE fighter screech are exact. The music is the best part of the film, it's the original trilogy John Williams themes which have been lifted and polished to perfection. The nostalgia is what Abrams nails and he knows how to milk it through sound and visuals. There are lots of new aliens which look great and are all done using animatronics. The space battles are good and decent but you don't get much more than 10 second flashes of dogfighting before it cuts to something else. The ship battles and saber battles are exciting but before you can really get into them they're over.There were some good performances from Ian McDiarmid, Adam Driver, Billy Dee Williams and Mark Hamill. The Leia scenes are cleverly implemented with old Carrie Fisher footage.A disappointing end to the saga.",0
16,"JJs attempt to please everyone, ends up satisfying very few. Overuse of nostalgia in a movie that didn't need it. He answers some of his mystery boxes from TFA, but then drops some new ones that will never be answered. It's a film that undermines TFA, TLJ, and itself. Sometimes from scene to scene, and sometimes in the same scene! Go see it if you want to see how the Saga ""ends"", but there is very little substance and I'm sure you'll forget about it once you're in the parking lot.",0
17,"I went to see the movie today, and I hoped it was going to end the Saga with a bang, but I was mistaken... it was a Frankenstein, characters didn't make sense, way to much fan service, the movie was a remake of episode 6, cinematography was good, but the plot didn't make sense, I will not be re-watching this movie ever again, can't remember the music and the actors lacked enthusiasm.",0
18,Like watching a three hour long trailer. No time for contemplation or character depth here!,0
19,"I have never seen a franchise completely destroy a character as thoroughly as Disney did to Luke. The story was convoluted with multiple mcguffins and random contrivances just to keep the story going, while explaining nothing and ignoring previously established cannon. Rey solidified herself as a Mary Sue by doing what all the other jedi before her couldn't, and do it with no training, difficultly, or hardship. This movie was soulless.",0
20,"Disaster, what is there else to say?I facepalmed during the whole movie. Another insult to the saga, hopefully the last one for good.",0
21,"Probably the worst Star Wars movie ever made: full of holes in the plot and with a final scene that makes useless the existence of the previous 8 movies. The Rise of Skywalker....Anakin should be on the center of the scene with Rey and Palpatine....not just as voice! This movie destroyed the Star Wars canon, substituting it with something that has no logic sense!",0
22,"Incredibly bad written.  It feels like a clumsy collage of old star wars facts thrown over the new story that seemed to have potential to be beautiful and meaningful, arranged in a way that makes no sense whatsoever.",0
23,"I wasn't going to bother with a review, but after seeing literally dozens of user reviews on several websites, all that seem to say the exact same thing of how ""satisfying"" this film was: It's clear to me that there's some kind of mass paid shilling going on. I didn't think this sort of thing actually happened until just now.The characters all suffer the same flaws as the previous two mainline entries.The story seems forced and doesn't make sense so much of the time.The writing and background is terrible, seemingly being used as an excuse to thrust fanservice or flashy/""impressive"" moments on the audience without reason.And once again, they completely butcher the nature of The Force as an excuse to advance completely irrelevant and poorly written plot points, or ""character development"".The only things that are positive about this film were it's visuals, and some action sequences. Both things everyone should expect from a film with this subject matter and studio budget. So that's where they get the 2 points from.I simply can't recommend this to anyone who isn't a young child or quite drunk.",0
24,"Oh dear, the skywalker saga ends with a wet fart, heads must roll at the top.",0
25,Kind of reminded me of the Community episode where Abed has like six seconds of footage of a film starring Chang and the school tries to turn the thing into a feature-length movie. The visual effects were really nice though.,0
26,"The Disney trilogy is a mess! They wanted to turn the attention away from the old Star Wars to a new one with new characters that would be what the Disney flagship wanted but it all ended horribly. It just doesn't feel like the new characters are friends even. It's a plastic repackaging that tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing no-one. This was supposed to be the ""Star Wars Endgame"" but it felt more like a new stand-alone movie rather than the ending of a trilogy. I can't help but wondering how the trilogy would have been if they just had used the scripts that George Lucas provided. Really disappointed in this one",0
27,"So palpatine survived being thrown down the shaft and exploded, and then the entire death star exploding, and somehow escape the void of space and then clone/test tube births snoke to make the first order army so they can then join the sith army he already has. All in service to have his granddaughter kill him so he can transfer his essence into her?The is the most convoluted contrived plot I've ever heard of and reeks of bottom of the barrel panic writing to patch up what TLJ clearly destroyed. I mean, Disneys own lore building comics have snoke state he's old enough to have seen the empire rise and fall, but was cloned after the fall? Clearly this entire trilogy is broken and beyond repair",0
28,"The movie completely ignores all the Star Wars Lore, completely ruins what was achieved by the 6 Episodes that came before it and adds nothing new to the Star Wars universe. They expect you to believe everything that is thrown at you in quick succession without explaining anything. Even as a standalone movie it's mediocre at best because of a badly written plot and horrible pacing. At least the visuals, music, and acting were really good.",0
29,"Not only is the worst star wars movie but its also one of the worst movie ever made... The movie is flat, there are no emotion and the plot had no sense and destroy everything That Lucas created in the first six movie and everything that they were tying to create whit episode 7 and 8... How to destroy a saga... Well done Disney",0
30,"This film is an absolute disaster. The pacing is an absolute mess, with hard, what feels like almost smash cuts between scenes at times. The editing is super jarring. That's before we even get to the plot. It's about two movies worth of plot, smashed into one. Every scene is rushed, it moves at a thousand miles an hour, and not only dialled up to eleven, but maybe fifteen. There are literally thousands (maybe even tens of thousands) of new Sith Star Destroyers, each with a planet destroying laser, which is also the achilles heel of the entire design. Also they decided to build all these ships on a planet which left them entirely vulnerable to a surprise attack, where the ships can't leave without being guided, or use their shields. So they built ships with a massively exploitable flaw, on a planet where they can't use shields or leave without being guided away by a command ship. I'm sure this is just because they are arrogant or something. Tactical genius.I've not even really got into the super bad bits. Leia is retconned to being a Jedi, because someone needs to train Rey now. Even though Luke can now affect the world as a force ghost, given he lifts a sunken X-Wing from the sea, and catches a Lightsaber. I imagine it'd be pretty useful to be a totally impervious force ghost Jedi. So we've got one pretty serious retcon, and then a canon issue (though we can thank Rian for establishing that one).Then we have force healing (and actually, force resurrection). Ben resurrects Rey, using his life force. I vaguely remember in Episode III that the ability to bring people back to life was regarded as a Sith power. But Ben uses it anyway, and the force ghosts his way out of there. We've got force healing now established at the very last stage of nine films, which now kinda makes Obi-Wan look a bit heartless watching his master die when apparently this is a common technique, or we're lead to believe the Jedi never bothered to train anyone this before now. I guess they were arrogant and assumed they'd never be hurt. I guess force not let people die wasn't seen as super important.Historically, the prequels and cartoons all set before the original trilogy have been able to add new abilities and powers. We have a lot of brand new abilities on show here that somehow weren't available to the countless generations of Jedis before. The license to create new abilities isn't really here, because it just raises questions about why these things weren't used before. Both the Jedi and the Sith are seriously limited in power. It's the end of a war.Palpatine force lightnings a fleet. What. The. Hell.Every Skywalker in this goes out like a chump. Luke did in TLJ. Leia manages to get her son shanked, then dying trying to communicate with him. Then Ben gives his life and flat lines. Skywalker legacy is gone. Literally completely dead. You can call a Palpatine a Skywalker if you want but it doesn't make it so. This is the total fall of Skywalker, not a rise. Luke says he's wrong about staying on the island, and he did so out of fear. Fear. I vaguely remember Yoda saying something about fear once. Luke exiles himself, on an island, when his force ghosty friends are around for potentially decades, out of fear. You know, the path to the dark side. Right-o.This is Star Wars by people who do not understand Star Wars.",0
31,"Good visuals, good work from the cast, some nice action scenes. That's the good. The bad is the story, the characters, and the ugly is the fanservice. This movie packed with more member berries than ever, and they're not even close to being subtle. Watch this if you feel like you wanted to see a bad remake of Return of the Jedi, otherwise you can skip it.",0
32,"Some cool action, but the story does not stay together. It reminds me of the horrible storytelling of the Transformers movies, and with cliché and plot holes like this, good visuals cant save it even for me. It does not make sense at all. I love awesome action and sci-fi, but not when it becomes a dumb mess like this.. And as a last part of a trilogy, without a plan from the start, this falls even more flat...I do now dream about what this trilogy could have been. For this is really disappointing.  Star Wars made in our time should be so much more. Rewievers and people that gives this 10/10 are payed to do so,  or does not have any demands at all what a Star Wars movie should be. Just write Star Wars in the title, cram it full of sad scenes, and it recieves top score. That is insane!",0
33,A convoluted mess that nullifies the redemption story of Anakin Skywalker. Not worth seeing again. Go see Cats instead.,0
34,"As a movie, it is really bad. Bad effects, bad pace, bad story and so on. As the end of the (Anakin) Skywalker saga, it is really bad. With no respect whatsoever for the two previous Trilogies and for the previous film too. I'm basically not a SW fan anymore. #notmychosenone",0
35,"As a life long star wars fan I can honestly say this movie was insulting to the legacy of star wars. Sound dramatic? The movie is that bad. It felt like I was watching a transformers movie. Loud, lazy, soulless.",0
36,No real plot. Everything that could be considered good about this movie was ripped off from the original 6 movies. Huge plot holes. The movie was crammed and rushed and was basically a scavenger hunt. The dialogue treated the audience as if we were 5 year olds. Very short lightsaber fight. The force abilities were so far fetched that it felt nothing like star wars. I had no emotional ties to any of the characters. In conclusion this movie made me feel as if Disney stripped the name off of star wars and placed it on their own strange low budget like sci fi film. Disgraceful.,0
37,"Я не знаю, как написать насколько фильм плох, не спойлеря. Это не фильм, это клип MTV - все дерганное, нет долгих сцен. Все сделано для чтобы зритель не успевал понять насколько бредово то что происходит. И нет, это не работает. Фильм - красивый набор идиотских ситуаций которые пытаются вызвать у зрителя ностальгию, но не могут.Меня радует только то что Дисней не получил мои деньги - я сидел в кинотеатре бесплатно.I do not know how to write how bad the film is, not a spoiler. This is not a movie, this is an MTV video - everything is twitching, there are no long scenes. Everything has been done so that the viewer does not have time to understand how miserably what is happening. And no, that doesn't work. The film is a beautiful set of idiotic situations that try to arouse nostalgia in the viewer, but they cannot.I am only happy that Disney did not receive my money - I sat in the cinema for free.",0
38,Further tramples in the original films by completely undoing Anakin's redemption and the whole purpose of Luke. Bringing the Emperor back alive was a terrible choice in an otherwise completely forgettable movie that had zero consequence for any sacrifices the characters made.At least it's over now.,0
39,"I really really hated this movie. Made no sense. Crammed in a bunch of cut EU story lines that made no sense in this trilogy. They were not set up, not fleshed out, and just not interesting.There was a decent amount of action, but none of it meant anything to me because I didn't care about the story or the characters.I spent the whole time just wishing it would end.",0
40,"Star Wars the Rise of Marey Sue is a convoluted mess of a movie. The whole plot is nonsensical as it's based on Palpatine that somehow survived the fall, explosion from the reactor and on top of that the annihilation of the second death star. Maybe the audience will get an explanation for this amazing feat? Nope. It's shoved away by the line from the prequels about unnatural powers of the dark side. He's just here for some weird fanservice and to die by the hand of a ""true hero"" - Rey in one of the most anticlimactic endings I've ever seen in the cinema that makes the story of episodes 1-6 null and void. To even, get to the ending the audience has to endure the never-ending fetch quests for objects of plot value. It's so bad that at some point the main crew of characters have to find a missing person that has an item that leads to another item that finally leads to the big bad. All of this is held by the endless rush of action and scenes that overwhelm you with visuals and callbacks because in today's day and age you need to be distracted to not see the floppy writing.The characters are as bland as in 7&8, but on top of that this time we spice things up with inconsistency. Rey's power level fluctuates depending on the plot. She had a year of training on top of the godly powers demonstrated in 7&8 so she should be pretty strong at this point right? Nope. She can't even beat Kylo which she defeated two times in previous movies, but somehow Leia has to die for her to beat him. Speaking of Kylo his power level changes as well, because somehow he can stand to the godly Rey now and even overwhelm her at one point. Consistency? What's this? Rey also pulls new abilities out of nowhere because she's that good I guess. Also, Kylo's story arc is this movie is that - he's super evil, then he's not evil because a phantom of Han Solo told him to be good and then he sacrifices himself for Rey by kissing her lips and transferring his life force to her so she can claim that she's Skywalker on the Tatooine. It's bad.Finn exists now solely to yell ""Rey"". The movie tries to develop and bond him with a new character and her band that are also ex-stormtroopers, but it never goes beyond surface-level as the pace of the story won't allow developing anyone. Not to mention this squad's whole backstory is ""we just gave up on killing civilians"" and First Order didn't do anything about them.Poe also received an additional backstory that is supposed to give him depth because he was a smuggler once and had a dubious girlfriend. It's only important to the story, so they can find another plot device and move on as fast as they can.As for other characters, many fakeout deaths try to evoke emotions in the audience. At one point Cheewie is killed by Rey using force lightning on First Order's transport ship by accident. In the very next scene, he is ok so there's no lesson for Rey and the audience feels cheated by baiting out a character's death. The same happens with C3PO that ""dies"" just to read a message on one plot device so the crew can find another plot device. He's later restored by R2D2 so any emotional impact of ""looking last time at my friends"" scene is null and void.At the end of the movie, I felt hollow. There was nothing, but empty fanservice and convoluted plot. I don't want a perfect story, but please J.J try to use basic logical consistency next time.",0
41,"Well...The end is here. And I’m happy to say that this is the WORST Star Wars film to date. ‘The Rise of Skywalker’ is treated like a movie made for the fans, but honestly, it’s the final middle finger to them. Granted, a lot of people may end up liking the movie because it retconned ‘The Last Jedi’, but I don’t see how this made anything better. This movie was treated like an average children’s movie rather than a Sci-Fi epic conclusion to a forty-two year running franchise beloved by millions. Conundrum on top of conundrum, cheesy dialogue/humor, unnecessary twists, needless callbacks, and plenty of cat-and-mouse type antics. The only good things in this film is the engaging action sequences, yet they are too quick for you to actually be on the edge of your seat for (referred to for the beginning of the film, until the final battle), and the visuals, which most are eye-catching. What a way to end Star Wars...Like the way you’d unexpectedly lose someone you care about. That’s how I feel about this. Like as if I lost someone very important in my life.",0
42,"A movie made without a plan and it shows. I had to push myself to sit through the entire movie. There was maybe a half dozen moments where I considered just walking out of the ""movie"".",0

44,"By far and away the worst of the saga. Terribly edited. Story is complete nonsense. It is a long, senseless McGuffin chase. Loads of broken canon. Looks like a rush job and now Abrams has destroyed Star Trek and now utterly destroyed Star Wars. This man has assaulted American mythology for what purpose? What did he gain by defacing our modern myths? Do not give your money to The Mouse or to Bad Reboot.",0

47,This movie is what happens when you try to appease everyone.. it just ends up pissing off most people.. the only people who actually like this movie are those who never had their hopes up or are new to this star wars saga... real shame because this saga had real potential.,0
48,"Completely disappointing. Stale humor, disrespect for lore, cheesy writing.",0
49,It's a disgusting plot. The timekeeping is stretched by meaningless scenes. Dialogues are disgustingly spelled out. I wanted to leave the theater after 5th minute.,0
50,"Worst SW movie ever made. SFX is the only part that is good, the rest (plot, characters development, etc) is trash",0
51,"Star wars rise of Skywalker is the biggest middle finger to fans , playing on emotions that you don’t feel during the movie and trying to make it like avengers Endgame . Total abomination  !",0
52,"This movie was largely incoherent from a story telling point of view. The main characters repeated the line, ""if this fails then it (meaning the whole saga) has been for nothing."" I think this clearly shows how obvious it was to the writers that they story was largely irrelevant and forced in relation to the previous 8 films.It seems to me Disney ran out of steam on this one. They weren't really the right people to make this final trilogy as their interest is in the wrong place.",0
53,"Is a real bad ending to the trilogy and worst for the whole saga, this last one is like you wanna answer questions, say sorry, make up wasted time in world building and above all rush an entire trilogy in a little more than 2 hours forgetting to make a good paced movie and ignoring all previous established in universe explanations for things, be prepared if you are going to see it.",0
54,Completely disregards pre-established lore so Rey can be the chosen one. Disney should be embarrassed for creating this trilogy with absolutely no plan in mind. Their failure is now complete.,0
55,Not goooood. :( Really sad because I loved both TFA and TLJ. This one just left me feeling empty inside. Like Donuts for Dinner.,0
56,Nothing that happens on the screen makes sense. Dialogues are a joke. Even the choreography of the fight looks terrible. The director treats audiences like morons. Each subsequent idea is more stupid than the previous one. Disappointment breaks the heart. This trilogy should be erased from memory.,0

58,"Genuinely shocked at the terrible pacing of this film.Forget the plot for a second. The film never gives you a second to think?! The characters do a thing, do another thing and blitz through the Galaxy to another thing in lightning quick succession and you feel limp watching it. The film doesn't breathe...at all?!As an audience member, going to the cinema is a passive experience, it's the director aim to make you feel something. You have no choice in this film but to just sit there, take it and try to keep up this ridiculous plot. How can an editor work on that and think they've done a good job is beyond me.Lightsaber fights are rubbish and have no meaning. The choreography is average, not worthy of the final chapter in the Stars Wars Saga.The space battles are crap, the worst of any Star Wars film to date. No dogfights, no sense of danger. When a resistance person does get killed you're really not bothered.Others will destroy this film for its narrative in depth. And it's all completely justified. It's a poorly thought out Trilogy of films that doesn't deserve the Star Wars title it has. But the pacing, this is appalling work by the editorial department and JJ.",0

Rey è nipote di Palpatine perché sì, lui è tornato perché sì, ha un esercito perché sì. Non torna niente, il film è una merda orripilante e brutta. Inguardabile e corrosivo per il cuore di ogni vero fan.",0
62,"I've seen deus ex machina's in a film before, but never before has an entire movie been one giant miracle Hail Mary divine intervention victory lap. It has more holes in it than a scalp after a hair transplant and more nostalgia bait and fan-pandering than all Pixar/DreamWorks/Disney sequels combined. If it wasn't for Daisy Ridley being hot, I'd give this what I gave 'Battlefield Earth'. I'd say a lot more, but it's one in the morning and I want to get at least six hours sleep. Abrams, if you want to spit on the grave of a beloved franchise, why don't you reboot 'Felicity' while you're at it.? It would actually be better than this.",0
63,"Absolutely horrendous. There are so many things that are still left unanswered AND new questions that we'll likely never get answers to. Here are some that are bothering me...How is Rey so powerful? Saying that she's a Palpatine is just lazy writing and I'll show why right now. Palpatine is dead, and should have remained dead. Bringing him back to life completely undermines the whole Skywalker story! Now all the work, all the suffering Luke and Anakin went through- it's all for nothing. Just so we can have Rey, the complete Mary Sue defeat Palpatine? Why? Rey gets almost no training and these little snippets of her training in TLJ and this movie aren't enough. They're not convincing. She's doing things with the force we've never seen before. Who did she learn them from? Leia? How did Leia learn them? From Luke? Yet we've never seen Luke heal anyone with the force, so that isn't convincing.Speaking of Luke- how did Maz find Anakin's/Luke's lightsaber? She said it was a ""story for another time"" in TFA, but we didn't get the story in TLJ or in this movie. Where did she get it? How? Why?Why is Hux the spy? The way he ousts himself as the spy is ridiculous. His motivations make no sense. He says he doesn't want the Resistance to win, but he doesn't want Kylo to win. That just shows he has no allegiance. The Resistance has no reason to protect him once he's served his purpose as Hux doesn't care for their cause, and Kylo wont care to take Hux back as Hux has betrayed him.Why is Rose completely sidelined in this movie? I don't like her character at all, but there's no satisfying conclusion between her and Finn. Instead it looks like Rose was replaced by this Jana chick, so we don't have to deal with the blunders made by Rian through the character of Rose. That's just lazy though.Why are Finn, Rey, and Poe always bickering? We're supposed to believe these are people who are good friends, yet they bicker like they just met each other or never bothered to smooth out any problems they've ever had with each other.I've got more questions, but I'll move on from that...for now.There's tons of fan service, but it's insulting. It's as if Disney thinks Star Wars fans are stupid. The kiss between Rey and Kylo seems stupid as they really don't look like a convincing couple. JJ's attempts to make you care about what's going on through Leia's, Luke's, Han's, and Lando's appearances fall flat. Why should I care? You've ruined and then killed him. You turned Han into some sort of deadbeat and then killed him too. Leia is apparently a full fledged Jedi, but Carrie Fisher's gone now, and yet you parade her around in this movie as terrible CGI, instead of giving her a respectful sendoff in TLJ. Oh and Lando? He's just here for nostalgia's sake. Of course, Palpatine is here for pretty much the same reason....nostalgia.Sure, the movie looks incredible, but I expect that from Disney. What I didn't expect, was that I'd feel so uninterested in the major battle near the end of the movie. This is supposed to be epic and I don't care. I don't care at all. I couldn't care less if Rey, Finn, Poe, Rose, Janna, etc die, because I know so little about them and worse, Rey and Rose aren't even likable. Now you've made it worse by having Rey be the chosen one, undermining the Skywalkers' story. You even have her take on the Skywalker name, which is disgusting as it doesn't feel earned at ALL. Good job, Disney. Your main character, the one we should all love as much as we love Luke, is liked about as much as Jar Jar Binks. Fantastic.It's funny...I decided to watch this movie because I'd heard about all the leaks and thought I'd at least get a good laugh out of this train-wreck. Instead, I was bored, annoyed, and by the end, disgusted. Even with all the leaks, watching all of this unfold was still simply appalling. To make matters worse, it's clear Disney is doing HUGE amounts of damage control. I've seen so many 10/10 reviews that say the same thing, in the same words, and with the same sentence structure. If this movie is a 10/10 to so many people, why aren't they going into great detail about it? Instead I see a few 7 and 8s giving some details and lots of negative reviews detailing just how much they hate the movie, and more importantly, WHY they hate the movie.This movie is absolutely horrendous and even worse than The Last Jedi. It's NOT a ""satisfying end to the trilogy"" and no amount of fake reviews is going to change that. It really is the worst Star Wars movie ever. Skip this one and watch the Mandalorian instead. At least that's actually decent.1/10. (Updated Dec, 22, 2020) Ok, so I'm going to add more stuff..Zorii Bliss is a weak character. Her motivations changed from being angry at Poe for leaving her behind on Kijimi to wanting to help him, Rey, and Finn so quickly that it'd make your head spin.How did Lando get all those Resistance ships on his side in so little time?!Still a 1/10.",0
64,"Somehow it turned out worse than The Last Jedi which I didn't think was possible. It's pointless rehash of original trilogy designed to target your nostalgia and prolong a story that concluded 3 movies ago written by people who didn't give a single crap about the franchise. No character arcs, no decent story, just a bunch of nice CGI slapped around a ton of irrelevant scenes that break the lore and play out pretty much as you'd expect. Why do the same characters keep coming back in an entire galaxy filled with hundreds of races and billions of characters? If this was fan fiction, people would despise it but Disney wanted a paycheck so here we are.",0
65,"To be honest, if you look at it as a blockbuster as any others, it is decent (it would deserve a 5-6). The movie is beautiful with some nice pictures, there are a lot of events, too much for me, you don t have the time to be bored. So if you are not a huge fan of Star Wars and if you quite enjoyed the last two movies, you will like this one.But now, I consider mysel as an hardcore fan: I love the first 6 films, and for me the original trilogy and the prelogy are on an equal footing. I didn't like episode VII and even if I don't agree with many things in the VIII, TLJ has taken some risks (like the episodes I - II - III). But this episode IX is by far the worst star wars movie ever.There are many reasons to that:   - The Force is used in new ways that turn Luke, Anakin or Obi-Wan like padawans. The saddest thing is that they could use it to make something impressive, like an amazing lightsaber fight like in the III. But no, it is only to simplify the movie and to make it go faster.   - Talking about lightsaber fights, there are neither interesting nor impressive at all.   - Personnally, I didn't enter in the story: they are just looking for items to unlock another item to reach some place. Wouah!   - The characters are still bad, even if Poe is better depicted in this one. I was quite impressed on how they add Leia in the movie, even if it feels forced, it was ok for me. New characters are totally useless.   - The music is ok at least but there is no new theme that stroke me.   - Most of the question are answered but the issue is that new ones arrived with the revelations. And the answers detroys litterally everything in the story of Star Wars.  In the end, I felt like I saw a fan film where Disney put many ideas to please the fans.But this is not the way to do it: I wanted something brand new. Episode VIII is the only one which can could be qualified as a new star wars movie in this trilogy.  If you liked it, good for you. I will try with the time to appreciate it but it was so painfull for me to watch this movie. I hope that the next ones will be better...",0
66,"This is an empty clunky movie. It never even comes close to capturing the magic of the originals. There is no vision for the film, and what's worse the action is not even impressive. Skip at all costs.",0
67,"Disney has ruined this trilogy and with this film they have hurt the legacy of all the previous George Lucas films, a pandering fan fiction that tries to make you feel something using all the other movies as the basis. Makes me wish i was watching them or the clone wars animated show",0
68,"The best I can put it is small moments of brilliance, packed in a cocoon of cluster-f@#kery.As expected the visual, sound and music is what really keeps it up with the added nostalgia factor.The story is a rushed mess.It actually feels like they took everything they found on the internet, and threw it at the script. What didn't fall off of it made it in to the movie.In terms of characters, they mostly fall flat. Adam Driver did probably most of the work here ... which isn't saying much considering that he played a very two dimensional character.Logic is almost none existent at this point. I know people come to its defense saying that its a fiction, but with the thing is that even fiction needs to have rules and logic that makes sense in its own world, in order for it to work. Otherwise there is nothing keeping it from becoming chaotic. Most of what I saw today was an afterthought, considering how fast it goes trough story beats, and tries desperately to do damage control after TLJ.",0
69,"Awful movie. Mary Sue theory is confirmed. Anakin/ Vader ‘s story arc and Luke’s arc are simply thrown away as garbage. Other characters are simply dispensable, specially Kylo and Finn. Completely useless. There is no connection with the audience. Palpatine is brought again but only to serve as a explanation for the unexplainable. Bottom line: this movie is a epitaph that represents all the lack of respect and huge greedy from Disney in handle this franchise. It´s the worst movie of the whole saga, until now... How worse they an get?",0
70,"Rushed, convoluted, retcon filled nonsense that disrespects the actual good star wars movies. The crawl alone could have been its own movie. There's no intrigue or setup to Palpatines return, he is just thrown in immediately, nothing is explained, he is just there next to his jar of pickled Snokes. Never mind the fact that him being alive completely negates Anakin's sacrifice and the journey undertaken in the first 6 movies. The characters are bland and boring, Rey is so overpowered its a joke and the new force powers break everything. Finn just runs around shouting REEEEYYY non stop. C3PO, Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca are the only standouts, R2D2 is relegated again to promote new merchandise droids. There is so much nonsense it would take ages to discuss... who was Palps banging??? How are all these ships out here in the middle of nowhere???? The end is hilariously bad, twilight mixed with divergent. And ends with nobody squatting in the name of the actual heroes of the previous movies. No wonder George Lucas didn't go to the premiere...",0
71,What a giant nonsensical mess.  I couldn't believe how rushed and pathetic the movie felt.  The sooner this entire trilogy is forgotten the better.  It makes Attack of the Clones look like Citizen Kane.,0

73,What a mess of a film. I dont think I can stomach writing about it. The 1 stars are for the aesthetic appeal and some of the jokes. That was SO BAD.JJ Abrams has created something unique all right - the first ever SW film without a heart.,0
74,"Finally, an ending to this god awful ""trilogy"" from JarJar Abrams and the woke AF SJWs.  What they did to our beloved heroes growing up is atrocious.  This movie wasn't even worth watching, but I ""had to know how it ended""...and thank goodness it's all over with.  In summary, do NOT bother paying money to watch this.  Disney should NOT be rewarded for the atrocities they have committed.",0
75,It's a shame the saga ended up like this. I wish this wasn't a canon. Welp.,0
76,"Pro:+music+same CGICons:-story plot of the movie is boring-body,items teleportation-Mary Sue-the chosen one-Palpatine somehow survived the fall, explosion from the reactor destroy -flat characters-space my little pony-ignore  star wars lore -broke and ignore true cannon and expanded universe Mara,Vongs,Solo kids,...-biggest middle finger to fans -The returns Palpatine, Wedge and Lando cant save the Disney thrash universe they have made. The story is absolutely bad. Its not bad the like the terrifying last Jedi, but bad. Sad as Disney destroyed the universe I loved for 30 years for what?for money.",0
77,"Having read some of the positive reviews it becomes clear that many of them are just paid or fake reviews as this movie cannot be rated with anything more than 5 by anyone who has a brain. Plotholes, McGuffins,lousy editing and weak CGI show this movie was put together more than once or twice with no clear plan in mind. It is shallow, uninspired, badly written and very disappointing. Sad to see Star Wars sink so low.",0
78,"I've never disliked a single Star Wars movie in my life prior to this moment... The originals, the prequels, the Force Awakens and even The Last Jedi, all have a special place in my heart. That is also supplemented by the vast amount of extra material I have read/watched/played through regarding the Star Wars universe. I went to the premiere of the Grand Finale of the Star Wars saga hoping that it would end our beloved story on a high note and would finally unite the fandom of Star Wars. Well, one must be careful with what they wish for. I felt nothing but apathy and cringe while watching that movie. The plot looked like a fan fiction written by kid who has maybe seen the OT movies once. For the movie that was supposed to summarize the entire saga, it might as well forget that the prequels ever existed in SW canon in the first place. Rushed, extremely fast paced, with deeply flawed logic, unopened ""mystery boxes"" and tons of cheap fan-service, this movie tries to deliver on all fronts and fails to do that miserably. JJ Abrams tried to undo the changes made by the previous film only to cause even more damage and make the entire trilogy a meaningless mess. This might very well be the only SW movie I'm never going to see again. From the positives: the actors did their best with what they had, the music was nice and the visuals are stunning.",0
79,"Oh, for god's sake. Palpatine had a granddaughter and it's rey. The original trilogy was for nothing. Why revive Palpatine? Why kill the main villain, Snoke in the second movie?",0
80,This movie broke cannon. The plot was rushed and just was worse than The Last Jedi.,0
81,"A horrible mess of a film, completely devoid of any original ideas and so desperate to retcon everything that the movie plays like a checklist made from a fan’s reddit post than an actual film. Not a single moment is given space or time to breathe, the film is so single-mindedly focused on hitting it’s plot beats that the characters become basically action figures. Motivations are abandoned and every character seems to just become a slave to the whims of a man who is so out of his depth. The film is so goddamn boring",0
82,"Even though i am a fanboy, this movie was unacceptable. Full of plot holes, and no explaining whatsoever.In all the scenes were happening things that only one in a million could have happened and happened every damn time. Pointless and without debth. Adding the fact that the directors took episode IX like never happened and continue somewhere else",0
83,"This movie is all action and no substance.  People that expected answers to questions raised in the first two movies get a single line of exposition as JJ proves he once again cannot come up with a moral, ethical, or logical conclusion to anything.  He also provies that he once again lied about not retconning aspects of The Last Jedi, becuase that is exactly what he does in Rise of Skywalker while further degrading the characters that Rian already debased.  JJ's typical mystery box McGuffin chases are just busy-work to distract from the lack of real script or character development.  Even the CGI fails at times, and Carrie Fisher's posthumous return to the screen is carried out very badly, feeling quite artifical and out of place.  If there was ever a single line of exposition pretending to be an explanation, Leiah suddenly being considered dead between movies would have be the time for it.  Heck, starting off with her funeral would have given the movie some much-needed feeling.  The ending is laughable and soul-sucking for any Star Wars fans, as it shatters the sacrifice of the original series and makes consequences meaningless in Disney Star Wars.",0
84,"Does J.J.Abrams hate Rian Johnson? Because this movie sure feels like it. One may or may not like the previous movie. But trying (with force) to turn around everything the previous episode built up makes me cringe. The visuals are stunning as usual and the acting is fine as well, there are even some elements of the plot which are ok. But overall it is a big disappointment. Like all Abrams movies it feels like tons of fan service crammed into a short as possible time. The plot of the movie is boring. Basically again the same plot as previous movies. Nothing new or interesting happens. All plot twists are expected. The whole palpatine story is just pure cringe.",0
85,"The trilogy truly ended in episode 8. JJ has nothing to work with but dug the hole deeper lol this movie has its awesome scenes but just no story arc. Reys character is a Mary Sue, some people can’t accept that. The Anakin chosen one was for nothing. Disney really **** up and there **** will never be canon to me. These new movies will please the new gen of fans which they don’t know **** about Star Wars but it deeply it hurts real fans for such a **** show of a mess this turned out to be.",0
86,"Unused  or uninteresting Characters, Bad pase history, Nostalgia overdose, bad decisions, doesnt do any new, predictable. Boring.",0
87,"It's not a terrible movie, but in terms of plot, it feels rushed and unrefined. It has two themes crashing and felt more like a war between Rian and JJ's two versions trying to make sense and come together. The use of Palpatine was not necessary and the way they utilized him was not well done. In terms of CGI, it's absolutely beautiful especially compared to recent movies. If you choose to go see it (which you should) don't expect a well put together film. However, it is the end of the skywalker saga and if you're a fan you wont walk away completely disappointed, but it is probably the worst star wars movie ever made.",0
88,"After TLJ, I was absolutely, positively convinced it couldn't get any worse. That train wreck of a black plot hole seemed unsurpassable in its abject stupidity, but alas, it obviously is, because now we have to deal with RoS.You see, I'm not a rabid SW fan. The OT has its fair share of problems, I really, really, really didn't like the prequels, and I was actually happy that the IP went to Disney and away from George (who's anything but the messiah of filmmaking he likes to think he is), and hey, I actually quite liked TFA overall, despite its problems. But TLJ burned the house down, and RoS actually manages to dump the charred remains into a vat of acid. Big budget movies don't get any lazier and more inept than this. If this level of script quality reflects the standard of movies these days (and if the last two seasons of Game of Thrones do the same for TV productions), then we're all **** out of luck.This zero rating isn't given out of spite, it just reflects what I think this movie is worth. Fan fiction will have a hard time managing to be worse than this.",0
89,"What a nightmarish way to end this “Star Wars” trilogy. Unpolished and oddly paced fan service, the movie.",0
90,It's probably the worst movie of the entire saga. It retcon the entire episode VII that was a really good movie and add powers only to be used later and adjust everything.,0
91,"As someone who liked the sequel trilogy so far, TROS is a failure of a film. The writing, directing, editing and many creative choices are deeply flawed. A lot of the film feels bloated and devoid of emotion. It is constantly trying to reference older SW films to the point of desperation, and it is evident that they are trying to undo many things from TLJ. Overall, the film is an absolute mess, plot points lack logic or are very rushed and the whole tone of the film seems off. It's so concerned with getting to the next scene as fast as possible to the point where it never really has an identity of its own and in the end, feels like a film empty of emotion.",0
92,Boring last 30min of movie I want to go sleep.Scenario trash.Thanks Ja Ja Abrams.,0
93,"Here even I still thought that they would at least have listened a TINY TINY bit to their fan's critique, especially after the disasters that were Ep.8 and Solo. So I gave them a last chance. But they made everything worse actually.This movie is obviously the last where Jar Jar Abrams has any say. The movie feels like he just made it to tell the fans a nice farewell-""F*ck you! I make this! Not you! You all are just id*ots anyway!"". Yes, its is THAT bad and completely wasted time and money. Judging from the plot holes and incoherent lore, the makers must literally be thinking the audience has an average IQ of 50 and have never seen the old trilogies or know nothing about Star Wars whatsoever.The only thing I can now hope for is that these episodes are going to be ""remade"" very very quickly. AKA completely new plot and characters. How about next year? And without Kennedy and of course Jar Jar or anyone who even slightly tolerated getting these movies released like that.Or just forget them and never ever mention anything that happened in them, like the Ghostbusters remake.",0
94,"The first act is JJ Abrams forcefully throwing us down stairs so he can tell the story his way.The second act is a series of plot holes, plot regression, and created characters to sell merch.The last act actually does ok, until you start asking yourself how the hell this all happened and how we got here. When compared to the other two films... I guess we can be grateful JJ didn't plagiarize another Star Wars script.",0
98,"Borderline incoherent, messy scripting, disappointing action. A film that feels like the first draft at every point. It's bad yall.",0
99,"Plot consistency and character development is absolutely skipped here, mostly due to lack of time. This movie is packed with all the bad SW things in my opinion - lots of jumping across the universe, explosions, blasters and other fights but at the same time this movie lacks heart, sense and purpose. Bad SW movie, bad movie in general. It's a shame that the beloved saga ends that way - except from few brilliant scenes this is so bad, that the 40% of exposition takes a form of one sentence pushed to you in the same beginning: ""Palpatine is alive, and you're screwed""...and deal with it.",0
100,"What Disney did with Luke Skywalker and all his legacy ... doesn’t have name. They totally broke the concept of the force.Then it is hard to thing which character is more inconsequential...Ben is useless in all the movie and he is only a supper to resurrect Rey ... and the kiss at the end... the people ware literally laughing in the cinema in that moment and seconds later he dies ... everybody else... “wtf”? Rey, all time the same ... totally overpowered... she was training but a moment later she could kill the emperor with full powers.I can write for 1 hour but yeah ... they killed Star Wars... really sad what George Lucas did ...",0

Think Sonic 3 and Knuckles, where you'd beat a level, then get a short scene to explain how you got to the next and nothing else.   Fine for a videogame, but not for a movie.   Constant Macguffin hunting bogged down the movie as well",0
114,"Nostalgia doesn't mean quality, that's all I have to say really. The Last Jedi, besides its many flaws, is a movie that tries to go on a different direction. The Rise Of Skywalker is just trying to be safe, trying to make the fanboys happy.",0
115,"It’s a mess.  Doesn’t feel like a Star Wars movie for 95% of the runtime.  Opening act is jarringly poor, edited like a fan fiction. It’s dismaying to think that this **** is now canon. The first compelling moment of the film, the Rey force lightening accident, is reversed like 5 minutes later, which then becomes a theme.  Abrams and Terrio can’t commit to any stakes, walking back emotional events constantly.   The back half of the film is better than the first but nowhere near good enough.  The writing just **** sucks, it’s obvious they kept rewriting as they made the movie.  The blatant attempts to retcon things from ep8 just exposes the jealousy from abrams towards Johnson’s critical successes and his inability to compete.  Sidelining Rose to appease the racist incels?  They deserve the critical pummeling they are getting. It doesn’t even look that good, 7/8 were visually far superior. The plot just doesn’t make any sense.  Palpatines return is vague and unconvincing, then it’s a video game with macguffins to get to macguffins. Regardless, a bunch of this could have been avoided with a **** outline of the three movies beforehand, what the **** is Kennedy doing here.  I liked ep7 even with the ep4 retread plot, genuinely loved ep8, the message that anyone can be special and that failure is an essential step to growth, and its attempt to break SW out of the same old tropes and into the future, but this is a worse conclusion to the trilogy than I ever thought possible.   Ridley and Driver were somehow still compelling given the bull**** script, and I’ll always pay to see a Star Wars movie opening weekend, but how the **** did this **** not get stopped before it imploded like this. Even the fanboys have to notice how poorly the filmmaking is throughout. Some bigoted space virgins hated the canto bight subplot and that Luke was a grouchy hermit, (which was definitely a plot point that Abrams laid out for Johnson anyways but I digress) so the rest of the world got this rushed dumb movie.  Thanks Disney.   @$). spoiler time  $@&Unanswered q’s-Why is a plot point in the opening crawl not in the movie but only viewable in a video game?  Like really Disney?  The **** is that?Who are the sith eternal?  Ghosts of past Sith Lords?  Just some unknown region folk who really like dark robes and murder?  Just no explanation cool cool.If Palpatine made snoke(s), was he controlling him at all times or just spoke to him like he did through Vader’s mask to Kylo?I mean, how did he actually survive being thrown down the reactor shaft, are we to believe the attendants or other sith buddies grabbed his body before DSII blew up or is the body we see in 9 a clone body as well?  And If he can just transfer his essence or life force into another body why does he need to do it again into Rey?  Just get into one of the spare Snokes or a new Palpy skin.Doesn’t this kinda undo Anakin being the chosen one?  Cool retcon J.J., only the biggest part of the whole **** saga.Yoda looked great as a FG, why does Luke look like he’s the blueberry girl from Willy wonka? Also how is the Xwing fully able to fly? thing had a wing taken off and looked like **** last movie.Speaking of ships, didn’t Rey destroy Kylo’s first Tie fighter on passana and therefore Vader’s wayfinder, Kylo definitely had to take another fighter to Endor and Rey leaves in that and makes it to exegol so what the **** They def remembered to show the wayfinder still plugged in in the ship, but forgot it was blown up 30 min earlier didn’t they?I can go on and on,But lastly, why can’t we **** just use Luke’s green lightsaber?  We get Leia’s never referenced out of thin air saber, but not the second most iconic Jedi weapon in the canon.  Right.I’m not mad you’re mad.",0
116,"Nobody that loves movies and reason can't be in their right mind to express a positive review about this movie. People, we gotta be true, enough with the lies: let's see what we have in front of our eyes. Those who fail to do this will be judged by history. I'm talking about the critic reviews, from the ""professionals"", that I saw coming here today, here today after waiting some days to really understand what I saw. There's a good reason to think that many professionals would be scared to express negativity against the Disney empire, I guess that's the only reason to give a positive review to this... movie: it is an extended trailer.Those people lost all their credibility in this month of December of 2019 where Ep 9 of our beloved Saga has concluded a trilogy of disasters!The movie it's so bad, I couldn't believe that there were people with functioning brains behind this exploit... but apparently there's tons of people and tons of money behind it, but the problem is that they think that the people in the other side are stupid. They thought we would eat everything they would throw at us, because we are blind from the passion: I am afraid that that was a wrong assumption: those people will be judge.This is the conclusion of a way of working and a way of thinking that has gone bad. You can really feel, it is palpable, all the production problems they had. Watching this movie it's like watching a plumber trying to put patches on several holes where water leaks: The more he patches the more other holes form. We all know why this happened. Ep 7 had a direction, Ep 8 destroyed that direction - went in a different way, Ep 9 picked up the new direction ( it was an obligation after all) then also picked up the first direction from Ep 1 and tried to patch all the mess together... well, thanks for this.Almost everything about the movie sucks. There's no Star Wars here! They killed the Star Wars vibe, they did not understood Star Wars. But there's too many bad things to talk about and only 5000 characters! Hey a new fetish has born these days: watching Rant movies! We can thank the new trilogy for that! Fan Rant movies are a thing now, and they are so much entertaining that the movies! why? well: they makes us laugh. Why laugh and not crying in disappointment? Because, silly, you need not to consider this trilogy has canon: Star Wars ended with The Return of The Jedi. That's it. The rest is comedy.The story is nonsensical, the characters have no deepness, the franchise classical vibe it's not there - ever, resulting in the fan service things really forced and a lack of respect... this is a mess.Please do as I do:Do not consider this movies as Star Wars sequels.Let's spread this way of thinking, not because we hate this person or that company, but because the product that was made it's not up to the standards. So yeah, we have the right to deny the ""effort"".I salute you all.",0
117,"Worst Star Wars movie ever made. The Last Jedi is the reason of course, Rian subverted all the expectations until there was no reason to have a trilogy. It's also just very stupid. The script is insultingly stupid. It is not internally consistent within it's own run time, within the new trilogy, nor with the lore of the prior movies. The Force is now a joke. The characters are all just so painful to watch. This is worse than the reboot of ghostbusters.",0
118,"This film was a complete mess. It's all over the place. It's just not fun to watch. The plot is just so bizarre, the pacing is inconsistent, and the action is just boring. If somebody told me a six year old wrote this movie, I wouldn't be surprised whatsoever.",0

122,"This garbage makes no sense at all. And i thought the last jedi was bad, this is a whole other level of stupid. You don't get time to breath, and the whole movie is stuffed with no logic at all. Force ghost can manipulate the force for some reason (then why didn't the dead jedi help Rey?). Palpatine is alive, so why did we need a chosen one to bring balance to the force in the first place? Rey can lift objects, why doesn't she pull everyone out of the quicksand? Lightspeed skip wtf??? I can go and on about Jar Jar Abrams, he **** it up big time.",0
123,"There is so much wrong with this movie. I tried to sit back and enjoy it but there where too many ""what the hell"" moments. There was to many big reviles that went unexplained. There were too many things that broke the laws of star wars. It was the most frustrating star wars film i've ever seen and therefore the worst.",0
124,So many plotholes and stuff that ruin previous event in star wars movie with everything build up to this. So many plot devices that it just becomes ridiculous.,0
125,Great... graphics and that’s probably all. Everything else is just awful and very disappointing what this wonderful movie universe came to.,0
126,I wasn't big on the last Jedi but at least it had ideas. This is just an embarrassing disaster that's somehow worse than both the prequels and the worst of Star Wars Legends,0
127,"This is a bad way to end a saga, this movie is a disappointment, this new trilogy is a **** mess.",0
128,An incoherent story riddled with plot holes. The movie feels like one big run on sentence; flinging you from one plot point to the next at breakneck speed. Just a total cinematic failure...,0

130,"The movie spends half its runtime undoing everything that happened in The Last Jedi. It was not impossible to write a good movie with the constraints imposed by TLJ but they simply chose not to, making the story confusing and devoid of logic.The action scenes are scattered all over the place, with very thin plotlines failing to keep them together. There is no tension in any of the scenes, as the movie constantly undoes any major decision that affects the main (or secondary) characters in a way that could induce someone to feel sad for more that a few seconds.The pacing is terrible, again as a natural conclusion of writing a movie as a mash-up of cool scenes instead of a natural, well thought-out plot.Disastrous.",0
131,"Ah.. It is a confusing, stupid mess. By far the worst Star Wars movie. It feels really unfinished, like a bunch of different screenplays all violently mashed up together - the outcome is a bizarre pile of flashing lights and illogical plotlines with very pale and flat characters. And the biggest problem is that it very much breaks the Star Wars universe as we had known it, as did the Last Jedi before it. Shame.",0

135,"Another weak entry in a once great series. Expands upon force healing, force teleportation and other things in an unearned way that actively makes previous Star Wars movies worse. Rehash of Return of the Jedi with some Empire Strikes Back rehashing crammed in. Brings back Emperor Palpatine and apparently kills him off in a very unsatisfying way. Hey Disney: It's possible to create interesting new Star Wars content that builds upon the existing lore without breaking things. It's called The Mandalorian. In the sequel trilogy, you don't need to ignore what should be a powerful New Republic, or make Disney esque decisions to pretend to kill off Chewbacca, Finn in The Last Jedi and apparently C3PO just to immediately bring these characters back. If you want to kill these characters be bold and just do it.Hopefully future Star Wars movies are better than the ""sequel trilogy"". The characters of Finn and Rey as introduced in The Force Awakens could be used so much better. Star Wars has died as a sad death.",0
136,"Despite some strange and awkward moments that seemed really out of place or unneeded I think if it stuck the landing it would have saved the trilogy and this movie.  The moment Ben brought Rey back to life was where the ending failed for me, after the tale of Darth Plagues being such a strong sith lord he could control life and death  it would really hammer that Rey was a palpatine and only the sith had those powers, and that ben was good all along. Unable to use the dark powers that rey could, he would be forced to accept that he could not control life and death, in contrast to anakin and infact showing he was stronger. They could have then still done the Skywalker homestead scene but with Ben living in solitude and starting a new jedi temple. Outside of the main governing body much like the old jedi. Rey's arc would have started and ended with her being a nobody, and that's the point, she would have become strong on her own, as opposed to the ""prestigious"" Skywalker line.",0

138,"Finally got around to watching this movie. What an absolute mess. The entire plot of the movie is driven by coincidence, convenience, and pure dumb luck. Pacing is awful, the movie literally feels like a whole heap in cinematic trailers strung end-on-end. And chronology is completely all over the place.. like the rebels being able to form up, prepare, dispatch, travel and arrive at *spoiler* in the same amount of time it takes Rey to land and walk inside.... The writing is bad. The plot is dumb as hell. As a finale to the new trilogy, it's a massive fail. As a finale to the entire 9 movie saga, it's a joke.",0
139,Michael Scott: [screaming] NO GOD . PLEASE. NO. NO!!! NO!!! NOOOOOO!!!This movie is a sad meme!!! Please invent a time machine and kill George Lucas before he sells the rights to Disney!!!! Where are you when we need Deadpool?!?!?!,0
140,"This movie should be Titled the fall of Skywalker. The last skywalker dies. Their legacy is taken over by a Palpatine. Palpatine won. He destroyed every Skywalker and replaced them. That's the saddest possible end to the saga and the movie makes it seem like a hopeful and joyful end. Aside from that the movie rushes important parts of the story. The fifteen first minutes are just an awful montage without any logic between the scenes, the force can now carry objects accross space and time, how convenient ! There's no inner conflict in Ben/Kylo before he comes back to the light. This movie could have been so much better and it shatters my heart.",0
141,"Great music, great lighting, great camera angles and great performance. Great SFX / VFX.But the entire storyline and flow is confusing, everything that happens is a big coincidence. The audience is assumed to be dumb brainless idiots and there is no respect for the time and money we spend to go and see the movie. You broke the physics around which the universe was designed so we no longer know what we are wathing. Clearly",0
142,"Total disgrace of Star Wars universe. Half of things don't make sense. They are developing powers and systems from a get go and it's one total mess of stupidity and boringness. For some rock hard haters, previous newer trilogy now must seems as masterpiece.",0
143,So this is how Star Wars dies. With a pathetic whimper of a film. What a mess this trilogy ended up being.,0
144,"I did not enjoy this movie. I tried to like it but when you constantly break lore, trash original characters to the point they aren't themselves, and make the main character stupidly and brokenly op it ruins the feel and immersion I have for the series as a whole. I love Star Wars, but I don't love The Rise of Skywalker at all.",0
145,"This was a ""meh"" movie. Better than TFA and TLJ but not there have been better movies in the franchise. I don't know why 'JJ & Co' place so much emphasis on throwback to the detriment of an actual story. I get it. People like their comfort zones. However, if you want to worry about muppetry so much then may as well use claymation. Those details take me out of the story. The aliens are basically people in costumes with fur. That doesn't do anything for me. Where is the overarching epic story? I mean where is Vader? I know he's dead but shouldn't he cast a shadow on things? His legacy should have been more apparent. I don't feel him at every turn. Sort of like the reboot of Dallas. You felt JR Ewing even when he was gone. He cast such a deep dark shadow on that family. So too should Vader. I got very little emotion from the film except for two scenes. I admit there are two scenes that had me gasping for air. We saw one in the trailer. The fleet of ships. The other was with Kylo. It was good - just didn't feel like it belonged though. It was out of left field (and not the earlier ""hey kid"" one that was out of left field) Still ... it was good. I gasped for air. It was a touching moment.",0
146,I did not enjoy it because it relied only on nostalgia without involving new motives. Most characters except for Rey and Kylo did not have time to develop properly. There were a lot of plot holes which conflicted directly with whole point of I-VI saga.,0
147,"Ill start of by saying the only reason im giving this movie a 3 is because of the CGI and the Fanservice. It's very well made in that regard. Apart from the choreography which is mediocre at best compared to the prequels.Plotwise it must be the worst story consering anything star wars wise. Even most of the Star Wars legends stories have deeper and more well-thought plots than this. Rise of Skywalker? My ass should have been named Rise of Palpatine if something. She is not a skywalker, never will be and never can be, and just because she have the blood of palpatine it doesnt make sense she can everything from the start? It would be different if she was a skywalker due to their high count of midi-chlorians but I never heard anything like that consering the blood of Palpatine. Mastering the Light Saber after no practice beating Kylo Ren who have spent most of his life practicing and mastering the force and light saber. He even have the stronger blood? The reason Palpatine believed in Vader was because he knew he would be stronger than himself?!Second Death Star?! Wtf, It blew up? Remeber that mega explosion at the end of Return of the Jedi? Yeah that one, that was the Death Star. It blew up to **** extinction. How can HALF THE DEATH STAR BE ON A RANDOM ASS PLANET? Like come on. J.J Abrams didnt think this through. Palpatine DIED. Though sure in Legends he survived through clones but eventually got killed. But then again if you watch an interview made with Ian McDiarmid he asked George Lucas if there was any chance he survived, George said No, he's dead, Gone, Mega dead. (Not in those exact words but pretty much sums it up)Like some people before have mentioned regarding Finn - He escaped because he didnt want to fight anymore, yet again the first thing he does is to fight for the ""Rebellion""? Okay. Rebellion? What Rebellion? Didnt they unify the galactic in Return of the Jedi and should have all the resources in the entire GALACTIC to fight this ""First Order nonsense"". If it was that easy for them to take controll of the Galactic that it wasnt even worth mentioning how they got control of it, then why did Palpatine go through all that trouble to form the Galactic Empire? All he had to do was go to Korriban or w/e the name of the planet was in the last movie, cant remeber the name of it... Sit on the throne and wave his stick and bam - He have control of the entire Galaxy. TL;DR If you only want fanservice Star Wars sure you can enjoy it. If you want to experience the plot and enjoy Star Wars to it utmost dont be arsed watching this movie.",0
148,"I heard that those who hated TLJ should like/love this one. Well. No. TLJ is the worst part of the SW universe (next to the Holiday Special) ...but TROS? Still bad, bad, bad. It has its moments...that's why I can't give it less that 3. Ruin Johnson left JJ a steaming pile of dog poop, and JJ had very little to work with, and very little imagination. I'm really disappointed",0
149,2hours and 30 minute movie with 2hours of bad ideas. Messy and under developed. Felt like a fan film on YouTube.,0
150,A race to the finish line. A incoherent mess of poor edits and abhorrent narritive. A plot hole mine field that disrespects the the mythos and the orginal cast.,0
151,"Butchered what was once a great movie franchise. Confirms what many already knew... the latest trilogy is just a rehash of episodes 4, 5 & 6. Undoubtedly without anywhere near as much depth and character arc; it really is just a shower of CGI and puppetry to distract from no plot line whatsoever. Miraculously the film takes a dump all over George Lucas' Star Wars films because Anakin wasn't the ""chosen one"" to destroy the Sith after all. The sith live and so does emperor Palpatine? With more questions left than answers. Uchhh... the worst star wars trilogy ever.I personally would rather sit through 12 hours of Jar Jar Binks on a loop than ever watch Episodes 7, 8 and 9. Perhaps one day we can pretend they never happened. Maybe The Mandolorian can salvage the franchise. Maybe..",0
152,This was probably the best movie we could have hoped for (It was very still bad.)  The Last Jedi left this movie in an unwinnable position.  I don't understand how Disney could have launched this trilogy with no road-map or outline. The damage that this movie has done to the lore is unforgivable. They thought if they threw enough force mysticism at us we would just ignore the plot holes. Well it didn't work.  The plot holes are still there but now we have a bunch of new force powers that basically destroy the franchise.,0
153,"What an insulting end to once a legendary saga, it literally ruins half of the established rules of the universe and basically **** on the og trilogy, the chatacters and onto Disney's own **** canon",0
154,"By far the worst movie of the entire series, viewers will spend the entire time baffled at the characters' stupid decisions and trying to understand the plot. Rey is too overpowered and is completely unrelatable. Her being the granddaughter of the emperor who managed to somehow survive two huge explosions makes no sense and has absolutely no relation to the story. Fighting with horses on the surface of a star destroyer, a ghost able to influence real objects, incredible Force ablilities that are not used when it would make sense for them to be used, the worst actor performance I've ever seen since my 2nd grade play and many more infuriating moments will make you want to bury alive everyone that was somehow involved in producing this monstruosity.",0
155,"This movie is the second worst of this trilogy. The characters and the story were rushed and its not even enough to fix the mistakes from the TLJ. If you want to experience the real star wars then watch the prequels, OT and rogue one.",0
156,"3/4 of the movie are a couple scarce macguffins ( one blatantly  copied for the goonies) , full of plot-holes, a mix of all fandom service. Embarrassing CGI. Poor Post-edition. Disappointing in every way.",0
157,"Fan Service at the cost of a satisfying ending: Sadly The Rise Of Skywalker feels like it is ticking of a list of (the worst) fan based demands. The finale of the entire Skywalker saga is over simplified, rushed and nonsensical in execution. There are a few truly beautiful character moments, however the editing is excessively fast paced and jarring, with a final scene that defies belief. This should have been an emotional culmination of 42 years of pop culture. I wanted to leave uplifted, suffice to say I did not. --- Happily ever after? You be the judge.2 stars are for Adam Driver and Daisy Ridleys wonderful performances. (possibly under duress.)",0
158,"I went into the theater with low expectations for this one, and I was still disappointed. The pacing was horrendous. They threw so much garbage at me that I didn't have time to process how terrible it was. The story was a mess, with so many plot holes (and mcguffin after mcguffin). This was the first star wars movie I found myself bored with in the theater.",0
159,"Well . . . I'm officially done with Star Wars. This movie was bad enough that I don't even enjoy the original series. On the plus side I will save a ton of money because after Rise of Skywalker I no longer love the franchise. I tried watching Empire Strikes Back, one of my favorite go to movies of all time. Watching how bad ass Leia and Han used to be and how Disney imagined their futures is so depressing. If you have any love or nostalgia for the series, don't watch this. It's breathtakingly bad.",0
160,"This is a terribly disjointed film that was too busy ‘fixing’ mistakes from the previous one to actually tell a good story and give an adequate end to a nine film saga. Ultimately, all three films in the trilogy never really matched up and felt out of place, there were a lot of setups in The Force Awakens that were either scrapped or had dull conclusions, which is surprising for a larger franchise that seemed to have everything together. It’s sad seeing this final chapter come to fruition because of how much of a great film it could have been. Not in my canon.",0

166,"The Force Awakens and the Last Jedi are objectively bad movies and even worse Star Wars movies, but Rise of Skywalker destroys decades of brilliant storytelling by George Lucas and creates plotholes everywhere it goes in other trilogies and in it's own. How a single person working on this film didn't stand up and say ""this is dumb, we need a rewrite"" is beyond me. This entire trilogy was put together on the fly without any care and it really shows. I fear that Disney has finally figured out it can quickly and effortlessly throw any garbage with lightsabers on-screen and make billions. Fan-made YouTube Star Wars movies look better and have more soul than this cash-grab nonsense, which is very sad considering the differences in budget. Disney truly is a real-life Evil Empire with the fate of the Star Wars Universe in the clutch of its force choke, who will save us?",0

The manner in which so many small things are undeveloped and so many fan services are so obtrusively made are sickening. The VFX, color and sound team did a stunning job and so did many of the actors, yet everything else about the rest of the plot was so bad and so demeaning. I felt more emotion in a 25 minute elder scrolls online quest than I did the entire movie. A lot of comedic beats seem to have been taken from Marvel's films. But it's NOT a marvel film and what made the universe and original movies powerful was the realness of the deaths, sacrifices and transformations the characters made. Now it's fake deaths, fan service LGBTQ relations (which could be beautiful and meaningful if they were developed), and moments on screen that are supposed to be seen as heartfelt when there was no emotional or relational buildup! This is insanely bad. UP's love story does a better job in 2 minutes than any of the relationships built up in this entire film. So saddened by this loss of opportunity.",0

This is truely something I'd expect to see written on fanfiction.net by a 14 year old.  It truely is a horrible contrived experience.

On closeups the overall picture quality is good and sharp but wide shots suffer from a bit of blur in the 3D version of this movie.Story wise the last movie gets cancelled out and it seems that J.J. doesn't want any other director to mess with his trilogy.

The ending would have been better if Ray turned dark, killed the emperor and kylo fought her in an epic lightsaber battle.",0
178,"Watching this movie felt like a chore that I didn't really want to do.  It’s just bad. It had the right ingredients – it could have been great, but it’s not. The movie is too fast and is paced awfully. The first hour of the movie is very forgettable, it’s like playing a space-version of Skyrim. A bunch of fetch-quests, characters coming into the scene with exactly the information and items necessary to move onto the next scene.  There is some seriously “convenient” (eye rolling) writing to move the plot forward. I wouldn’t have a problem with it if the storytelling was confined to the rules and lore of the Star Wars universe, but it’s not. They could have come to the drawing table for a few days and figured out a better way to tell a story. It lacked suspense, credibility, and integrity.-	Like the two times Kylo was able to figure out where Rey was, based on items that are dropped or was taken from that scene.-	Like how Finn was able to determine where the “beacon” was located once the Final Order had shut down the planet-side one.-	Luke is a force ghost, why would you make the decision for him to “catch” Rey’s lightsaber, and levitate the X wing? He serves the role of mentor to Rey; why not appear behind Rey and say “don’t throw away my lightsaber” or something to that effect?-	The ship Chewbacca was on explodes, but he appears on the Star Destroyer 3 minutes later.-	Rey is Palpatine’s granddaughter – are we just rehashing the same plot points at the old trilogy? You have a $300M budget. Do better. Have some originality. It started getting better near the end, I particularly enjoyed the fact that Kylo Ren/Ben Solo was fighting with a blue lightsaber at the end of the movie.  The visuals and score were both 10/10 as expected - it's a $300M Disney-produced film, it looks and sounds like a Star Wars film., it just doesn’t feel like it.   I don’t often agree with the critics nowadays, but I 100% agree that J.J. Abrams is giving fan service with this movie. Now fan service isn’t inherently bad, but the way this movie does it is just cringe. Han Solo – Fan ServiceLando Calrisian – Fan ServiceEwoks (1 second scene) – Fan ServiceRey and Kylo Kissing – Fan ServicePalpatine as the main bad guy – Fan Service (?)Palpatine was actually pretty good and was integral to the story.",0

181,A cigarette addicted fish could have written a better conclusion. This was absolutely terrible,0
182,"All movie is a mess. End of Skywalker saga is not bittersweet, but just bitter and doesn't make sence. Rey became full-grown Mary Sue, idea of balance between dark and light is tossed aside, and Kylo Ren return to the light side as Ben Solo only to kill himself in a 10 minutes (what a waste of actor's talent!). The ultimate message of the all 9 movies is 'you can correct your errors only with killing yourself' and 'only people who does nothing wrong in their life deserve happiness'.",0
183,"More like an overly long music video than a film. Sometimes it made sense. Mostly, it didn't. Too much exposition. Too much copying of Return of the Jedi. Too many unresolved beginnings. Far too much cheese where it TRIED to evoke emotion but fell flat. Sad.",0

185,"Tries to wrap-up 9 movies... while they have absolutely no plan for the last 3. When there is an agenda and fans don't agree with it, you end up with this creative mess, where on one hand you need to sell enough tickets and on the other hand you try to re-write all SW history. In each movie the 'balance' changes between the dark (a forced agenda) and the light (SW original themes) so we end up with this incongruent trilogy that aims to have the final word on the series.",0

187,"Unimaginably bad. Next time I'll ask Disney to send **** directly to me by post. Graphics was fine, that is +1.",0
188,"This movie is a real mess. Rian Johnson left a lot of possibilities for developing the story in many different [and interesting] directions and I hoped thanks to that we would not get another OT rehash. How stupid I was... Abrams and Terrio created a heartless movie which consists mostly of cheap fan service. The characters do not advance in their development and the plot is completely uninvolving with lots of holes and out of the blue sort of twists. I have a feeling that most scenes here were written just for merch [the same with new characters who are just useless from the plot perspective]. This film is everything that SW are not and it's a pity we got another MCU superhero like movie instead of something more insightful and thought-provoking like ""The Last Jedi"". The action speeds and goes so fast you don't have time to think about what you see, the editing is just horrible [who the hell cut this movie?], the cast do not even pretend they are doing their best and what's more ""The Rise of Skywalker"" tries to recton ""TLJ"" so hard that it's just a pain to watch it. I wish this movie had never been made, it's just a joke and should be treated this way. It destroys prequels and original trilogy, but also flushes the new canon in the toilet. I do not envy LF story group...after this ""masterpiece"" they will have to patch the lore and it won't be easy...I think it's justified to refer to Abrams as Jar Jar from now on. For all this mess he has made... The only positive aspect of the movie is Adam Driver [hence 1 out of ten, not 0] who does incredible things on screen being given maximum five lines of the text throughout the movie. Although his character could have been written much better, the actor seems to be the one who cares. The rest...just to forget, bury deep down under the ground and pretend it had never existed.",0
189,Possibly the worst movie of 2019. Even Dark Phoenix was sort of watchable. This does no justice to the original trilogy and no service to any of the new characters except for overpowered Rey. So the story is abysmal. Is the film enjoyable if you turn your mind off and just let it wash over you? Not at all. It's poorly edited and it just rehashes scene after scene that we have already experienced before. It offers nothing new or fresh and the fan service it provides is rather desperate and sad.,0
190,This movie tries to right the wrongs of previous entry so at least an improvement but fails as a movie. Rushed and nonsensical. This has a lot of fan service but the sequel trilogy plunged so far into a sarlacc pit that it was too late.,0

197,"I went into the cinema with an open mind, hoping this would be better than what I have seen previously. This is the first time ever, I have sat in the cinema watching star wars and got bored and wanted to walk out. First let's look at this film as a stand alone film outside the context of the star wars universe.- Apart from a few main characters most of the characters completely lack any sort of development and are rather 1 dimensional.- The plot was painfully simplistic in a world that was poorly built, child like in its conception almost, I have seen better stories and world building emerge from D&D games.- It appeals to nostalgia too much in an attempt to retain a fan base.- At points it attempts to be humorous, attempts being the appropriate word.- Cliche such as ""I want to shoot you but secretly still love you"" present, from yet another criminally underdeveloped character.- Merchandising character placement neither subtle nor tasteful, a new droid character was added clearly for this purpose alone.- Poorly explained plot points, how can C3PO read sith but is unable to speak it, where did that massive fleet come from exactly, how was a giant manned fleet constructed on a planet no one can get to, etc? - Plot armor, serious main character survive ability, from storm troopers missing at point blank range (something you would hope the creators of star wars would have learned from previous films) to main characters dying then not being dead. Any sense of risk for the party we follow is just completely lost.- Rey is a Mary Sue, there is nothing she isn't good at and why she is the best/almost the best at any given task is not explained.The film is a lazy edition to the star wars universe and here are issues it has in relation to this:- power creep, the previous films had increasingly larger planet destroying weapons, the last of which could destroy multiple with 1 shot. Now we are presented with an entire fleet of planet destroying weapons.- more power creep, the force can do anything now, this introduces plot holes in previous films as, ""Why didn't they just force heal them?""- inconsistent Palpetine writing, he was always about personal power, now he wants to die and ""merge"" with someone?- Main characters, just get sidelined as if they are no longer important to the story.There is more but I think this is enough to paint the picture. A terrible film from start to finish. The only saving grace is the space battles were pretty. Poorly developed characters, in a poorly developed world, with a simplistic plot.",0
198,"However a great addition to the sequel trilogy, it is a terrible ending to the skywalker saga. This is because reviving and revamping emperor palpatine was terrible decision and just bad writing. This is because this being done , ruins the plot of the original trilogy and also makes death Vader (The most beloved villain is the skywalker saga) redemption story lacklustre and pointless. And relying on a good memorising character to repurpose and revamp a bad trilogy to try to end a beloved saga is just lazy writing. However this direction taken could be good but jj abrams took a different route to make it a ambitious the return of the Jedi end which was not the write call or at least the way he executed it , it wasn’t this is because a redemption story of kylo REN just destroys the plot of the original trilogy also this could have been great but the final battle was so lacklustre and just destroys palpatines character also reylos kiss felt forced and stupid also princess lea death felt forced however considering the actors death it is also more insulting to her character and her character should’ve took a different rout. Overalls the only good thing good about the movie are the cinematic scenes and fight but overall a horrible addition to the skywalker saga Also this movie is so **** it didn’t take any risks and didn’t develop any character except ren this is because Rey kill chewie a good thing to develope character for both characters and give rey a reason to fight but noooo we have to monitise this saga and need crewie to do that so they bring him back what a pathetic movie and jj please never direct again.",0

Much like the intro of the film, the pacing of the film follows ""light speed skipping"". They retconned Rey's backstory and pulled some 11th hour heresy with Palpatine to try and hype the film up and arbitrarily create some antagonist out of the blue yonder. ANOTHER desolate desert planet. ANOTHER random forest planet. MORE Planet Killing weapons. MORE Palpatine. 40 years in the making and this is literally some fanfiction caliber crap protruded out from Corporate Disney that's a rehash of Return of the Jedi.",0
204,"a terrible amalgamation of inconsistency and bad ideas. the plot is a 1000 mph mcguffin chase while being constantly beaten over the head with member berries from better films to try to distract you from the fact that literally nothing is making sense. while this film had a very difficult job of following what the last jedi gave it, it failed to meet even the low expectations that many had for it given the context. outside of good interactions from finn and poe, john williams' eternal greatness, anthony daniel's c3po, and a new alien character that is in the film for 20 seconds(providing more character in that time than the block of wood Rey did in 3 films) the movie is an unmitigated trainwreck",0

It tries to do some different stuff but then still takes a lot of ideas from the older movies. The worst part is how Palpatine is a super fun part of the prequels but he feels extremely boring and silly in this movie. You could pick a random Star Wars nerd out of a crowd to write a better screen play than this. You could pick someone who isn't sure what Star Wars is. I don't know if the people who made this movie are incompetent or if they were just forced by Chinese standards or executives to sterilize the movie into an extremely boring mess.

214,"So, to recap the finale of The Last Jedi...Rebel fleet is being pursued by the First Order, and manages to get to the last bolthole base in which to try and make a final stand. Luke Skywalker utilises the Force to combat Kylo Ren and buy the rebels more time. Po has been tasked with setting up a defence by Leia who came back from the dead and finally regains consciousness.Rose has shown her love for Finn by crashing her land speeder into his as he was about to sacrifice himself by ramming the First Order's big laser gun thingie. And finally Rey creates a way for the Rebels to escape, all of them being able to cram on board the Millennium Falcon, but only with the clothes on their backs, after Admiral Holdo pulls of a light-speed attack manoeuvre which cripples the First Order's fleet.Cue the opening crawl of The Rise of Skywalker (TRoS)...And absolutely nothing is mentioned to reference anything from the prior film. Instead we learn that Emperor Palpatine has been calling out to Kylo Ren, and thus didn't die at the end of RotJ. But in order to find him he need some special, never before mentioned, Sith locator/map device  which leads to a secret Sith base/temple/planet/whatever. So Ren is seen slaughtering some unnamed creatures to retrieve it. He heads there, and meets Palpatine who says he can offer Ren all the secrets of the Dark Side of the Force, in exchange for killing Rey...And that's all in the first five minutes!!What follows is two hours of utter nonsense as Rey and the gang go off in search of another one of these Sith map devices, while Ren is intent on killing her. We also discover that in the 30(?) years since the battle of Endor, Palpatine has had dozens of Star Destroyers built (and found tens of thousands of people to crew them) and wants to create the Last Order..All of this culminates in Ren letting go of the Dark Side and re-embracing his own origins, whilst Rey has to come to terms with a revelation about her origins and the lure of the Dark Side. Eventually Rey and Ren take on Palpatine, and with a lot of self-sacrifice the Jedi are triumphant.It's a terrible film though. The fact is pretty much junks everything from TFA and TLJ to go off in a completely different direction (story-wise) suggests that the writers couldn't find a way to continue the original narrative to a satisfactory conclusion. So, they just brought back Palpatine, offering up that new villain, rather than digging deeper into either Kylo Ren's or Rey's backgrounds.The only saving grace are the special effects, the score and the commitment of the actors.",0
215,"I am admittedly not the biggest Star Wars fan, but I’ve tried to give each episode a try ( although I bailed on the last movie the minute Luke was sloppily drinking milk from some animals tit.) And the last best fav movie of mine and all time fav scene ever in the history of any Star Wars movie was when Darth Vader, the world’s best-ever bad ass hilariously told Wussy Luke Skywalker that he was his father! Lol. Listening to Luke cry and whine like a little bi@tsch was priceless and still remains as the best scene ever.Fast forward to this pile of muck and what you’re watching is a tepid, politically correct, weak, made for millennials & kids, toy sales advertisement with zero meaningful storyline and just a bunch of meaningless action scenes stitched together (like this run-on sentence) that add very little to the overall storyline.The women, as to be expected in this PC jaunt are the strong heroes in this 21st century made mess, while the men are portrayed as weak, ancillary add ons that are just along for the ride....Even Kylo Ren is the wussiest, lamest, softest shelled, wimpiest bad guy ever portrayed.  (Not to mention the worst casting in Star Wars history ever.). It’s painful to listen to and watch him speak he’s so weak... And there are so many times in this movie we are reminded of this.  And why does he keep taking off his helmet? It’s like if Darth Vader took off his helmet and we got Pee Wee Herman being a bad guy. Disney writers never learned the value of holding their audience in suspense in favor of contract terms promising to show Adam Driver’s face X # of times.  He should have NEVER been revealed- NEVER - until the final moment.And somehow, out of nowhere they magically Seem to be walking and riding horses in outer space. WHAT THE WHAT!!??  ",0
216,"First of all I want to make it clear that I am a star wars fan, but of those who are not against the new stories, I loved rebels, rogue one is very good and they have only defended themselves although tabien is a little lazy.But this last trilogy is FATAL and this last movie is ABOMINABLE.He leaves more questions than answers, he says goodbye to so many wonderful characters and in such bad ways that they are sad.If I start to say everything that is wrong I honestly never end.But let's talk about the most ridiculous:-Armitage hux spy? his reasons, I don't want kylo ren to win !! what??-Ray, she had enough of a little training to become almost a goddess of force who could have become empress !! osea sidius had to learn for years and she just woke up one day and is the greatest thing that has happened to her by force, she controls minds, throws lightning bolts, she has a super sixth Jedi sense and she has HEALING POWERS, she only needs to throw laser your eyes and freeze with your breath-kylo ren osea how many times he was asked to be good suddenly he loses against ray his han appears, that nobody tells us where he comes from or if he is not a ghost in the force, but he appears and convinces him to become good, so just 3 minutes and zaz is good, says dad and throws his red saber- The emperor bone this dude is suddenly dying and what a coincidence two super powerful jedis arrive, but that in front of a dying sith they cannot be more than insects and apart from what coincidence he can take life from them so he absorbs their energy and does everything powerful and begins to throw rays TO THE SKY, which is not the most surprising if not that with its rays it begins to destroy ALL of its enemies, but when those rays that brought down my ships are focused on ray for all rays with its saber, so WHAT? oh and so the WORST ENEMY SITH dies, the most evil and powerful dude, with his rays bounced by a saber -.-, so suddenly he is gone and the war and everything is over !!BUM! Everyone happy; well less ben because he sacrifices himself to save ray and there with the death of ben the SKYWALKERs end there ah well but they do not end because ray decides not to be a palpatine, so just by his desire he says I am SKYWALKER then he dies lineage but does not die.I'm sorry but I must say it:GARBAGE ALL THE FILM IS GARBAGE",0

It was rushed, try to fix tlj, making up forces powers like the force is used to move the plot. the interesting plot which did not get explored (Finn had to tell Rey something but never does). bring Palpatine back was a joke. this whole trilogy undermines Anakin's sacrifice and the victory of the rebels. the avenger's endgame ending was uncreative and just dumb. JJ just made everything bigger to create suspense not using emotion as Rots or ROTJ did. ben solo dies 3 times (ship crash, stabbed, yeets off a cliff) than they expect us to feel emotional for his actual death, it just left me wondering what just happened and how did he die. I just hope the executive at Disney leaves the film making to true fans who know how star wars work and let the filmmakers have a proper production and a clear road map before they making the film.",0

229,"Is it a good story, told well? The Rise of Skywalker tries to distance itself from The Last Jedi and feels like a direct sequel to The Force Awakens. Not surprising given the director of this installment, the backlash to The Last Jedi and the corner that installment painted the sequel trilogy into. I consider The Last Jedi to be a parody. A farce. Mocking itself, mocking Star Wars, mocking certain characters and mocking the audience. How very subversive, but that's not what Star Wars is for me and for many others. Star Wars follows in the tradition of myths, Greek myths amongst many other mythologies and philosophies etc. The Hero With a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell. The Hero's Journey. There's humor throughout the Star Wars movies but Star Wars is also grounded in its own reality and takes itself seriously overall. The Mandalorian is back to basics, feels very like Star Wars and has proven to be successful. The Last Jedi tried to deliberately break with thousands of years of traditional storytelling and broke it. The Rise of Skywalker is entertaining in places, but I cannot escape the numerous plot holes rendering it as too incoherent. Head scratch. There are inconsistencies throughout the Star Wars movies including the original trilogy. I grew up with/on the original trilogy, I wasn't and am not a prequel trilogy hater. Crucially for me, bringing back Emperor Palpatine in The Rise of Skywalker; I do not agree with this current trend of 'revisionism' and especially 'revisionism' of the Star Wars mythos. I will not be watching any of sequel trilogy ever again. The Skywalker Saga ends on the forest moon of Endor, preferably to 'Yub Nub.' “(Star Wars is) political in a sense that it has a foundation in historical politics — the rise of dictatorships, the death of democracy — but it has never tried to take a stand on present-day issues,” former Lucasfilm executive Howard Roffman. Everyone and anyone has the potential to become a hero, and can take the Hero's Journey. The path does not go through hypocrisy and or by stepping on others to get there.",0

The theater was laughing in disbelief within 15 minutes. The list of plot holes is a mile long. Characters were not given a moment to breathe or process anything that was happening.The Rey/Ben Solo interactions were one of the few plotlines with any soul or scrap of consistency. Children came out of the theatre crying because of Ben's death. Ultimately, the Skywalker legacy is erased, co-opted by the Palpatine line. Plus, Disney killed off their biggest money maker. I couldn't dream up a worse movie if I tried.",0

You can see how absolutely crazy and hectic this writing is within the first hour and honestly could barely stand watching it to the end. The prequels are better than this **** in my opinion. Only good thing in this film was the visual FX and the acting. Poor Finn's only job was to yell Rey's name",0
236,Abrams takes everything from the last Jedi and basically retcons it. Horrible pacing. Cheap plot conveniences.  The force is not magic Disney. This trilogy makes no sense. The saga ends with a non sky walker being the lone survivor.,0
237,"It's definitely better than the previous episode...cant imagine anything worse than the 8th episode though.Have no idea why Disney needed to revive Palpatine. I see this as a sign of lack in new ideas. I can see clearly that even at the very begining of this triology Disney had absolutely no vision of where their story is actually going. So that's also clear that all this triology'd been made only to get more money from fans and never for SW universe development.The story itself in 9th ep is plain, not interesting at all and has really big contentious issues. The characters are plain, Rei is OP and you have absolutely no compassion for her. All the dialogs are really either dry or strange. All the humor parts have jokes of really, REALLY bad quality (I wanted to kill myself at leats every time C3PO'd opened its mouth). The decisions characters made were stupid. All I could do in the cinema was laugh and discuss all these stupid moments with my brother. I think if I was on my own in the cinema, I'd stand up in the middle of the movie and walk away.The only reason I give 1 to this episode is that it's much better that the previous one and it's FINALY the end of the triology made only to grab loads of money from fans.You can do good movies. Just look at the ""Rogue One"". I can see this movie was made with huge love for SW universe. Look at ""Mandalorian"" series. These two examples can give you some idea, WHAT EXACTLY all the fans wanted to see. Even the first 10 mins of 1st Mandalorian episode is better that all the new triology.I deeply love SW universe. And all I can see looking at this new triology is only disrespect for your viewers. It's really weak triology even comparing with the weakest Marvell movies. So don't you think that all the negative feedback is only because of some crazy fans of SW. Think carefully if you want continue to make another SW stories. Think of the STORY first. That should do it.My only hope is that you Disney will not make a mess like that with the entire Old Republic and especially with Revan.Don't be afraid to leave negative feedback and describe what you feel. Disney needs to know that they did the whole thing wrong, so next time we may be able to have really good story with interesting characters that will make you hold your breath.

264,"As a lifelong hardcore Star Wars fan, I can honestly say that this film is a completely irredeemable pile of garbage.  I regret the $10 and two and a half hours spent watching it.  I had no idea a Star Wars film could be made that was so terrible that it would make me kind of like The Last Jedi, but this film succeeded in doing exactly that.This movie made me want to watch The Phantom Menace, but only the parts with Jar Jar, just to remind myself how good Star Wars used to be.  This movie made me want to go back and edit my old review of The Force Awakens to say ""Don't bother watching this, it doesn't well.""  The only thing that would make this film worth a home video purchase is if you plan to incinerate the box, or throw it away for comedic effect like Ron Swanson with vegan bacon.The plot is nonsensical, the script is poor, it earns exactly zero of its heavy emotional moments and I still, after three movies, don't care about any of these characters.  I wish they all died.  The talented cast is completely wasted on this script that was clearly written for and by idiots.  It has the gall to reanimate the corpse of Carrie Fisher to do absolutely nothing in 20 minutes of screen time while completely failing to use Mark Hamill for more than 90 seconds.That's all.  It's bad, it's insulting, and you shouldn't watch it.",0

Characters wander off and reappear out of nowhere, looking for something they need without knowing why. All is on a straight line, yet goes in circles. Everybody runs as fast as they can, so no one moves at all...As with TLJ, I have to say I have never seen a big studio blockbuster like that. But where TLJ tried to tell a different story, here it seems like Disney gave up after the backlash and now retreats into the vague and atmospheric, where it feels like SW, but literally does nothing, so no one can complain.So, one point for archiving exactly what they wanted, one point for set- and sound-design, Adam Driver, Babo Frik, and how happy everybody is in the end, and no more points, because there literally is nothing else.",0

273,The final in the 'jj and kk star wars'  trilogy was an incoherent mess of ideas that once again felt completely alien from the Lucas 6. Is it a poorly produced film? Not by a stretch but the way it sodomizes the material is inexcusable and so the score is that much lower. Someone trallt messed up with these movies. Stick to the Lucas sextuplet.,0
274,"The plot is rushed and filled with holes (so many good questions for another time: when you buy the various books I guess), the action scenes are extremely generic, the lightsaber battles are poorly choreographed (especially compared to the prequels that went all out on that front) and Abrams tries to deliver some emotional moments but they mostly feel cheap and flat: Chewbacca and C3PO fake deaths, ""Dark Rey"" 5 seconds scene (did anybody actually think she would turn?), the Reylo kiss (yikes, totally out of place)... Also, that's not how the f-ing force works! Force healing, Force vision (that's how Kylo has that conversation with Han Solo apparently), Force Skype calls, Force Skype battles (dafuq?), Force Amazon deliveries and that ""Dyad"" **** which origin is never explained...Anyway, Youtube is filled with videos explaining it better and in more details than me.

I like Daisy Ridley as Rey, too bad she plays the stereotypical and generic strong female protagonist (Mary Sue) with no development or weaknesses, just innately the best at everything. Then we have the multicultural and inclusive good guys, that fulfill every quota, against the evil white males. Action scenes are good if you can ignore the many cliches and deus ex machina that take away all tension.This movie is a huge disrespect to Star Wars lore and plotwise it was impossible to recover from the mess made by the last one.

Most reviews I see complain that the movie spent too much time giving true original fans a pat on the head. However for me the nods to past films were completely ineffective and only made me angry that they weren’t showing me enough. The people in the theater along with myself spent most of the movie scratching their heads, throwing their hands in the air in confusion, and I even heard a “Awwww JJ nooooo”. I can’t express my disappointment enough.",0
296,"This movie is without a doubt not worthy of the name star wars. The entire experience of watching this movie is like watching something in which the cast and crew did just because they were contractually obligated to. The movie resorts to recycling characters already dead from past movies without even a good explanation. Relies on insane video game like plot devices that dont cash out at the end, amd convert the characters in somehow the most out of place and stupid characters ever. People like to blame the previous movie for this, but the fact is that the previous one is a masterpiece when compared to this one, but then again even die hard 5 is a master piece compared to this one. It's a quick cash grab, a total waste of time.",0

Sure, the used the name, some lore, but in the end this is not Stars Wars.Rise of Skywalker takes everything we knew about previous stories, lore, canon, and either throws it out or just makes a complete mockery of it.  It makes the sacrifices Anakin, Luke, Liea,  Han, Chewbacca and everyone else made mean absilutely nothing - because JJ Abrams thought it would be a good ideal to bring Palpatine back from the dead.  The movie is a convoluted mess of bad writng, pacing, and laced with plot holes(dozens - literally dozens), and lets not forget all the stupid mcguffins that are so contrived and conveniently resolved within seconds.  Yes...just stupid assinine writing that should insult you as a viewer.  If I were you, do not wate your money.  Save it.  Wait until it is released and see it on TV or wait for a friend to buy it on disc.",0
310,This movie was a complete mess with an unbelievable reliance on undeserved fan-service to try and distract you from it's awful writing. Entire character arcs are forgotten or contradicted while adding nothing valuable as replacement. The movie simply doesn't have any clue what it wants to do with itself ends up accomplishing nothing because of it.,0
311,"This Movie tries to fix the disaster that was The Last Jedi, but too much was broken, it didn't work and just feels like a continuously broken chase scene",0
312,"It's tragic. Nothing got me on the edge of my seat, a single scene inspired nothing else got me all that interested. I was a bit amazed in scenes but I expected that from such a massive company. The movie is to afraid to be more than fan service I think, with McGuffins for Mary Sues. The contrast between Kylo and Rey (light and dark) been the only part I kinda liked but been inherently flawed, kylo never had a advantage or posed a threat to Mary Sue. To me this made his change, predictable and disappointing. It's not worth been completely negative. The only fan service part I liked was luke raising his X wing, and the scene of Rey been down as all the previous jedi support her telling her to ""rise"". Personally thats all I liked. The major parts that didn't work for me. The constant poorly implemented ""link"" between Rey and Kylo, the constant forced FaceTime where some how there can still be damage to the surroundings. The scene of Rey seeing her evil side, doesn't carry any impact. It's completely skipped over and has no impact. Rey burying the lightsaber is a mix I get how some liked it, to me it didn't work at all and is frustrating. The absolute worst part is she immediately pulls out an amazing looking lightsaber of her own I imagine. Sporting a yellow blade, possible duel function and potentially an amazing scene of her creating it but no. Her taking the name of skywalker is underserved I think. There is more but thank you for reading this much.",0
313,"First. If you want to go to a movie and shut your brain off, this is fine for that. Individual set pieces are gorgeous and are well shot; part of the Abrams crux. He's all style and no substance.The second you think for a moment on anything in the film, the parts do not support the whole. The writing is terrible with awful plot holes, retconning bot the original trilogy and the mess Rian Johnson made in the Last Jedi, negating the CRUCIAL Anakin redemption cycle in the original. This made the writing of the Prequals seem like Shakespeare. First, Rian wrote the whole story into a corner with no where to go, with any and all question from Awakens being destroyed, which is then retconned in this film and makes flimsy answers to questions posed in Awakens. New characters introduced were utterly pointless and barely have screen time...why would they? Its the last film in this trilogy, there isn't even a point to developing them or introducing them.The force, dear God almighty. They **** that up. Rey is space Jesus; she heals, she force skypes with Kylo, she pulls ships from the sky, she deflects lighting...she can't be beat. No character development, no earning of power, no rise or fall or climax or point of crisis for the character that would ground her as an identifiable or relatable person. The pacing of the film, which was all over the place to cram as much exposition as possible and I understood to a degree with JJ trying to right the ship, was almost forgivable...but the film lost me completely when through the Kylo-Rey force skype, Kylo ripped a bead necklace off of Rey (Which she got at the Alien Burning Man festival in the film...no joke) THOUGH THEY WERE LIGHT YEARS APART and was able to track her down with this necklace. My suspension of disbelief only goes so far.Palpatine, lets address this **** It isn't even a spoiler, they tell you he is back in the opening Star Wars crawl!!!! THis was a damn Hail-Mary...with no where to go story wise, JJ said **** it"" and brought the Emperor back...no explanation how he lived, he has pickled Snokes in jars (clones), an a fleet of star destroyers buried in the planet surface that just rise up.",0
314,"If you are a casual fan then you can probably find aspects of the film to enjoy. Other than that it’s a very miss film in my opinion. The characters do not get the proper send off that they deserve and it feels like a movie just as an effort to sell more merchandise. It was extremely predictable with the major “twists” or plot points being seen from a mile away whether it was Landos return, Rey being a palpatine, Finn being force sensitive or any of the other shocks it tried to create. There were no good light saber battles and every single Princess Leia scene was extremely forced and uncomfortable to watch. She was speaking super vaguely and you could tell they were just trying to incorporate her into the movie for the nostalgia factor. They also CGId her which they said they were not going to do. They did redeem certain characters like Kylo however then they completely ruin the momentum of the character by killing him off in a very stupid way. They also underutilized many characters. Overall it was disappointing it was not as terrible as the last Jedi but that does not make this movie a good film by any means.",0
315,"This movie moves at break-neck speeds to establish new villains, undo mistakes from previous movies, and to resolve all new plot points before the credits roll. The pacing is fast that you cannot even comprehend the internal inconsistencies and disregard for the franchise's history lest you blink and miss critical plot points. Any scene long enough to actually rouse any feelings from the audience are undone only minutes later. Once the movie is over and realize this the official end for Disney's new Star Wars trilogy it's painfully clear that there was never a plan for this trilogy and it was never given the respect it deserved by the executives at Disney.",0

But this is two and a half hours of nonsense that I couldn’t care less about combine with blatant, cynical heartstring-tugging.  Ugh.

I’ve re-written the story into a livable version in my head. One thing I will say...it should’ve been 2 more movies at least. We’re rebels, right? Who says there can only be three? You can’t tell a story for forty two years and then ride out with half a story because some stupid rule from a long time ago says three.",0

It spends so much time trying to retcon all the plot issues TLJ created that it had absolutely no idea what to do with itself other than try to haphazardly rehash what has previously worked. Palpatine is still a corny ass old fart, Rose get COMPLETELY forgotten (I mean, she probably shouldn't have existed in the first place, but its too late now so you need to do SOMETHING with her.) Finn does absolutely nothing and his character is shafted by the inclusion of a bunch of other ex-storm troopers, which takes away anything special about him. Poe sits there and does nothing significant for the 3rd movie in a row. The plot is strung together by the smallest of threads that come out of nowhere and leave without any explanation (except for the awkward re-writing that Disney has been trying to do post release with their online explanations) The lightspeed skipping directly gives the middle finger to Holdo's maneuver and the whole death star thing makes ZERO sense because I literally saw it obliterated in Episode 6.",0

As a result this film end up being completely unsatisfying and derails this trilogy completely by exposing, if it wasn't clear before, that there was no plan in place from the start.",0
358,"this movie is by far the worst one seen so far, not only are powers taken out of nowhere and they could have served other protagonists to avoid deaths like the Qui-Gon Jinn, being able to simply obi wan heal him with the crazy healing ability they gave him to king and that is another negative point the crazy powers that king develops in this movie do not make sense like they have never had in this series of movies but here still more he is being able to learn 1 skill of a high rank sith as the rays of the force 2 new ones that have never been seen in the saga as being able to teleport sabers and heal people convenience right? that is what abounds in this movie, as palpatine is still alive they do not explain it to you he is simply alive for the convenience of the script and this also destroys everything that luke achieved in addition to taking away all the weight that the redemption of darth vader / Anakin Skywalker had It also creates stupid things like that the star destroyers can only have one command antenna per ship. You are telling me that they can make hundreds of ships that can destroy planets and that you can also make a command antenna to control all ships. and you can make a miniature version of this to place it in a star destroyer but you can't do the same with all the other ships that the hell is this, another hole would be that the millennial falcon uses its space jump 3 times in a row and nothing happens to it convenience gentlemen and another hole would be that you can dig on top of a destroyer and nothing happens to them and as if all this were not enough they can destroy Go ships to bloody arrows, and besides this is not all, they also make jumps that characters reach their destination without any explanation, such as Kailo Ren who arrives at the palpatin lair when before he was standing in the middle of nowhere and the most unforgivable of all. They clickbait with the title because in this they tell you that it will be the promotion of the Skywalkers when that never happens because all the Skywalkers die, where is the **** promotion of the Skywalkers if they all end up dead? that is all that in short the film seemed to me a trash can that not only creates without plot senses (as palpatine from one moment to another pass from wanting to kill the king to want it alive), uses the plot conveniences in his favor (making For example, the millennial falcon does not crash after making 3 space jumps), it puts a very feminine character just for being feminine (king learning 3 rotissimo skills having trained little and nothing) but also destroys everything that the word Skywalker means the score of 0 is earned",0
359,"Rise of Skywalker is a truly bad, beyond belief bad. My opinion of the Sequel Trilogy as a whole, is that Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is the only good Sequel Trilogy movie. The Force Awakens and Rise of Skywalker, both written and directed, by JJ Abrams, both are terrible movies. The cast and the VFC are pretty good across all the Trilogy, but the problem is named JJ Abrams. I don't understand how they didn't fired him mid-filming. Abrams has not a single creative bone, this is the bad-remake of Return of the Jedi w that we all feared after seeing the bad remake of A New Hope that Abrams called The Force Awakens. There is this bit that made me angry and want to leave the theater. It was when Luke picked the sword. Luke famously threw it at the end of Return of the Jedi, this to save his father Anakin/ Darth Vader (this was Luke's whole character development, the character defining moment). Then he famously threw it again at the beginning of The Last Jedi, this time to save would be Kylo Ren nephew, Ben Solo. Luke Skywalker picking the sword and telling Rey to never throw it? It felt out of character, worse a full character betrayal. JJ Abrams wanted to apologize for the previous film and made it worse, a thousand times worsSe. The implication of that quote is that Luke regrets not killing his enemies. Despite that trait being Luke's best strength, his pityy towards his enemies  By doing that, Luke regretted his pacifism. The whole arc of the previous film was Luke choosing pacifism. This development is a 180, that happened off-screen. Is unjustified, it contradicts the character whole life.Then every single character revives innthis film. Not even only Palpatine (which is anoying never explained). Chewbacca also revives, and Babu Fric, and Rey and Kylo Ren. So the death feels chepa. Because the villian revived a clear death. Why should we believe this death?Nothing makes sense, the editing is so hyperactive that it feels like a videogame speed-run. Characters are hyperactively trying to skip to the next scene. Millennium Falcon skip is a good metafore for the rest of the movie.Then Rey's parentage contradicts the previous nmovie, it doesn't add anything to the plot. Is rushed, under developed. You could remove the plotline and still get the same ending. Then those 2 female new characters, are nott but glorified extras (seriously the worst 2 Star Wars characters, Captain ""give up without fighting"" Phasma as written by JJ Abrams in The Force Awakens is also there but is better because Rian Johnson at least gave her a fight in Last Jedi). I would had rather seen Rose Tico get an arc. At least she was a character. Then, the Knights of Ren are embarrassingly bad, is like 6 Boba Fett deaths, even Snoke's red guards from The Last Jedi got more to do, why do the Knights of Ren feel like the dollar store version? Hux was in previous 2 films, he deserved better than being killed midway, he could have at least been a great Agent Callus remake ( Rebels cartoon, imperial deflector) or let him go to tow to toe against Kylo Ren, with Palpatine's help. Those flaws and retroactively ruining characters, result in JJ Abrams being the sole author of the top 10 worst Star Wars characters. Knights of Ren *6, Phasma 7, Hux 8, the 2 lady extras are 9 and 10. JJ Abrams is that bad a writer/director.I suppose that Palpatine being Snoke's master explains where Snoke's money came from. But, Palpatine gets nothing to do in the rest of the movie. Then, using him to do a lazy remake of Vader's redemption. This JJ Abrams is lazy. I would had rather seen the un-redeemed version from the leaked script that JJ Abrams discarded. That battle of Coruscant also sounded better.I hated the 1000 Star Destroyers with Death Star powers, why not just letting Palpatine use Death Star planet destroying powers himself!? Some unseen characters destroy the ones on Endor and Jakuu!? Why? How poorly where they made, if everyone and their dog defeated one!? Same dollar store as Knights of Ren!?The desert planet Passana felt like it could had been another city on Jakuu or Tatooine, but they changed the name last minute. The fact that those poor desert planets imitations, appear across the Trilogy. It made Tatooine's appearance in the final shot, less special.Rey Skywalker was a bad twist. She already was Luke's apprentice, the last name was overkill. Just simply Rey, would had been more feminst. Better. I didn't liked",0
360,This movie is simply terrible. It tries to repair the damage done by the Last Jedi and simply can not do that with zero character development or story. It just reaches into the expanded universe (legends) and pulls some nostalgia out of it and ruins that as well. Now that the terrible saga is over. Disney fire Kathleen Kennedy offer an apology to fans make  legends cannon and reboot.,0

The whole movie is a rehash of old ideas stitched together. Going from one ""Huh!"" moment to another. 3 for spectacular presentation but otherwise there isn't much of a movie in there.",0
364,"The Rise of Skywalker is the Fall of Disney Star Wars - for Kathleen Kennedy, a disaster in commercial and critical terms - and for fans, a betrayal of George Lucas's 6 films. Why? Anakin Skywalker - the one who brings balance to the Force by going from good to evil (Vader) and back again by killing the Emperor - is betrayed. The Emperor's grand daughter Rey is the saviour - she supplants Anakin as the hero, and the Palpatines become the victors. This undermines everything more that The Last Jedi - it undermines everything Lucas did. All in the name of vapid, Mary Sue feminism. No matter how much money it made, how slick it looked, how much Daisy Ridley's eyes bugged out - this is one disaster of a film. Iger should fire KK and put Jon Favereau and Dave Filoni in charge - as there work on The Mandalorian and The Clone Wars proves, they feel the Force and the Force is with them.",0

But when those CGI scenes literally come out of no where (ie here are 1000 star destroyers because _____) it just gets gratuitous.  And the pain of finally realizing that Disney actually had no plan for this trilogy - that they actually winged it... it made me concerned about the times we live in.  I won't even walk to the corner store without considering a route to get there and what to bring. It seems they just tossed the ball up in the air on this one.  (or tossed 1000 star destroyers more like it).I would have rather watched the star wars christmas special.,0
375,"Where to even begin. I thought to myself ""they can't possibly have made a movie worse than the last one"" - boy was I surprised.This movie has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. I'm easy to please but this movie was so full of plot holes, ridiculously stupid things happening to drive the plot forward and empty characters you don't care about. I paused the movie and felt pained that there was still an hour left. If you are like me, you want to conclude the series. Why not ask your child, nephew/niece, or some other kid to make up a conclusion of the Star Wars franchise. It will be 120 minutes shorter and likely better written than this garbage. Please, it isn't even worth your bored, lazy, self-isolating time.",0
376,"Yes this contains spoilers … but it isn’t spoiling anything because this film has spoilt everything itself already. this film is so ludicrous at points … it just feels dumb.feminist fantasy … star wars - its Just weird and creepy the way Ray could not have more ultimately scraped out lukes male character from the inside and inhabited his skin like some feminist psycho stalker, literally wanting to subsume everything that was him, she in the end gets his ship, his light sabre, his name, his blessing and twenty times his powers etc and so many plot elements feel like repeats from the first three, but dialled up to 12, space battles going on whilst confronting the emperor again, this film awkwardly inhabits the shadow of the first three films with outright cloned scenes and Rays passing shot at the end of the film is to literally declare herself a Skywalker, when shes a Palpatine (a good plot twist), because I guess she married dead romeo ben - with a kiss as he sacrificed himself (a rare true male archetype moment)? and the film basically tries to slightly cover for of course … Ray & Finn being a mixed race couple romance like 5 minutes later on from Bens death, with zero mourning period? with some weird three way hug on Finns shoulder with Spanish irrelevant pilot man, who all have some white people teary absolution on Finns shoulder? but ouef The ludicrous-ness of the capstone of this 12 part saga action wise, is ridiculous, at one point there is a tribal afro women leading a charge of hairy space zonkeys on an imperial cruiser … I wish I was joking? at one point it felt the avengers cast might turn up at any moment, that imperial cruiser was just one of a CGI clone horizon to horizon wide, grid array of planet destroying imperial cruisers? too many overcooked? as per usual there some awkward race stereotyping with some desert muslim aliens doing the hobby dooby dance and Ray having some throwaway virtue signalling moment with a hijabi alien whose templating for a muslim girl. and of course all the english accented white male people are either evil or dead … pffff. Feels like the lead characters had 30 death defying impractically impossible escapes in a row - overcooked, and Finn apparently is force sensitive to, so as to enable some plot points like … that star destroyer out of hundreds is the one to attack etc. Rays force powers were just ridiculous, in training luke can barely raise a stone, Whilst Ray of course is doing self levitation yoga whilst controlling several asteroid belts of rocks in motion around herself … yawn, and the film just plain steals Romeo and Juliet at the end. The real resolution would be to pull the wizard magic from the universe by both blood lines sacrificing themselves? but Ray survives. Nearly every leader or hero in this film is of course a mary sue female kick ass character pretending to be a man, there are no genuinely actually feminine characters in this film at any point? oh and the films ego is so huge it can’t even resist revision-ing the other films and characters whilst its at it, cut to a quick flashback, Leah was a kick ass Jedi that who also beat Luke in training yada yada yada and nearly all the men involved are just idiot chumps helping out the women or following instructions … yes sir … general feminism, it does not portray the sacrificial history of the male gender in historical war at all, apart from Antifa Bens sacrifice, no no … women always did 50% or more of the war dying according to star wars. Further the whole thing at the end is the usual rose tinted watchtower magazine portrait of multiculturalism in space, soap opera with lib left earnest people charging around murdering thousands and then after, having a kumbya globalist hugging picnic, the level of psychopathic violence implied but not recognised in the films resolution is absurd. there are a few bright bits but overall its way too dialled up to 12, feels like Jerry Bruckheimer does star wars. the film kind of wears everything that is stars wars … out, which is good because I can see no reason for the franchise to return ever, after this it has nowhere to go - its dead dead and done like a very very tired donkey thats been much abused in some tacky resort. The film feels like some kind of over-drama, everything that was a one off novel thing in the original films, is repeated here ad infinitum and turned up to 12? yanking light speed back and forth to evade pursuers happens seemingly in minutes, everyones an expert on hot-wiring every ship in the universe, and ray can force battle hold and explode a star cruiser from the ground? disney and star wars are most definitely american ego sized in nature, there should have been more nuance, they pull all the possible plot levers and character reprisals you can throughout the film to elicit audience response. pfff … ouef … leaves me feeling empty, like some over inflated cake that deflates to nothing. Im so jaded …",0

378,"This a inconsistent rant. I refuse to put more effort into a review than the entirely of the director and crew for this movie put into this films story. Thinking back on my experience going to see this movie in theaters I would have to say the only joy I got from the experience was knowing as I walked out of the theater with some relief reminding myself that I used a gift card to pay for the ticket. The whole trilogy especially this final installment are so horribly written they ruin the plot for all previous star wars films. I dislike ALL star wars films now. I am in awe how horribly this movie and the two previous one were handled. How with hundreds of millions of fans who love anything star wars and many decades of history proping up the star wars franchise and lore can Disney fail so miserably and consistently I think is monumental and fills me with absolute awe. I never thought before anyone could fail so thoroughly I can scarcely believe it. I genuinely can't. Some part of me finds it more believable this **** pile of a film was done horribly on purpose. This somehow surpasses the ability to be so bad it's good. Everyone about this movie just screams a depressing level incompetent stupidity, lack of giving a **** about proper story writing, and millions of dollars dumped into flashy animation. Really the only engaging things about this movie are blatant marketing campaigns to sell toys and other merch. I mean screw it, the suspension of disbelief is impossible anyways so why not divert screen time toward inserting ads into this stupid film. I know marketing toys in star wars films go as far back as ewoks but considering the urgency for this franchise to pull itself out of it's own ass seeing its existence in this film make me want to throttle that ****-stain of a director. Disney is drowning star wars in incompetence but gotta shill toy robots with it's limited runtime. **** me running. **** everything about Disney and star wars.",0

TRoS turned the entire 40+ year saga into the Palpatine Saga. It was awful. Pacing was awful...too many worthless “fanboy” moments. I’ve been a fan since I saw Star Wars in theaters in 1977.

384,"Rise of Skywalker feels more like a celebration than a story. Disney and Lucas continue to take advantage of their fans for nostalgia and making moments not memories. The lightsaber fights were also very stagnate and my god how many new force abilities can one cram into one movie? It also showcases the fight between J.J Abrams and Rian Johnson on how they can't decide how to direct all three movies and it shows as they seem to switch back and forth between directors and completely toss away everything it set up form the previous 2 movies. One scene in particular is when Finn tries to tell Rey something important before being engulfed in quicksand. They bring up what Finn was going to say and he decides to keep it a secret. What seems like a little joke is brought 2 MORE TIMES up in the movie and every time, Finn decides not to say anything and we never learn what Finn says. Did they just forget about it? Was it J.J's idea and Rian didn't want any part in it? I don't know. But one thing for certain is that this is the worst movie of all 9 and worst trilogy of all 3.

It’s blatantly clear that the villain was shoehorned in after TLJ left the trilogy without one other than emo Kylo. And they clearly were trying to retcon TLJ out despite what JJ said.

400,"[SPOILERS] Dear #Disney, I've never before felt like leaving the cinema whilst watching #StarWars. You've almost succeeded in that accomplishment, but I guess you couldn't even pull that off. I am not a fanboy, but that was the worst film in the series by a long shot (episode 1 was much better). I couldn't find a single line of good dialogue as they just all repeated what was happening (it was clearly written by two 10 year olds and coked-up @jjabramsofficial.) I beg you Mr Abrahams quit directing as you are clearly unable to produce any original content nor anything that even resembles good story telling. The film felt like three films mashed into one with an oversized hammer, there were tons of boring unrelatable characters who I couldn't care less about, and no single setting lasted for more than 30 seconds as Abrahams abused Disney's travel budget. The constant jumps between countless places clearly showed JJ cannot do any sort of story telling that captures cinema goers attention. Mate, more is not better - did they not teach you that in film school or did you skive off? Moreover, @harrisonford_official_page how much did they pay you again or was your appearance part of the original 30 million jackpot? The bad grandpa twist, crippled Palp, was absurd just as his demise (again, cooked himself up - don't play with electricity man). Also, the lightsabers.. Oh dear, I believe I could do better with a sword if I had two broken arms. The only character not to make a splash on the screen was Jar Jar as he would probably produce better acting and dialogue than these bunch of sorry arse actors - careers over even before they had begun. Trash. Just trash. Oh, yep that's a photo of light cavalry charge atop a fleet of star destroyers... the whole film is brain dead and logic could not be found in any of the 20 planets Abrahams shoved into it. On the plus size there's a new robot which will top the bull**it toy list this year and it looks like a @dyson blowdrier. The best thing about the film was the popcorn. 2.5/10.",0
401,"""It was all for nothing"" 1. Excellent production without any meaning one would care aboutNo amount of over-production including decent acting can compensate for a poorly written story.Great story can be compelling with animated lego bricks or stick figures - it just does not work the other way.2. Too much cramped into a single movieNo amount of plot lines cramped into a two hours plus can compensate for the fact that you just do not care about any of its characters or ridiculous plot lines. The Star Wars Finale had to deal with so many characters and plot lines' loose ends that it was a genuine mission impossible (no pun intended) to make something meaningful out of it. Starting with Lucas who started the self-destruction of Star Wars with his own prequels, so hired guns can't really 'fix' the unfixable here, to be fair to JJ. This is like a full season TV show summary in two hours with time enough only for key scenes but not enough for character and plot build up and pacing necessary to build and tell the story well. 3. ""All I Want Is a Story. If You Have a Message, Send It by Western Union"" - old Hollywood adageIn a time when movies are conceived and censored at the same time to appease repressive regimes around the world any righteousness on part of the Production that western version of the film can tick all the boxes of inclusivity and social righteousness for the western world while adding similar amount of tick boxes for the other parts of the world is just nonsense. From the main character being female, to ensemble cast and some of the sidekicks and subtle or not so subtle plot sidetracks and background action. None of it matters if it is not progressing the main story and if it is a cheap add-on. Disney or producers individually are wealthy enough to make donations to whatever the cause they wish on their own time and money. Nothing wrong to be engaged with the issues of the day -- but you have to realise that you need to put your neck on the line, all the way, and not just buy few cheap message badges and put them on your collar. Few thoughts left on the 'cutting floor'....Logic has left the building here and I don't mean the trivial details but core fabric of the story that is effectively a Frankenstein monster made out of patches and leftovers of earlier unfinished threads and burden of 'legacy'.The deus ex machina gets invoked so many times that it is comical (as it is the case of earlier installments of sequel trilogy) -- anything goes and anything can happen and if not on screen it can be explained away in some stupid explanatory dialogue and therefore you don't care and mostly try to enjoy a parade of well produced visual sequences that more-less mean not a thing. You cannot just explain away your back story, or characters motivations in an expositional dialogue or characters self-reflection -- this is the tool for cheap TV. We expect better from so called A-list productions. Hence don't hire a cheap TV writers-directors who seem to know how to manipulate (cheap) cliff-hangers but do not master the art of story.Emotions in this movie seem almost artifically induced by the overblown cues of music and production and not the storyline you care about. Sort of like a laugh track in TV comedies -- sometimes it saves a mediocre joke. It has to be said that beside original trilogy (parts 4-6) things went really bad for Star Wars long, long time ago...The reboot is just following legacy of Lucas prequels with too much plot and exposition somehow substituting for lack of basic compelling story. It is somehow as Lucas (and everyone else) forgot that at its core Star Wars were based on Campbell theory of hero's journey - a simple (maybe simplistic) story of good and evil and hero's journey of self discovery.Lucas genius was to imagine this in the backdrop of groundbreaking, never before seen visual and production effects that blew everyone away. However the storyline was solid in its simplicity. It did not contain any of the clutter of the universe building or sidekick characters that were a dead weight to progression of the main story.Lucas attempted to do that in prequels - and failed.Fast forward to today, the effects and production moved on in such ways that anything can be visualised in pixel perfect quality. Anything but a badly written story -- no amount of wizardry in production can make uninteresting characters alive, confusing and meaningless plot lines interesting to watch. It is funny how the very expensive CGI that is basically expected and can be achieved through high enough budget to pay for all the high tech necesary while no amount of money can guarantee a well crafted story which is as low tech as pen and paper. Bottom line -- not worth a movie ticket. Looking forward to start anew with someone graduating from Pixar.",0

He shows no creative brilliance or wit, and this film seems to be largely the product of a checklist rather than coherent narrative. Couple this with his unforgivable pandering to whiny fanboys in trashing Johnsons work, and you have a sad, bloated conclusion to the Skywalker saga.",0
410,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It was incoherent, plot-wise, characters had no motivations or banal hallmark movie ones, ideas were introduced and ignored, or not introduced and given undue weight; it was just a bunch of stuff that happened. Easily the worst SW movie, worse even than Attack of the Clones, and that's saying something. At least that was a terrible movie that was about something. Yikes.",0
411,"Full of plot holes and ridiculous moments.  Ruins so much star wars lore just for the sake of ""cool"" or fan fictiony moments.  It's like they didn't review the material of even the force awakens or the last Jedi when making this(let alone the rest of the lore), as it contradicts so much.  It's incredibly predictable and uses every deus ex machina/McGuffin cliche the book.As a stand-a-lone movie, it would be alright, but in the context of the overall lore, it breaks everything.",0
412,"This was a tedious trudge to slog through. Where do I begin? The asinine plot that brings back old villains in a last ditch effort to salvage what little can be salvaged in this festering pile of garbage? The nonsensical dialog and performance delivered by these so-called ""actors""? The god-awful pacing that makes you feel like you are making a trek through the Milky Way in a mini-van with a deflating tire? They have RUINED Star Wars. In an effort to pander to the Woke crowd, they've gutted a beloved series and then raped it while its carcass was still fresh. To hell with all the people involved in this abhorrent excuse of a movie. Do NOT waste your time or money on this crap fest. Do not sully what little appreciation you have for the prequel and original trilogies by allowing your senses to take in this putrid Woke nonsense that cares more about boring the viewer with their agenda and narrative as opposed to entertaining the viewer. Disney and all their billions cannot save them from the crap that is the new trilogy. **** this movie, **** this trilogy, and **** every single moron involved in this sham of a project.",0

414,"If you turn off your brain and don't really care about lore, story and character development this movie is quite ok and I would perhaps rate it 6-7 of 10. But if you care about it, this movie is rather bad. It looks great and the music by Williams is great but thats about it.",0
415,"Completely jumbled mess of a movie. Palpatine's return and Rey's lineage makes zero sense. Abrams, Kathleen Kennedy, and the rest of Disney only care about putting their agenda forward as opposed to actually telling a great and cohesive story.",0
416,"Fan service: 8Actual Story: 2Rise of the Skywalker is a fast forward movie trying to reckon the ""important"" parts of The Last Jedi. While at the same time tries to give you a story.The problem that I have with this trilogy is that it make feel that now this whole SAGA is no longer a bout the Skywalker's, is but instead the Emperor Palpatine. The narrator of the trailer should be saying, Thr Emperor Palpatine is back and now his granddaughter Palpatine RISES to confront him.One way you could fix the titles of episode 8 and 9 is if you inverted those titles.   Episode 8 should be called Rise of the Skywalker  since Luke Skywalker Rise to confront his actions one more time. And episode 9 should be called Te Last Jedi. Rey ends being thr Last Jedi at the  of her chapter.Episode 7, 8 & 9 feels like a small reboot of episode  4, 5 & 6. Cause you can watch this new trilogy's without ever watching the first six movies since they eliminated that Anakin is the chosen one, theres no need to watch his six movie arcs. It's a shame that they wanted to give you a movie focused on fan service instead of give us a proper story on the Skywalker SAGA.",0

420,Это не фильм про ЗВ. Это набор сцен со спецэффектами где герои нужны чтобы перебегать из одной сцены в другую. Сопереживать некому. Рей бессмертна и неуязвима. Очередная супервумен. Сейчас в Голливуде тренд продвигать женщин но это уже перебор. Втыкают их в хорошие франшизы и убивают напрочь фильмы. Тренд что белаые мужчины плохие. Поэтому ничего умнее чем Кайло Рена не придумали)))  Толерасты.,0
421,This movie disappointed me greatly so far as I was in the theaters getting annoyed being a long geek of Star Wars and wondering what happened to the series. One main part I am still baffled at is the opening scene of Kylo ren fighting guards and slamming one to the floor with his lightsaber and just leaving a burn where he easily accidentally slashed through a tree cutting it clean in half. The transitions they used felt out of place from scene to scene and I noticed that. The whole plot felt rushed and confusing at times. Disney should have never bought the Star Wars rights.,0
422,"I didn't know Michael Bay was a ghost director for JJ Abrams! Yet another feat of storytelling, character development and world building by Michael Bay!",0
423,This film show what happened when the people running it just want the money and rush making 3 movie with no plan on idea where the story will go. They even said “ Going into this film we have no layed our plan we will just see where it goes” this makes for a lot of inconsistency in the 3 films Is was hoping for the best but the film fells half done. They tryed some vary interesting thing but the do not fallow throw with it. It is like you started something and just stoped 90% throw and started a new project and did that again and again over and over. Making the film fell choppy. Thing the people say in the movie make no sense because they did it in last film some thing the whole character seems to forget what happened in the whole last film,0
424,"This movie is an absolute disaster; the killing blow to that once magnificent galaxy far, far away. The pacing is terrible, the plot revolves around another macguffin just like the last two entries into the main Star Wars movies, it craps all over the original 6 Star Wars movies and makes them redundant, Rey is made more powerful than any Jedi or Sith who has ever lived, nothing is meaningful or has any real impact, and any consistency that once existed in the canon of Star Wars is gone. So many plot holes have been opened as a direct result of this garbage, and has done more damage to the franchise than The Last Jedi EVER did. They bank so hard on nostalgia to try to get the old fans of the Original Trilogy back, but they also, simultaneously, try to play it as safe as possible and not take any risks. The entire trilogy that Disney has made, they're just reshoots of the Original Trilogy, minus the meaningful story, lovable characters, or good writing. If you're a Star Wars fan, heed my warning, steer clear of this dumpster fire at all costs. If you're just looking for a movie that you can enjoy casually, look elsewhere; there's too much exposition for this to be enjoyable casually either.",0
425,"It was by far the worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen.  I would rather watch the tack of clones to hand times in a row,  Because at least that movie made sense. This movie was way to quick, had no good space battle, disgraced the lore, and there wasn't enough time in movie to have a one full conversation between characters. I will never watch another Disney Star Wars movie again unless people assure me that it won't ruin my view of Star Wars. I thought episode 8 was bad.  This movie said the episode I hold my beer.",0
426,"Too fast paced with no payoffs on previous story lines set in motion in the Force Awakens. This story trashes the Skywalker legacy that was put in place by the original and prequel trilogy. Plot holes are rampant throughout. Definitely feels like 2 movies in one. Pros....better than last Jedi, visuals are great, the new focal cast does get a little more development, but are limited.",0
427,"Terrible pacing. JJ Abrams can't seem to do a single shot without a camera move. The plot was quite bad, though they didn't really have anywhere to go after the last movie. It's hard to comprehend how a film with so many resources behind it could end up so disappointing. Makes me sad to be a Star Wars fan.",0
428,I have waited YEARS to watch this...more than 20 years to know what would happen...this Tv spot commercial killed my hopes and my dreams about this story. It seems like they hate SW,0
429,"This movie was horrible people! It's like George Lucas's baby has been taken off to foster care where it's being subjected to every possible type of abuse by foster parents Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams, and there is nothing he can do about it. They just make things up about the Force as they go along. There is no consistency. Where did all of this telepathy come from? Not only that but now with the force they can grab objects across the galaxy and have entire light saber battles across the galaxy! Leia could use the force this whole time but instead of training other Jedi or actually using the force they had her zip through space with no oxygen back into the safety of the ship and barely train Rey. All of this magical force stuff they made up drained Leia and Luke literally to death but it had no affect on Rey and Kylo. They didn't get drained at all. I don't see how any grown adult could actually like this movie or the last two lol. It was made for children who don't know any better. If I could give this a negative number I would. How are these untalented directors and writers getting to ruin movies like these? I'm no writer or director but I'm certain if I did my research I could at least help make a better story than this that would make sense. Hollywood should just close down or something if this is the best they can do. I kind of hate the Star Wars of today thanks to these clowns. People are only going to see this thing out of boredom and on the strength of the earlier movies not because this thing is any good at all. The gay kiss at the end was like what? I'm a gay man so I'm pro love but there was no room in this movie for any kiss because the story is garbage. Tell a good story then think about being inclusive later. Rey and Kylo's kiss was weird and awkward. They wasted Palpatine in this movie as I knew they would. I don't want to waste my whole night but in summary this movie was even worse than the last two. Fire Kathleen Kennedy, JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson and let Kevin Feige redo Star Wars!",0
430,"it's probably the worst episode of the saga... Too much fan service, and not enough script...

434,"The half star, is for the cast and crew (including photography etc) other than writing and director, who contribute their 100% of their skills and ability on not letting it sucks. And let me clarify in no shape and form I blame them. Highlights has to be given to Adam Driver, and the chemistry Daisy Ridley has with him, Grant and Gleeson (apologies if I omit someone who perform well).Now this gets out of way, let me clarify further.As a Star Wars fan, I am more than happy to give some leeway has it been mediocre or generic or cheesy. Its neither of those but a series of montages string together and barely hold together. I am not exaggerating and will freely admit I have plenty of guilty pleasure on bad movies. But 90% of the time it does not even form a semi-coherent plot. Most of the characters looks like they muttered from a quote machine with words jumbled from previous 8 movies, aimed to please all fans of different tastes. Few actors have any idea how to handle such horrid lines and I dont hold the blame to them, besides extremely bad directing.  Plot wise it violates so many fundamental principles. There are no actual stakes on hand. Rey confesses multiple times that she dread her vision seeing herself in Palpatine Throne, probably a mirror to Anakin's fears but in no shape, form or any indication this horror can be felt by general audience. None of the character has any progress or regression from TLJ development. And worst of all the film seems to understand so little about honoring previous 8 films. It so shallowly quote from previous 8 films and there are no soul to their formula.In addition they fundamentally wasted one of the generational talents, mainly Adam Driver. How this guy manage to rise his part I could not have imagine.  In short, this film feels like a massive diarrhea of multiple plot ideas and character exposition - but it came to nothing.",0
435,"I can’t believe what I just watched! The original trilogy was amazing, the prequels were good but the sequels and in particular the final episode that wraps all the story arcs up is amazingly bad. Literally bad, no joke.I won’t go into detail as I’m sure others will do that just fine, but in short over the top action (heroes galloping along the hull of a star destroyer on space horses) to Rey having healing hands (death isn’t a problem anymore apparently) or how about thousands of ships all equipped with death  star lasers, or how about the fact that to beat the fleet of Death Star ships  all you need is Lanto to take the Falcon on a joyride to gather up more ships than we’ve ever seen before, all within the space of a couple hours. And the kisses, the one with Rey and Kylo and the lesbian one to tick the political correctness box...It’s bad, I certainly won’t be going to see any more star wars movies at the cinema, certainly won’t be putting my faith in JJ Abrams again as he’s the master of remakes and am sure his future movies will be exactly like this one, rubbish rehashes of previous films in the same way this was Return of the Jedi mixed with bits of all the other movies... at least George Lucas told new stories with the prequels...Good job J J Abrams, good job...",0
437,"Incoherent mess. Scene after scene without much connection to each other. Everything was happening very convenient without much logic, time and distance was аn unfamiliar concept to the makers of this movie. Noticed a lot of recycled footage from the Force Awakens that was just looking odd and out of place. Certain character had his facial scar constantly disappearing and reappearing in different scenes which is a good indicator of the time and effort that went into making this movie - Zero. Too many copy/paste scenes from the Original trilogy with the purpose of nostalgia-bait. Music - mostly uninspired and used in the wrong places. Overall a badly bade movie and disastrous fail, filled with many errors, bad decisions, bad directing and writing.",0
438,"what a sad, depressing, disappointing, empty, soul-less, joy-less abomination of a movie. THE FORCE AWAKENS had some potential, then THE LAST JEDI took a huge dump all over that, and now THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is just an absolute mess that tries desperately to dazzle everyone with huge action, bad humor, and sickening amounts of member-berries. the Skywalker Saga began with THE PHANTOM MENACE and ended with RETURN OF THE JEDI. this Disney Trilogy is meaningless. they resurrected Palpatine just so that Mary Sue could kill him again, which makes Anakin's redemption and sacrifice completely worthless. they're trying to tell us that Rey is the ""real"" Chosen One, but she has no character, no arc, no hero's journey, no depth, nothing that makes her interesting in any way. the same goes for all the other new characters, and all the original characters have been completely ruined, reduced to failures, and killed off. i will never watch this trilogy again, it is not canon, it serves no purpose, it has no meaning, it is completely incoherent and didn't make me care about any of the characters or any of the so-called ""story"". Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams had the opportunity to make something great, but they completely failed. their trilogy is irrelevant and should not be considered part of the Skywalker Saga. all the Skywalkers were killed off, and Mary Sue Palpatine took their name and their home. it's disrespectful to the legacy of STAR WARS and needs to be erased from canon and forgotten.",0
439,"La nueva trilogía de Star Wars comenzó con un remake con los mismos trucos, pero más grandes. Pese a eso se sintió bien. La historia se pintaba interesante y los nuevos protagonistas reflejaban bien los nuevos tiempos, mientras que los antiguos estaban ahí para ser un tributo a los viejos tiempos. So far, so good.Entonces llegó la segunda entrega, el divisivo episodio 8, que hizo algo que Star Wars (al menos en las películas) no hacía hace tiempo: tomar riesgos. Los productores le dijeron adiós a JJ Abrams y trajeron a Rian Johnson, un directorazo, que hizo un trabajo decente. Su peli no solo le trajo novedades visuales a Star Wars, también llevó la historia a nuevos lugares, o al menos nuevos para las películas, porque en juegos y cómics mucho por lo que apostó Johnson ya existía y era muy aclamado.Y, sin embargo, los fanáticos la odiaron.En pocas palabras, les molestaba que el universo de heroicos jedis y malignos siths muriera y diera paso a una galaxia menos fantasiosa, con más áreas grises, donde los protagonistas no solo se alejan del pasado, sino que quieren destruirlo.Entonces los fanáticos estaban enojados, pero no tanto como los productores que no se tomaron bien que su película no fuera un rotundo éxito y que las redes se llenaran de trolls defenestrándola por haberse atrevido a alejarse de la fórmula clásica de un filme de Star Wars. ¿De qué les servía que el episodio 8, con todos los valientes riesgos tomados, fuera aclamada por la crítica si al final los fanáticos no estaban contentos? ¿Quién pone la plata finalmente?El episodio 9 de la nueva trilogía de Star Wars retorna a JJ Abrams, quien ya no puede usar el truco de hacer un remake más grande y que, además, se tiene que tragar la tarea de mandar al demonio todo lo logrado por su predecesor. Si Rian Johnson retrocedió cobardemente, en los últimos minutos de su película, renunciando a todo lo que él mismo quiso establecer, en el episodio 9 Abrams le pone pasión a enterrarlo y usar su tumba de inodoro.Ok, es válido. En todo caso, ¿tenía otra? Yo supongo que eso fue lo que le encomendaron los productores al contratarlo y, bueno, por algo también él aceptó. Pero, ¿cuál es el precio de cumplir esa tarea? Mejor dicho, ¿cuál es el resultado?El resultado es un filme complaciente, apresurado, demasiado ocupado en contradecir a su antecesor como para preocuparse en ser algo en si mismo. El episodio 9 es una mala película, es un episodio de la temporada final de Game of Thrones, es una seguidilla de momentos sacados de la nada para tratar de mantener una coherencia que se siente forzada y que intenta apoyarse en complacer todas las quejas de los fanáticos ofendidos con el episodio 8 para funcionar. Lo cual no quiere decir que la historia no tenga cierta belleza. Es ciertamente un cierre, tiene momentos emocionantes, instantes en los que te preguntas qué pasará, qué harán estos nuevos protagonistas a los que les agarraste tanto cariño. Y en este sentido es lindo notar que Star Wars, su universo, sus personajes, todavía pueden despertar algo en ti.El verdadero gran problema del episodio 9 es el pasado. No lo digo solamente por el episodio 8, sino porque los productores, los guionistas y el director están demasiado divididos en complacer a quienes no pudieron soportar un universo de Star Wars distinto al que siempre conocieron, que el resultado es un filme lleno de momentos que en lugar de sentirse emotivos te hacen poner los ojos en blanco. No por nada el gran villano de la película es una figura del pasado (que nadie sabe cómo es que retornó) que reduce la lucha de los nuevos protagonistas a una maquinación suya y nos retorna a la clásica historia del bien contra el mal. ¿Dónde está la complejidad social del episodio 8? ¿Dónde está el reto de destruir a los jedis y obligarlos a evolucionar a algo más que una orden de dogmáticos magos del espacio con el poder del Deus Ex Machina? ¿Dónde está todo lo que Rian Johnson intentó hacer para que esta saga, por fin, evolucionara en sus filmes, tal como logró evolucionar en otros medios?Pues, nada de eso está en el episodio 9, eso es seguro.Finalmente, solo quiero decir que adoro a Rey. Ha sido uno de mis personajes favoritos de Star Wars de todos los tiempos, así que intenté ver el cierre de su historia sin cinismos, ni mala predisposición. Estaba emocionado por las implicaciones sobre ella del episodio 8 que la proyectaban como una heroina novedosa, una heroina para estos tiempos, así que fue duro verla convertida en otro títere asimilado al pasado, estancada en la necesidad de fanáticos y productores de no explorar diferentes aspectos de la fantasía.Bien por ellos. Lo que es yo, seguiré viendo The Mandalorian, pero ya sin buscar una nueva esperanza en la galaxia de Star Wars, solo la espera sistemática de más de lo mismo porque solo así se gana dinero y se mantiene en silencio a los trolls.",0
440,This film was just a giant wtf. The first half seemed like a rush job on trying to appease fans with the failures of TLJ. But ended with a barely cohesive plot jumping mess. Many failures of logical thought. Many decisions made to the detriment of the overall story attempt. Surface level character development left you still not caring about the characters. Poor storytelling and it is almost painfully obvious that the creative persons were not actual star wars fans. You can tell the creative team in the Mandalorian are actual fans. I will tell my children it ended at Return of the Jedi.,0

443,"The second of the trilogy was a complete dud (1/10) and this one was marginally better (1.5/10). With lots of complete failures, corny tales, horrendous script and terrible battles, Star Wars you are lost to me (at least at the cinema). Thank goodness though there is Fallen Order.....",0
444,I love Star Wars. But this movie though is proof of how the lackluster the Disney trilogy is. It is underwhelming and it is sad that this is the last of the skywalker saga. It feels super rushed. The original cast did great. I had a moment of tearing eyes when seeing them. (C3PO was the best!) The other cast did ok. It depends on who we are talking about. Adam Driver is the best still of the new cast.  Rey is still a Mary Sue. (nothing new) The choreography in the fights are lackluster. I like the force telekinesis and how it evolves. This movie like the other two films lives off nostalgia. Jar Jar did a lot to retcon Rain's Star Wars. Thank you Jar Jar! But it does not Save this trilogy. The force is not strong with this movie and I would wait till it goes on Disney + to see it.,0

I've been a Star Wars fan for 2/3 of my life but I felt nothing when watching this movie. JJ didn't have an easy job, after Johnson threw away most of the plot threads he had left open in The Force Awakens, but he could've at least tried to write a cohesive ending, something that made sense. The fan service felt like a crutch to make up for the lack of cohesion and coherence.",0
457,This film will entertain mild fans of SW but for the fans that have been begging for this sequel trilogy will be very upset. I hated this whole trilogy honestly. The Last Jedi especially messed this whole thing up. I love The Mandalorian and I’m excited for Kenobi but whenever they mess with our old heroes it keeps going really badly. Rebels is a great show as well. Heck I even liked Solo much more than this lol.,0

The pacing of the movie was so extremely fast that you couldn't keep up with it. Every scene felt like 1-2 minutes long. Every ""emotional"" moment was swept away by dumb illogical scenarios, so many ""WTF!"" moments (in a bad way), and the movie kept adding new characters when this should be about the final moments of the characters we already knew. Had low expectations going in and felt even more disappointed...",0
459,"This movie feels completely cold and corporate, like we’re watching a checklist being completed. It’s a technical marvel but with no heart and very rushed. The story payoffs feel unearned and many things set up in the previous movies are never addressed in this one, so it feels very disjointed and messy. Rey becomes way to overpowered so there’s no sense of danger during the movie, so it becomes very boring. Adam Driver is the best thing of the whole sequel trilogy. It’s sad that this is the last chapter in te Skywalker Saga, very underwhelming. 3/10",0
460,"Nope, didn't like it at all. They used the mystical nature of the force as a trapdoor constantly, in turn ruining all the mystery behind it. There's too much ""I feel something, just trust that I read the plot and know what to do already"" moments going on, making the movie self-aware.Both new characters Zorri and Jannah are shoehorned into the story at break-neck pace to give Poe and Finn race-appropriate romantic interests, it felt forced and old-fashioned.Anyway, for those feeling down about this latest trilogy. Now more than ever is the chance to establish what YOU think Star Wars is about...Disney and it's armada of focus-groups mean nothing and hold no sway over our imaginations. Lando was right, There Are More Of Us.",0
461,"This was a huge letdown. I have a strong feling, that they-te didn't knew how to end this whole thing. They just include the Imperor without any sence.

The entire film feels like stitched together bad fan fiction. It completely invalidates past narrative and character arcs that George Lucas lovingly and painstakingly put together through 6 movies there was a unified vision. J.J.

First time a Star Wars movie didn’t leave me with happy thoughts and I instead cried about it. Positive of movie: Adam Driver.

Do not believe any facts in this or any other film. Feelings rule. Beware the shameless amount of fan candy. It is to distract the most intelligent movie going base ever from this unoriginal, insulting, painfully predictable cliche. Rey appears to have gained twenty-plus despite multiple bindings. None the less, it does not slow her from single-handedly saving the very universe she placed in peril. That other stuff is just background noise. Moral: Rey is God. Two stars solely for John Williams.",0

The other annoying part is that when you watch the movie it feels like the actor, writer and JJ never sawed the olde movies.",0
471,"What an awful movie. It's a convoluted mess - the story doesn't flow well at all. They retconned a ton of the previous movies, including the original trilogy in awful ways. Rey is still a Mary Sue who's the ""Bestest ever"" at everything. One of the most boring characters I've ever seen in a movie. While I applaud their efforts to try to ""fix"" what The Last Jedi (Episode 8) broke (which was pretty much everything), it was too tall an order. Awful story, awful mechanics, bad retconning changes to the lore. It's just a mess. As far as I'm concerned, Episodes 7-9 are non-canon because they just completely ruin the series. Star Wars is dead at this point unless Disney makes some major changes at the top, removes these 3 movies from canon, and re-does a lot of it.",0

If you thought 'The Last Jedi' did a bad job following up 'The Force Awakens', then you're in for an even bigger shock this time around. In Abrams/Terrio's 'The Rise of Skywalker', there is absolutely no respect for the film that directly preceded it, in service of sprinting at breakneck speed towards a conclusion that, on paper, sounds like a twelve-year-old wrote it as a fan-fic and thought it was edgy and cool. This is no way to end a franchise. If you've seen TLJ and liked it, stop there. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. Write your own ending, because this one's for the birds.",0
473,"This is a mess of a film that attempts to stand on the shoulders of the previous films but instead, weakens them. Pretty pictures don't make up for lazy storytelling and personally, I'm glad this mess of a series is done. Don't waste your time.",0
474,"I was so disappointed leaving the theater. The pacing of the movie was a mess and there's just so many plot holes and things that don't make any sense. I feel like they deliberately made the story pace so fast so you couldn't stop and think about what was going on and realize it doesn't make sense. The time frame of events, the new force powers, the fight, the ending! They should have spent more time coming up with a story that made sense before they even released The Force Awakens. They had no idea where they were going with the story and hoped they'd find there way by the end but this is a terrible way to end the saga. Don't waste your time watching it in theaters, just wait for it to come out with a directors cut so everything they had to cut to make this nauseating mess is put back in.",0
475,"So this movie earns 3 stars, based on Adam Driver's onscreen performance.  Suggestions for next time.  Try writing a script first.  If this script reads anything like this crap, throw it away, and start again.  What a rushed messs.",0
476,"TL;DR A pandering, soggy, feminist, non-sensical, critic pleasing disappointment of a solid series.As a stand alone movie, detached from reality, broken away from anything else Star Wars and that had 200 million dollars dumped into it, it's okay. As the 9th installment that was supposed to shine as the apex of the grand adventure that George started spanning several generations with an established canon and formula, Disney and Kennedy spit in our faces and ruined what was going to be an amazing series for the past several years. Physically going to George Lucas and throwing away his creative instruction for his own series over Disney money only further incinerated the dumpster fire that was started with the constant bickering and firing of directors and producers. IX made VII and VIII make even less sense, and throws away so much of what was already established as canon. IX does a good job on trying to tie the loose knots that is killing off all male roles, making the sith (Kilo) look like an unconfident **** sorry excuses for character development, worse romance than Twilight had, and story development time wasting. This movie feels like it was rushed, poorly executed, and molded perfectly to please critics and leave the entire body of fans in the gutter. IX is a perfect example of pandering, you can see that divide perfectly between the people and the critics. 6 year old me is still shaking his head over this poor development that was established between Lucas Art's movies, and what was established in VII. I created an account just to convey this disappointment. This isn't the Star Wars we know, this is Disney's portrayal of what they wanted Star Wars to be.",0
477,I wish I could say this movie worked for me. ITS A SIMPLE FAIL THIS MOVIE. Yes it looks good and the actors are pretty damn convincing.  But the story is so filled with plot holes. I cant stand by and let Disney pump movies out like this for my childeren. I JUST NEED TO TELL YOU DISNEY YOU **** THIS UP.,0
478,"I was not expecting anything from Disney and, as usual, they did not disappoint.The movie has no plot at all, it's a random sequence of actions scenes stitched together.It's basically a 3 hours long toys commercial. Made for young kids to buy toys (like the new droid), there's no movie here.They waste more time in showing a female-female kiss than to explain how a dead Sith Lord came back to life. They could have easily connected this to what Palpatine told Anakin in the Prequel trilogy, but they did not, for some reason...OH WAIT! STORMTROOPERS ARE FEMALE NOW! So it's a five star movie, of course!",0
479,"Disney has no understanding of the ""Hero's Journey"" anymore.I'm so tired of what Star Wars has become. Not angry, just tired.Rushed plot, horrible pacing, nonsensical reveals, bland characters...It's a perfect example of style over substance, but without any payoff.Just like TLJ, there is no RISK or CONSEQUENCE, nothing makes SENSE.Now all the OG actors are either too old, or dead. Disney botched everything.At this point, i'm going back to the EU, where Disney can't reach.Kathleen Kennedy, Bob Iger, Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams can go to hell.",0
480,"Blank characters, stupid plot, unneeded macguffines, disgrace of the original trilogy",0
481,As complex as the plot of my 12 year old sister's fan fiction:It is me (blank)(blank) Skywalker,0
482,Like GoT this series final episodes destroys everything about the previous good ones. Save your money.,0
483,Th Rise of Skywalker is the worst movie of the entire Star Wars’s saga. Ryan Johnson had created an authorial film with the experiment of the last Jedi while J.J Abrams now switch to fan made film with jumble style that destroys almost every single character of the film. The script is so embarrassing that it seems impossible that no one noticed it. Great actors seem amateur. The spiritual tradition of the saga collapse in favour of continuous tributes. Action in two scenes is enjoyable but path to arrive to it is so chaotic that this scenes become an end in themselves. In average I agree with the critics but this time my judgement is more negative.,0
485,This movie is painfully boring and has a story that makes no sense. And it's clear this series didnt have a plan as this movie tries to correct the wrongs of the last movie. No cohesion from film to film it feels like the emperor was thrown in as a last ditch effort. And this films story telling is awful it's a constant find one thing that leads to another and another,0
486,"There are no memorable moments in this movie, besides perhaps the score. Don't waste your money, spend it on better things because I assure you, there are better ways to spend your time than to watch this dumpster of a movie.",0
488,"I saw many things happen very rapidly and all at once on the screen, but it's amazing that I didn't feel much of anything from them. The first half of the movie was basically like watching someone play a fetch quest in a video game after they've entered godmode cheats. Rey's overpoweredness is even worse in this movie, with her suddenly able to do insane things that we haven't seen ever before. The side effect of this is that every moment of her on screen is devoid of tension, because she is guaranteed to win in spectacular fashion. It is also jam packed with memberberries.The movie completely invalidates and ruins the achievements and payoffs of the first six movies, and the movie doesn't offer any explanation on why this happened. It was infuriating how they canceled out everything that happened in Return of the Jedi, and then proceeded to remake it during the second half of the movie.This whole trilogy needed an outline and game plan. It is an incoherent mess devoid of good storytelling elements.",0
489,"As a fan i was totally disappointed and I won’t go into that obviously but looking at this without any preconceptions; the story was weak, acting and dialogue poor and the film looked rush. The only reason I give it a three is the visuals and music. This could of been an amazing trilogy. Actually all 3 films are bad in my opinion. Is it the lack of; understanding and experience, not having the right people involved or is it the direction Lucas and Disney have gone, I don’t knowThe only positive to come from all this is that it makes me really appreciate the OT and PT even more",0
490,Palpatine is alive? Don't know how. Finn loves 3 different girls? Don't know how. Horses in the space? Don't know how. Ruining all star wars's canon? Don't know how. See this film? Don't know why.,0
491,The movie is one of the worst in the saga but slightly better than Last Jedi. Totally undoes everything done in the previous trilogies and with the story of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader and all the heroes of the OT did. Total slap in the face to George Lucas vision and story!,0
492,"It's by far the worst Star Wars movie Disney has made. It's dazzlingly bad. From the action, to the pacing, to the editing, to the writing, it's awful. Disrespectful to the OT, disrespectful to its own trilogy. A rushed, cobbled together mess of contrived plot wrap ups, miraculous fixes, convenient arrivals, and a million sloppy reveals. All wrapped up in a needlessly contrived return of Palpatine. People aren't even in character for most of it. I'm legitimately stunned by how bad this is. It is far worse than The Last Jedi, it is worse than The Force Awakens. **** I think it's worse than Solo, have to let that marinate. I'm totally stunned.",0
493,This moving is so boring and flimsy you have to ask did the Disney exec not come to the same conclusion or is it just the money they are interested in.Jj started the rot in force awakens rian continued with the rot in the last Jedi And jj just gave up in the rise of sky walkerIf they wanted to move away from the original trilogy then they should have filmed standalone movies not destroy the canon,0
494,Pacing issues. This film should have been in two parts or attempted less. All conflicts except the initial conflict are resolved within minutes of their introduction. Sacrifices made by characters turn out to not be sacrifices at all. Everyone shows up where they need to be with no explanation. Entire film edited like that one scene in Bohemian Rhapsody with the exception of a few extended VFX shots or longer bits of dialogue.,0
495,What were Disney and Lucasfilm thinking? Too many canon breaking plot-holes to count. It's embarrassing.,0
496,"I have no idea what I just watched. The most haphazard assemblage of random scenes, all of which seem to fall in one (or more) of these categories, without actually following any kind of plot:- awkwardly retconning the mess made by TLJ- shameless fanservice- plot-irrelevant visual spectacle",0
497,"In terms of plot, lore and even logic, The Rise of the Skywalker is the worst in the trilogy, which is really saying a lot. The one thing that makes it more tolerable than the other two is that it's not a complete bore.Make no mistake, the plot is beyond stupid and JJ Abrams, as always, has no original idea and recycles stuff from the old movies. And finally, after having many videogames trying to be like movies, we have a movie that tries to have the plot of a videogame. Instead of having a normal 3 Act structure like any competently made film, the Story of the Rise of the Skywalker is structured like that of a videogame. So inthe first level you go to find the McGuffin, the second level you learn more about the McGuffin, third level is just there to prolong the gameplay, in the fourth you are finally reminded what the plot is and in the fifth you go to fight the final boss.As far as continuity and lore goes, this movie is a travesty. I gues JJ just said **** It"" and threw everything in order to make it more epic: Star Destroyers that each has a Death Star cannon, Palpatine can now take out a whole fleet with his lightning, people can be healed and brought back from the death(poor Anakin, if only he knew), etc. But my favorite has to be the cavalry charge on the top of a Star Destroyer, at least once in my life I would like to have whatever JJ was having when he wrote that.All this stupidity makes it at least something to look at, simillar to a dumbster fire, unlike the Last Jedi which put me to sleep. Not to mention that the characters are almost likeable now and they do have some chemistry. Rey is still a Marry Sue but she finally has an arc. Poe is a pretty good character when he is not having his priviledge constantly checked by older women and his bromance with Finn is still entertaining. Speaking of Finn however, he is still useless. In the Force Awakens he was the character with the most potential but here, once again, he doesn't do anything, other than maybe being cucked by Lando at the end. As for Palpatine, he is kinda boring now since he doesn't ham it up like in the old movies. Still his Fortress and Cult were kind of cool, so props to them for the first OT character they didn't completelly ruin.Rise of Skywalker is not what killed the franchise, it's just the final nail in coffin of a trilogy that was dead on arrival. But like Palpatine's corpse, Disney will bring it back again and again until it stops making them money.",0
498,"Bringing in the emperor, sucking life out of Rey and kylo to regenerate his in Ep. VI burned ass, just to be f*cked Up minutes later by Rey in the same manner he was already defeated by windu and Vader for TWO TIMES is the worst Ending to a 9 movies saga I could have ever imagined. Poor George Lucas, - You destroyed his life's work and my childhood",0
499,I feel insulted. I can't believe how bad the writing and the performances are. Or the plot. The Force is strong in this movie: everything feels forced.,0
500,"Yet another formula driven narrative. Very rushed.  So many inconsistencies.  It just felt like they made a list when brainstorming at the writers table, and proceeded to check off the items on their list.  I didn't feel connected to any characters, other than maybe Chewbacca.  I know a lot of people who don't want to get connected to fictional characters or stories and they live for great CGI and visual effects and not much more will probably enjoy the film.   Hollywood has learned how to make their billions from that very audience by following a very precise formula.  If it weren't for The Mandalorian I would be giving up on any hopes of future Star Wars projects.  Not really angry about it, as it is what it is.  I am just disappointed as it could have been so much more.  I remember buying the original Star Wars scripts back in 1999 and wondering, wow....I wonder what Luke Skywalker does next....what will become of the Jedi Order?  I cant' say finding out was really worth the wait.",0
501,"It’s difficult to imagine a more disappointing end to this beloved saga. The whole Palpatine thing was so contrived and painful to watch. While I did not like TLJ I felt JJ should not have retconned the film. Apparently the force is just magic pixy dust that can make you fly, heal a lightsaber wound, and resurrect the dead? When the hero is all-powerful, and has literally no limitations, the audience disengages.",0
502,"I laughed so hard while watching this. Its the best Unintentional comedy I've ever seen. It completely destroys Episodes 1-6 and renders them pointless. It completely Kills Star Wars. I'm not even mad any more that they have completely killed this franchise any more. I just have to laugh now. Daisy Ridley can not act. Her only expression is standing there like a moron with her mouth gapping open and her eyes bugging out of her head. Rey is a awful character and this movie does nothing to make her any better. The story in this is basically non existent. Its get the thing go kill Palpatine and roll credits. This movie just destroys star wars cannon by having force ghosts grabbing light sabers. moronic force powers. Luke , Han, Lea are all dead and were made a bunch of losers and died like idiots. Star Wars is truly dead and Killed by Jar Jar Abrams, Rain Johnson, Kathlean Kennady , and Bob Iger. Congradulations Disney on brutaly murdering a franchise. LOL theres nothing you can do but just laugh at it all.",0
503,"Just a Garbage! I can't believe what happened to my favorite franchise. Am I awake or it's only a damn nightmare?! Movie is full of silly plot twists and bad actings. Damn Kathleen Kennedy, Damn her. She is responsible for this piece of sh*t.",0
504,"I can't believe they've ruined Star Wars saga with this movie. Basically a low tier fan fiction written by couple of 12 years old. At least episode 8 had some logic in the plot, this one it's just garbage",0

506,Полный отстой. Тупая с самого начала новая трилогия завершилась убогим образом.,0
507,"The basic problem here is that this trilogy is completely pointless apart from the fact that it’s a way for Disney to print  money.   These 3 movies and probably a dozen more were already greenlit with no requirement of a good or even coherent story.   At this point, there’s no reason to spend the time trying to figure out what they were thinking with the story.   The movie is doing what it was created to do.   Farming Star Wars fans for hundreds of millions of dollars every couple years.  Consume product.  Get excited for the next product.",0
510,"This film.had a awesome first half. It was messy and fast but it was fun and the first time we saw the new heros working together as a group. The second half was a total **** show that was not at all built up by the previous movies. All the actions with palpatine and Ray were unearned, Han coming back as a force ghost was silly. The fcat that Anakin didnt come back to help Ben was a waste of potential,  and the fact that it was retuen of the jedi two electric boogaloo was sad. JJ cant male a orginal idea, just rehash old one's.",0

512,"I watched this movie with VERY low expectations ater reading the leaks. I was going to recap the entire film but that would've been WAY TOO LONG. Don't get me wrong, there are genuinely good moments and few scenes that I liked, such as the C3PO and R2D2 scene, the scene where Chewbacca and Lando reunited. I still REALLY had a tiny bit of hope after the final trailer got me anticipating and hyping this movie but the hope was instantaneously destroyed when the opening crawl started.",0
513,I wish I could give this piece of garbage less than zero. Rey Palpatine will NEVER be loved by the true fans. Fire Kennedy now!,0
514,"they just piss on the fans, so many plot holes that you might swell just look at a swish cheese for two and a half hours.",0
515,"And so the saga ended not with a bang, but a whimper. This is what happens when your have no clear direction for a trilogy. And have a writing team who are all so bad that it takes endless test audiences, over and over again, to fix it back up to being watchable. And even with all that work testing it out; they can barely get the movie back to 'middling'.",0
516,"The circle is now complete. When I saw Return of the Jedi it was a fan respect earner now Star Wars is a disaster. This garbage completes what began in TFA. What happened to C3P0, the Rey/Kylo ""rematch"" and (everyone knows this by now so it's not a spoiler) Emperor Palpatine. The epic failure of an epic saga makes me sad. The ending scene made me cringe and shake my head. Way to go Disney.",0
517,"Those 3 points are for the VFX-artists and setdesigners/propmakers who worked their ass off to get this movie made, and to John Williams, who is always the best part of any Star Wars film.This movie is absolute garbage. They can't help themselves making the same movie over and over again, until you can hardly call it a movie anymore. For me this one ruined 7 and 8 as it reveals that there was no plan, roadmap or anything to steer this trilogy. This trilogy is basically the Disney Improvisation show, especially this movie.They have so much to do in this film, so much to develop. But what do they do? They shove in a bunch of new PC characters, locations and pointless action scenes. It is honestly insulting, the way Rise of Skywalker treats it's audience.It is filled with plot devices, plot holes, deus ex machina's and false deaths.I was hoping that they would reawaken my love for star wars but they buried it for good. I went in with an open mind, not nit-picking at all, and still this move made me angry.I always ridiculed the prequels and thought it was rather funny, the way they threw out George Lucas' concepts. But now I'm genuinely upset that we never got to see what his vision was. The man who made the originals, not the man who just copies them.",0

521,"Unimaginative, predictable, silly in its wokeness, makes no sense plot-wise, disrespects the previous trilogies, while FORGETTING its rules and certain events - thus creating plot holes that are impossible to explain. Also disrespects Luke Skywalker once AGAIN by making him look like a loser. I just... I can't... I just can't anymore. Regime change please. Favreau/Filoni of The Mandalorian, please take charge!

524,"JJ tried to salvage what he could obviously. But the cautionary tale ""too many cooks spoils the food"" is again in full force here. Dear Ryan J. and Kathleen K. did unrepairable damage. So Ep. IX ""The Rise of Frankensteinian Movie"" is simply just that - 50-60% of it's entire length is servicable at best. The rest is stiched up parts from many different cuts, reshoots, old parts from previous movies. Which results in this piss poor result. I still IMO say - good work JJ, but you know what dear Dr. Mccoy said - ""It's dead Jim""",0
525,"Just bad. Actors > great job. Story consistency, logic > just bad day.Too much cramped into a single movie.",0
526,"The Rise of Skywalker confirms that Disney had no overarching plan when they began the sequel trilogy. Episodes 7-9 are utterly pointless, and they undermine the conclusion of Return of the Jedi and the story arc of Anakin Skywalker.There are many things one could nit-pick about The Rise of Skywalker, and that's because it entirely contrived nonsense trying to appease fans after The Last Jedi wrote the series into a corner.",0
527,"If this movie would be solely standing for itself, I would give it a 6/10. The story is not overwhelming, but at least entertaining. The story develops to quick, the action scenes are good, there are some funny parts and some sad ones, although because of the quick story developing they never really shake you or give you time to think. It's a mediocre movie with great actors and some moments.  But it's a star wars movie. The third installment of a trilogy. A sequel to other movies with a very well elaborated plot and character history. If you compare it to (at least) the last two movies it's redundant. Some main characters are completely unnecessary for the whole plot line, others show a development you will definitely not understand and others seem to exist just to fit with the nostalgic fanbase.Compared to the prequels this movie and in particular the whole sequel trilogy is bad. Don't get me wrong. This movie and all other movies from the sequel trilogy (even Last Jedi) are very well made. However, you cannot judge a movie only by its production value. From a plot point it's not good, it's chaotic and there's no coherence. You have to judge this movie in comparison to the last two movies and in the end you will give it a 3/10.",0
528,"Худший фильм из всей франшизы, обесценивший события оригинальной трилогии! Сюжета так такового нет, монтаж сумбурный. В первой трети фильма события развиваются слишком быстро, как будто смотришь на перемотке. Игра главных героев абсолютно не вызывает ни капли сопереживания, особенно разочаровали дуэли на световых мечах, которые похожи на дуэль палками в любом детском садике! Единственное, за что фильму ""спасибо!"" - это за красивые битвы на космических кораблях, и то из-за отвратительного монтажа ощущается, что при пост-продакшине вырезали множество сцен, которых не хватает в этих эпизодах!",0
529,"This movie had no redeeming qualities at all. It was part Indiana Jones, part Harry Potter, part LOTR, and part SW--not SW. There were many plot points to the movie and yet all of them were bad.I, or maybe the internet, thought Rey was related to Palpatine after TFA. To see that come true was just terrible especially after the revelation that Rey wasn't related to anyone. The dialogue was often worse than the worst parts of the prequel trilogy. You could tell the actors were trying their hardest not to cringe at the dialogue at times. I really feel sorry for Ian McDermed whose last performance in ROTS was just incredible. It was the definitive showoff for the character. One particular plot point that I really thought was strange was that Lando and Luke searched unsuccessfully for the sith artifact/ship of the one guy a long time ago, and yet Rey and the gang find it by accident in a matter of minutes. Luke is connected to the force. Wouldn't he be able to tell if something was give off dark side energy? That was the point the movie first made me cringe. The next was Rey stopping the frigate with the force and then blowing it up with lightning. The worse part was that they made it seem like she killed Chewie for about five minutes. If Chewie is to die even in a fake out death, he deserves a way better death than something ridiculous like that. The movie does reverse other parts of The Last Jedi like Luke having respect for the Jedi again, Rose's inclusion as a main character, and Kylo Ren being all encumbered with being evil. One aspect it does not reverse is the force connection between Rey and Kylo which Snoke created. How is it still around if Snoke is dead? It doesn't matter, and it's used around 10 times here and in a more extreme way than before. Rey and Ren have lightsaber duels through the force portal when before they could barely touch their hands together. The Last Jedi hinted at letting the past die, but here it's all about reliving the past.I guess the only compliment I can give the movie is the sets and locales were really interesting.  The sith ghost stadium was pretty cool looking as well. If this had been used in some other way in the plot, it would have made more sense.",0
530,"It’s painfully obvious that Disney didn’t have a great (or at least good) plan set out for its trilogy. Being. Fan for almost 30 years, it pains me to see the wat the franchise is being handled.

I just watched it, and I can’t recall anything particularly noteworthy.Storywise, this was just a lot of why would you even go there? The Emperor’s return is introduced in the opening crawl. The start is choppy and disjointed as all hell. Rey gives up her lightsaber and get’s it back in literally under 6 minutes.",0
535,"Too backward-looking, particularly its misguided attempt to correct perceived mistakes from the previous episode. Instead of challenging the audience, it went running in the opposite direction. It's a remarkable feat to be visually stunning but completely unsatisfying, but this movie managed to achieve that dubious distinction.",0
537,"This will gross a billion because it is Star Wars. Had Disney CREATED a good film, it would have made FIVE billion. Starting off okay, it descends into ""social justice"" cringe (the audience groaned repeatedly). It is unimaginative, cutesy, confused, derivative and disrespects the original trilogy. Awesome production values wasted on a 50 cent script. Saw it opening day out of curiosity. I will not waste my time on a second viewing. Thank you Kathleen Kennedy.",0
538,"A narrative abortion plagued by nonsensical plot decisions and the pacing of a runaway train. Visually stunning, but I have strong suspicion it would more easily be enjoyed on mute. Leaves so many unanswered questions as to barely be considered a conclusion for the Disney sequel trilogy, and does great harm and disservice to the stories previously told in this awe-inspiring universe. Laudable performances by Driver and Boyega don't do enough to overcome the surrounding blandness.",0
539,"After The Last Jedi, a movie with strong themes, direction, and beautiful cinematography I expected more. Star Wars is known for its clear themes, distinct character focus, and mythical storytelling. With The Rise of Skywalker I felt as if I were watching a Marvel movie spectacle - and a bad one at that. Poor editing, incoherent plot lines, and some plot threads brought up only to be dropped and unheard of again, it felt like a schizophrenic departure from its two predecessors. I came out of the theater asking myself, ""What was the theme? What was the point?"" The entire movie, scene by scene, seemed to be screaming ""THIS IS NOT THE LAST JEDI."" Rather than focusing on a good film with cohesive themes and an intelligible plot, this film seemed to aim for pandering to its fan base. It couldn't even be complimented on its cinematography, wit, or character. All around disappointing and vapid film aimed to provide spectacle and no depth.",0
540,"God the scenario was so bad... everyone dies and comes back just like that, because hey, it's the force!And that ending... What a lack of imagination. It was so absurd that everyone laughed at the movie theater.",0
541,"If you're looking for action-packed scenes, with a bunch of explosions, nostalgia, and lightsaber duels then you will enjoy this movie. However, If you care about consistency in the saga, set lore and the previous two trilogies then you will be extremely disappointed. In short, Ray is Jesus and no one can stop her.",0
542,"This movie is a mess.Let's start from the beginning. First they come outright that Palpatine is back, never actually being dead and Snoke was actually Palpatines puppet or something. Second Rey is a Jedi Master now, being trained by Lea since she is a Jedi Master herself being capable to defeat Luke but she stopped because reasons, and what fun they do a Ryan Luke to her, she basically died making a phone call, because that was a good idea from the Last Jedi.Third the constant jumping between the planets with the same things happening: They come to a planet they have to find the plot device, Rey has visions of Ren, they battle via the force calls, something goes wrong but somehow they make it work. Rinse and repeat.Oh and force users can teleport items and by the looks of it also the users themselves.Rey is apparently a Palpatine thus making the talk that her parents are nobodies into random idiotic line.Honestly right now I'm dumbstruck right now, I'm so disappointed that I'm close to angry. They at least could have turned Rey into a bad guy considering it would have been a better ending honestly but no, they toy with a lot of good ideas but didn't have the balls to do it instead they go the safe route.",0
543,"There is a way to enjoy this movie. Turn your brain completely off and forget that it is a Star Wars movie and anything that came before it.If you don't, well, the SFX are good. That's the good part. The rest is pretty bad. Starting for *non spoiler* that the Emperor is alive despite Vader killing him and then the Death Star II exploding. If the guy that makes the movies doesn't even know what happened before them, you can't expect much. This movie has plotholes on top of plotholes (43 according to shadiversity, I didn't count, way too many), and breaks the lore in every imaginable way. And the force is used as a magic box to do anything that the plot needs to advance to the inevitable end of Rey fighting (and beating) Palpatine.",0
544,"It's real bad. Looks like there's one more terrible star war. It's offensively overstuffed and boring. With enough 'plot' to fill all the prequels, it features more planets and locations that you don't know or care about, it features so many ships and medium level special effects that they all blend together. The acting is bad, but that's par for the course. The script is easily high school drama club level, and apes lines from all previous films. It's a greatest hits of Star Wars, but it forgot the songs we actually freaking like. The redemption arc is forced. The ultimate villain arc is forced. The final battles are super forced. The understanding of the Force is turned into how we played make-believe as kids - the Force could do whatever we wanted whenever we wanted. JJ Abrams and Disney have finally done what I expected them to do to Star Wars. Great work you tepid losers.",0
545,"story was a complete mess lacking any direction. felt like 7 different plots happening in one all tornadoing in on themselves. there was a lot of fan service i didn't care for. too much nostalgia channeling. too many scenes where characters would slowly say 2 sentences and stare at one another dramatically but without any actual drama happening. many plot devices seemed shoe-horned in. pacing was terrible. felt like a marvel movie. i predicted the ""twists"" before this movie was even announced (rey's identity). the movie didn't resolve a lot of things brought up in previous films that seemed like they were only brought up in those films to be resolved in later movies. hell, this movie did that. where it brings something up and doesn't resolve it. what was the point?? because this movie instantly solves any shocking moments in the movie, there's no tension whatsoever. random ""fetch quest"" and ""side quest"" arcs that felt pointless. won't watch again. completely underwhelming.",0
546,"The worst part of SW. Bad dialogs, bad motivation, they rape my childhood without any apologies",0
547,The scenario exists thank to a laugh in the trailerThanks Disney for this ****,0
548,"This is by far the worst of the recent Star Wars movies. My theory is that they knew what ending they wanted and worked out the script backwards from there. It is boring, repetitive and by the end purely nonsensical. You have to groan in disbelief when there is yet another revelation that a major character is related to the iconic originals. The space battle special effects are mediocre at best. Even Solo was better than this. Daisy Ridley is fine as Rey but some of the things she has to do are ludicrous. I think it is time for Kathleen Kennedy to step down from overseeing this franchise. The last few years have been a mess. There is always talk of getting a visionary scriptwriter and/or director to do something different but then the fear sets in and there is a retreat - and the end result is something that feels like it was created by a committee. I was looking forward to seeing this movie but the end result is a major disappointment. This is a botch.",0
549,It's hard to say anything positive about the movie as SW fan. I'm glad it's over and I didn't put a penny into Disney's pocket for this performance.,0
550,"I for one really like JJ's TFA, but enjoyed the new direction Johnson took TLJ even more. I thought it did Luke a real service in giving him an arc. The way that ROS tried to actively undermine its predecessor bothered me. I almost wanted to get up and say: JJ, Johnson, get an f***ing room and sort this sh*t out as men, but don't treat us to your creative differences by making a mess of a wonderful franchise. The rough treatment Rose and other characters gets is just a small part. It just all feels like an alt-universe after TLJ. What bothered me most was that the message from TLJ, that anyone can rise, was a way more inclusive one that the one now...you gotta be a Skywalker or a Palpatine. Any choices in that movie were inconsequential. Chewie dead? For 2 minutes. C3PO brain-dead...all of 5 minutes. Also, what would Rey's parents think of her name choice in light of their sacrifice? The end imho was just a poorer copy of the Avengers. 5 minutes of Falcon time and suddenly there is a fleet? What did they offer them, what they didn't offer them on Craite? Free tickets to Lana del Rey? And then instead of a glorious moment of slowly having ""the people's army"" drop out of Hyperspace, we get a moment of BOOM, there it is...and over. What?This is a poor ending. They should have left it at TLJ or have ONE of the two visions play out, rather than compete and make it a luke-warm nothing (pun intended). I'll now go back and rewatch the trailer 10 more times, because THAT thing gives me the goosebumps the movie didn't (and its glorious soundtrack did NOT even figure into the final battle....) sigh...",0
551,"Not as insulting as Ep 8, but not making any more sense either. Nullifies Anakin’s sacrifice and the ending of Ep 6, great, thanks Disney! Also makes it absolutely clear now that Disney didn’t have a plan for the trilogy‘s story arc... how is that even possible?!",0
552,Some parts made me feel like the film maker thinks the audience is stupid. Falling through quick sand into a tunnel but the sand doesn’t come with you? And just happening to land on top of the mcguffin. Take the mcguffin to a place  and land in the perfect spot to use it with out know how to use it before landing. This movie is supposed to cap the saga but the whole sequel trilogy there was no plan and it is very obvious.,0
553,"Holy Lord this was bad. This was such a bad, bad, bad film. It was terrible.I'll start with the only 3 things I liked - C3PO, Han's scene, and the final shot, which I thought was beautiful and echoed A New Hope very nicely.Everything else was remarkably bad. Nothing made sense. Who had what power, how did they have it, why would they lose it if they did this or that, why would they gain it if they did this, or if they link up with whoever...who what where when why. Just a complete screenwriting fart on screen.Palpatine...ok. No explanation for how he survived, how he did anything at all he said he did, how he was Ray's grandfather, how did he know some things, but did not know other obvious ones...why was there 0 build up to him from the first two movies...really everything that happened on screen was just a horribly stupid screenwriting fart. They didn't plan the story, they didn't collaborate properly, this was basically a ""pick up from the last sentence"" creative writing exercise. And they can do it because they are a billion dollar franchise and know people will see the movie no matter how embarrassing the screenwriting and the planning is.I'm just embarrassed for the legacy of the franchise and the talent of the actors who were stuck in a terrible script.The only two characters that mattered in any way were Rey and Kylo/Ben. But the conclusion to their story was just horribly unsatisfying. After all this and they deliver a bland, see it coming from the first scene of A Force Awakens conclusion of Kylo sacrificing himself to save Rey. Quick kiss without addressing what if anything it means. Just frustrating.Easily the worst Star Wars movie, and I think it is absolutely insane if anyone prefers the sequel trilogy to the prequel one after this let down.",0
554,"Pretty entertaining when you just watch it and turn your brain off, but the second the movie ends and you start to really think about each plot point and what happened, everything start to fall apart; more questions end up being asked than answered. Its clear the trilogy had absolutely no plan at all, and this is the collapse of that. Not exactly what you want from a final movie in a trilogy.",0
555,"Better than the disaster thst was last jedi. Though in trying to correct course, the filmakers oversteered. Storyline was all over the place. Pacing was completely off. Characters underdeveloped, and consistently making poor decisions. Broke the conventions/rules of the previous films for no logical reason. This is what happens when you write a trilogy on the go. Shame .",0

564,"Coming from an amazing Space Epic Opera as the original trilogy was, these movies really suck...yes great special effects , amazing actors , incredible production design..and yet it is lame!  It is so sad to see so much potential go to waste.",0
565,This movie is so broken (mainly because of the movie before it) that it breaks all the rules the previous movies have established. Fake character development that falls so flat makes this movie so uninteresting. This last trilogy is a dumpster fire. Congratulations Disney Trilogy you have ruined the six stories right before it.,0
566,"I have no idea how a ""respectable"" movie studio can make a trilogy of films without actually doing anything remarkable when it comes to the main story. The first movie relied on nostalgia, and it's kinda logical, to lure us back in. The second one effectively pissed on the first one and actually tried to go to a different direction, it's the only one that tries to be original. Then this movie completely ignores both of those movies and tries to sell an awfully cheap story as ""the end of the saga"" that nobody asked for. I read a ""scenario leak"" on reddit a couple of months ago, and I have to say that that story was much better than the one I actually saw in the movie theater. So, basically, a random guy wrote a better scenario than these guys did. The Last Jedi is the least bad movie in this trilogy, 35% of the movie was pure crap, but I admire the bravery to try something else. The Rise of Skywalker will be remembered as an example of what forcing a series of films without any plan or vision whatsoever looks like.I though I was being harsh, but I haven't yet met a person who saw this movie and liked it.",0
567,"First Abrams soft-reboots the Star Wars universe, undoing all of our heroes' accomplishments and turning them into old failures who give up and die. Then he leaves no notes for poor Rian Johnson to follow, so Rian just says ""screw it"" and makes a giant middle finger to the fans, the justifiably hated Last Jedi. Then Abrams comes back and tries to duct-tape together what's left of this mess, only to fail spectacularly by destroying all of the Skywalker saga and George Lucas's vision even further. Bravo, Disney. Every time I think things can't get any worse for Star Wars, you've managed to pull it off. Why do you keep doing this? To quote the Simpsons, ""Stop! Stop, he's already dead...""",0
568,"Gotta day, this movie was an improvement from the last Jedi, but it was not a good Star Wars movie. The whole movie was incredibly rushed through, no explanations for anything including rey’s force powers or training, we got a small look into leia’s jedi history and instead of going with legends we go with a “nah just not feeling it” backstory? This movie could have been done a lot better had it just taken the time to end it with a true rise of a skywalker, not the rise of some Mary Sue that doesn’t have any real training",0
569,"Every time the characters encounter a problem, the solution is magically given to them. They hardly have to exert themselves. This feels like a fanfic that was created by someone who watched the original trilogy two times and thought they could make something Star Wars. Well, there is no George Lucas in this, there is no heart in this, and they took every shortcut in the book.If this were a D&D campaign, the characters rolled nat 20s through the whole movie, and pulled off the biggest **** Their emotions did not make sense and they flip flopped more than Mitt Romney. They even botched the death scene for Carrie Fisher. How you can even botch that is beyond me.",0
570,"Another reminder of ruined Skywalker legacy. The only thing, that it can offer - good visuals and nothing more.",0
571,"This movie was awful. There was not a minute of exposition the entire film. Whenever there was a problem the characters would stumble into the solution by sheer coincidence. The power scaling with respect to established cannon as well as the EU was comical. The only scene from previous films in the trilogy that mattered was Luke’s death. There were more ass pulls, including a power of friendship power boost, than even the worst anime. It’s not worth the money. Don’t watch it.",0
572,The worst part of the franchise. Too much fan service. The story is disgusting. the last Jedi were not so bad. I hope Abrams will no longer make a single film in this universe.,0
573,"no spoiler here. ROS is an ok movie. The first half is kinda fun, goes into a lull, then complete silliness. Plot holes run wild. Think of ROS as fast food, its fine when you're watching/eating it but afterwards your left with an empty feeling. Unfortunately, there's so much being introduced its too little to late. ROS is a retcon of Last Jedi and tries its best to fix what happened in the middle movie. You're safe to wait for this to be rented - nothing super special here. A ton of false starts, broken promises and ultimately a hollow movie. For true star wars fans the last 3 movies is not canon but basically an alternate universe. These movies deserve a reboot. Save some money and wait till this is released at Redbox.",0
574,Awful. Completely undermines the original 6 movies. Not to mention the movie itself is a sloppy mess.,0
575,"Help us Baby Yoda, you're our only hope. The Rise of Skywalker is like a fat kid with the keys to a candy store. Everything looks shiny and wonderful to begin with, but after 20 minutes you're not swallowing it. You're choking on the reality that this is going to make you sick. For weeks. The script is terrible. The pacing is frantic yet boring at the same time. The characters are still two-dimensional. And no one really dies now – just our hope. There are a few good moments (the arrival of the larger ""people's"" fleet, the ocean light sabre battle and Chewie's anguish), but they're lost among dull dancing kite-loving aliens, long boring speeches, a mindless McGuffin quest, and giddy up, space horsies. (Give an Oscar to that angry horse that tells BB8 to bugger off. Best acting in the film.) Rey's big parental reveal lacks any emotional intensity. Palpatine's first appearance has no build up and hence no impact. Wedge appears for two seconds. R2D2 gets less time than some robotic hair dryer who adds zero – yes, zero – to the movie. And the porgs are back. Not spit roasted either.Hux is an embarrassing afterthought. Lando is underused.  What on Endor are the ewoks even in the film? And the Knights of Ren – space goths with nothing to do – skulk around and look scary but miss the chance several times to kill the good guys. Nice that they have staves but no guns. Must come in handy at the baton twirling competitions.Amazingly, the two new female characters (who are really cool) get next-to-no screen time, despite Kathleen Kennedy's push that the ""Force is female"". Did someone say ""Captain Phasma""?They're brushed aside for complete dullard characters like bearded pilot Snap Wexley and that Hobbit bloke – you know the one. Nope? They and the giant alien sea cucumber in the background of the Falcon have the appeal of those giant waving air sock men you see outside used car lots.When Wexley dies by being shot out the sky and crashing into a star destroyer, I cheered. A Canto Bight donkey died somewhere for me thinking that, but hey, hopefully the universe is a safer place.Worse, the film seems to be a poor knock-off of Twilight. Rey is Bella Swan, but instead of being fought over by a vampire and a werewolf, her affections are torn between a Sith and stormtrooper. Awww. And just like Twilight, the pasty-faced white male wins; remarkable, considering that he's responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people.Whoops. Move along, nothing to see here.Oh, and did Finn ever tell Rey what he wanted to say? Maybe, ""Can you use the Force to get us out of this disaster?""Sniffy ""mainstream"" reviewers claim that The Rise of Skywalker panders to fans, but then again, missing the great irony that isn't that what big franchises (and indeed, movies) rely on. We buy the tickets, they don't. And as fans, Disney has a major headache in convincing us to keep buying those tickets moving forward.Time to put the lightsaber through some Disney executives careers and sack the entire writing team as well.",0
576,"So many questions. Rey is so OP it doesn't make sense to take anyone to fight with her. When they fall through the sand into the underground cave, why doesn't the sand fall through the hole as well?  Why are Star Destroyers as powerful as the Death Star? Why is the entire fleet of Star Destroyers hidden under the ice on Exogul, a planet so hard to find that you need an old school nav system to find out?  Why are the Star Destroyers only able to be piloted if they are in communication with a puny antennae or the ""mothership"" and when the ""mothership"" goes down why are these massive technologically advanced ships rendered useless?   Is it the hive queen from Ender's Game? I don't even know. Just hope this is Disney's last Star Wars movie. Ugh.",0
577,"Ok so where to begin?  It’s revealed that Luke and Lando knew about Palpatine and the hidden Sith planet and set about trying to find it, but didn't tell anyone else, including their good pals Han and Chewie, yep ok.  They came quite close to finding the pyramid thing to show them the way to the hidden planet, so close that Luke wrote it down in some Jedi journal, but, did not share this information with  his sister Leia, who was still the leader of the resistance, and was also a Jedi trained by Luke, ok makes total sense so far.  Then for some reason Luke goes in hiding on a remote planet. when Rey the new hope arrives and he trains her he again fails to tell Rey the bigger picture, yep perfect.  But on the other side, Palpatine creates a super force out of basically nothing for um ""reasons"" and waits in the shadows for the final order, waiting for the sake of just waiting (he executes the final order before Rey arrives, so he wasn’t waiting for her).  This is all kept a secret from Kylo because Palpatine wants to use him to lure Rey somehow so he can pursuade her, his granddaughter its revealed (uh huh yep) to kill him so that….....meh seriously I cannot even finish this plot review, it is such a disservice to the original trilogy, prequels, and even to episodes 7 & 8.  Basically the whole prequel build up of Anakin/Vader to the eventual redemption/sacrifice of Vader/Anakin meant nothing because Palpatine miraculously lived anyway.This is what happens when you make up crap as you go.  Do us all a favor Disney and admit your mistakes and start again with a well thought out plot that makes sense for all 9 movies, with George Lucas’s input.  It gets 2 points for the little alien dude.BTW if force healing or whatever it’s called is a thing....why didn't Luke just put his hands on Anakin at the end of Episode 6 and um heal him, like Rey did to Kylo??",0
578,"A simple Disney Movie, not a really Star Wars Movie...I really sad when i fineshed this watch",0
579,"For me, the worst Star Wars movie ever made. While the prequel trilogy got its fair share of justifiable criticism, it's one saving grace was the grand narrative (the rise of darth vader, the emperor and the empire) that tied everything together and engaged the fans. This sequel trilogy—perfectly summed up in the rise of skywalker—is an incoherent mess with absolutely no substance, depth, or character development. A truly awful movie, and this is coming from someone who is a massive star wars fan. I naively had faith that they would do right in this movie and right the wrongs of the last two movies. How wrong I was. Safe to say that I'm absolutely gutted right now. In terms of the story, we are almost in exactly the same place as we were at the end of Return of the Jedi, with two exceptions: Disney will be several billion dollars richer, and many star wars fans will have given up on the franchise completely. Oh, and for the record, I think Daisy Ridley is a very poor actress. I never felt any connection to her character in any of the three sequel films. Terrible, just terrible.",0

In an attempt to clean up countless plot holes and unsatisfying plot twists from the previous movie in the trilogy, TROS introduces one of the biggest character retcons in cinematic history.  It's the 11th hour in the newly labeled 'Skywalker Saga', and the amount of exposition required to justify new plot events and characters is overwhelming.

If you don't care about the plot and you like a lot of action , then it's maybe it's a 4 or 5/5 stars for you. Rey keeps being overpowered , she levitates wih the force at the beginning but it never does it again. She heals and throws force lightning , without need of training on it before. Palpatine is somehow alive an connected to a machine (never explained how) . Rey and Kylo can teleport things between them with the force (somehow). All in the movie progresses only for convenience, not for real development. Palpatine made somehow an army of thousands of Star Destroyers, each with cannons as powerlful as the  death star. But conveniently , the Star Destroyers can't activate their shields in the atmosphere (Why?) and very conveniently destroying 1 star destroyer leaves the entire fleet useless. Palpatine is powerful enough to attack all the rebel fleet  with Force lightning, but Rey can repel his attack easy to him (after listening all the jedi of the past) , causing an explosion. Kylo heals Rey, they kiss, and Kylo dies. The Resistance wins, the imperial fleet of the ""Final order"" is defeated easily. At least Chewbacca gets his medal. Rey at the end gets a yellow lightsaber and says ""I'm Rey...Rey Skywalker""",0

593,This movie tried to do too much and suffered for it. Left the theatre feeling apathy. I couldn't care much for the new characters introduced in a finale. The regression of story arcs for characters like Finn and Poe. Tropes that open a little under a dozen plot holes. Pace was far too fast. 3 hours with half as much content but more respect for previous material would have been enough room to wrap things up. The exceptional effort by the acting and visual design crew is the only thing keeping this review from 1 star. The script writers need to watch some Star Wars before putting pen to paper,0

Overall the movie tries to fix the disaster that the Last Jedi made but it left me wanting more, the prequels are now questioned because of the events of the Rise of Skywalker and undermines Anakins sacrifice. In reality although it does attempt and in some cases fixes the disaster that the Last Jedi was it does so with a lot of action and Star Wars fan service but ultimately it is still an insult to the first six episodes and leaves huge plot holes open.",0

If the heroes don’t have a definitive way of stopping him, then how do we truly know if Palpatine is dead. Not to mention the fact that Rey, someone with very little experience could best the emperor. Just as a reminder; Mace Windu and several jedi knights lost, Yoda lost, Luke lost.  What about Vader’s way finder.??? If Vader was aware of Palpatine’s secret hiding spot, why didn’t he tell luck in Return of the Jedi, “Luke, he might still be alive. We need to check this spot where he had a contingency plan. Here’s my way finder to get there.”   But I guess that’s just a plot hole. Ohh and the emperor announces that he has returned. WHY?????  “Hey everyone, the emperor here, I’m alive. And yea, don’t try to stop me.”   I guess the emperor is just mentally challenged. Why would he announce his presence? Why not sneak attack with all those death star/star destroyers.???? And we still don’t know the state of the galaxy.

You cannot make a boring uninspired premise in the first part of the trilogy, **** it up in every conceivable way in the second part and expect to compensate in the finale of a trilogy simply by pumping up the pace by 300%. The movie is a mess. Palpatine´s  plan is retarded from the get go and the very fact he even is in the movie is exactly as it sounds before you even watch it... It doesnt make sense and its incredibly forced and obvious he´s simply there to make up for the **** up that was Snoke´s character and demise. The previous movies made lightsabers a joke and this one adds the force to the things disney sw ruined. There are no rules and no limitations, especially if you´re Rey. Other than that, the movie is nice to look at, though you better not think about what you´re looking at. Just enjoy the visuals. And Rey is also nice to look at, which is ofc the only interesting thing about her ""character"".

Rey never goes evil,  would of been a great twist and a cool fight. Light saber randomly fixed from last film. Lando flies the whole galaxy and finds a million ships in 30 mins just after last movie  when no one came. No one dies. Best part of the whole film is where rey uses lightening. The only surprising and cool part of the film.Final fight is bad, 1 saber not enough..2 Sabres suddenly enough. The emperor lightning himself for the 3rd time.  Planet destroyers for the 4th time. Batman vs superman writer is obsessed with mothers in fight scenes, happens atleast twice. It's the same as batman vs superman in reverse. Knights of the ren seemed pointless and bad, just to sell toys. Compare knights of the ren with snokes guards, who were much more entertaining. You can blow up big ship by shooting its gun with a tiny one. Only 1 ship in huge fleet has gps. Did I mention there are no plot twists and no one dies. Rey going evil was a major dick tease as that would of been good writing. Finn ends up seeming pointless, never see what he wanted to say to rey. Rose randomly in the film. Waiting for falcon, turns up 2 mins later... just edit that line and make space for.. actual plot?The visuals are great, the directing could be better and just seems very forced and the writing is absolute garabage. Why hire that superman v batman morob is beyond me. And why did they do the sony route of trying to.copy marvel with different directors but cram it in 5 years. No consistent vision throughout the films. Promising but with a better writer and more coherent directing, could of been so so much better. Instead we are left with a rushed crammed mess full of things that make no sense  with zero sense of suspense or drama. It seems a lot of poor choice made by the movie executives trying to copy marvel, leading to a bland plot and a disjointed trilogy as a whole.Also everyone can start healing everyone now, so why Darth Vader became Darth Vader to save his gal is apparently pointless cos he could of just touched her and breathed. That would not have mattered if they hadn't kept reffering to vader over and over. You really could go on with the flaws and missed potential with this film and trilogy.  The 2nd one (TLJ) was probably the best as it had great duels and actual plot twists. Evil rey.. just a lil tease but could of been really good.The writer and director needs to go in the bin. The visual effects are brilliant.  So much potential wasted, so so sad. A crammed rushed movie with a very very weak plot with no surprises except the opening credits with palpentine randomly back. The visuals are its redeeming qualities so that brings it up to a 2.",0

617,"Thank God the Disney Star Wars movies are done, for now anyway.  This movie was gonna lose no matter what it did: if it appealed solely to the SJW commies, we'd get yet another ""Wahmen good, men bad"" narrative that completely missed the point of Star Wars; if it appealed to fans (and it did), it's too little too late, you already bashed us for being hateful ""istaphobes"" because apparently we don't like women (even though we do) or colored people (even though we do).Between the ret-conned plot twist about Rey's lineage, Finn and Poe trying to feel like actual characters, and the totally left-field addition of Palpatine, Kylo Renn again turns out to be the only decent character in this trilogy, even though he's still just a bastardized version of Jacen Solo.This movie will likely flop, and Disney will have to inflate the numbers like they did with Captain Marvel to make it look like it's a success.  Joke's on them, nobody's gonna watch it in theaters, nobody's gonna buy it on DVD, and nobody is gonna look back on this fondly.",0

There is a really good story just under all this but the pacing is off, and  they throw so much information at you that you are trying to keep up.  In the end it feels like they relied on fan service than a proper ending. I wish George Lucas had remained on board to write this trilogy. Anything you might say about the prequels or his dialogue, he combined each movie so it at least made sense.  This was the capstone of there being no clear direction from Episode 7, no unified story. No story that made sense. And that's heartbreaking. Abrams put his unfortunate twist on episode 7 which had a domino effect of creating new mysteries instead of telling the story of what happened between all those years. And that mess ended here. Now you might be asking, why don't I at least give this a mixed review, because i obviously like some things. Because the use of strobe lights mean certain fans can't watch it. And no one should be denied the chance to watch it over a visual effect.",0
629,"This trilogy has done nothing but character assassinate the heroes from Episodss 1-6, made all those movies meaningless,  and replaced The Chosen One (Anakin) with Rey.

This trilogy was clearly all about the money.They had no plans no new ideas no nothing,they just wanted their money.The movie was just like the trilogy, it was souless, mindless and rushed.New empire, new death star death laser beams, Palpatine survived but they didnt even know how  or  they just didnt bother.No new interesting planets just a bunch of desert worlds,and re used places.No ineteresting characters just bunch of cliché  and forgotable sidekicks and some merchandising friendly creatures, i cant even remember their names.The jokes are lame too ,the movie was boring and predictable.They wanted the old cast back but they didnt do **** with them.They had so many oppurtunities.But hey we have this new girl who had a few lines with Luke and then became the most powerful Jedi in the history.Awesome.The movie has basically the same ending that the return of the jedi had, so why,why did the even make this?Im just sad that this is what have start wars become.I hope they fire Kennedy after this and then we might have some hope that we can have watchable SW movies again.",0
631,"My neck hurts because of the countless times I had to shake my head while watching this movie. Let's start with the good things: The movie looks great as always and the jokes are better then the ones in The Last Jedi. That's it. The movie begins by establishing a new story which has almost no connection to the events shown in the previous movies. It's obvious that J.J Abrams tried to save the trilogie with this movie, but he failed. Seems like everyone can use healing powers now (why didn't Luke heal Darth Vader at the end of Episode 6?), Kylo Ren can grab objects that are lightyears away and Palpatin builds an armada consisting of thousands of Star Destroyers (which are all equiped with weapons as powerful as the Death Star, because why not?)on a planet that is the least hostile place in the universe and without ANYONE noticing it. Scenes like the one where Rey is holding back an entire spaceship by using the force are just the icing on the cake. This whole movie is a mess and (hopefully) the final nail in the coffin.",0
632,Look at the movies out now for Christmas and what a mess you will see. This is what Hollywood drops for its consumers. And the worst of all is this Star Wars movie which is unbearable.

The only decent movie now playing is Knives out and that is 1 out of 12 at my theater. Disgusting.,0

644,"This movie is a giant middlefinger to everybody, especially George Lucas, and his creation. It's what happens when you give it to people that have ABSOLUTELY NO UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWLEDGE to what Star Wars is, but they sure have an agenda. It COMPLETELY breaks the lore, the world and characters of Star Wars. Instead of listing everything (which is just too much), I will simply say - go and watch shadiversity's amazing review/breakdown: ""The Rise of Skywalker is TRASH of the highest order, STAR WARS full in-depth review"".I was thinking of giving it a more reasonable score (of 2, because even as a movie it simply fails on EVERY aspect - pacing, plot, characters, EDITING, etc), but since we have a flood of trolls and disney accounts leaving 10/10s (especially on RT), I will simply leave a 0/10. It's what this movie is to me anyway, as a Star Wars fanatic that understands the deeper meanings that George Lucas embedded in his work, which ironically were completely destroyed the same way Palpatine destroyed the Jedi order - through careful manipulation, twisting of truth and the corruption of Good. It might've been simply ignorance and stupidity (and it's totally the case at least to a degree), but the end result is all the same.Evil cannot create, it can only corrupt.",0

Why not leave us asking questions rather than answering or pretending to answer everything! This could have and should have taken more risks ... allowed for scenes to develop more ... and slowed down ... the first films allowed us to sit with scenes such as the trash compactor / Luke learning with Yoda / Jabba’s Palace ... for longer allowing atmosphere to build - this film SPED through every set up disallowing ANY immersion,0

650,"2.5/5A big missed opportunity for new ideas and advancing the story set up in the previous two films, instead opting for a frantic pace and cliched themes that never have much emotional resonance. An emotionally sterile experience that even the sometimes brilliant visuals cannot redeem or make more exciting. The camerawork is a step down from the last film - maybe even the least interesting of all the Star Wars films. It had a distinct “this was rushed” feel to it.The story is barely comprehensible, derivative, and so desperate to reset what occurred The Last Jedi by indulging in unnecessary nostalgia that comes off as eye roll worthy. There is no sense of urgency or dread that should be present in this final installment.The big reveals have no weight to them, and are hardly believable. If this movie had tried a little harder to sell us the half baked ideas present, maybe it would have worked better, but its creators aren’t interested in telling a good story, just reaching the finish line.Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver redeem this film as much as it can be by giving strong, captivating performances with the meager third-rate material they have to work with. Their scenes should have been longer and it’s a shame they weren’t given a more worthy script for their acting skills and how far their characters had come. Instead their characters are two-dimensional and just react instead of really interacting. A true shame.Overall there are glimmers of an interesting film, but it has been handled with such absence of grace or nuance that those are all but completely swallowed up by the chaotic mess of this film.This trilogy deserved something better after the high bar set by The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. There is really no excuse for this sloppy mess of a movie which is ultimately a great cultural disappointment.",0

Rey no es una Jedi, no sabe pelear y se inventa poderes de la nada. La muerte de Leía es lamentable, no han sabido darle un final digno y han hecho lo primero que se les ha ocurrido. A Fin le han querido dar más protagonismo y ojalá no lo hubiesen hecho ya que se han inventado que es sensible a la fuerza... Madre mía la escena del Destructor Imperial, que entre los miles de ellos que hay dice uno al hazar y acierta cual es el que da las órdenes... De que en la batalla final solo ataque una sola nave enemiga no voy ni a hablar por que es una auténtica estupidez, literalmente solo hay una nave que dispara cuando tienen una flota de miles de naves preparadas para arrasar planetas enteros...

Its like they left it vague so there could be another movie coming, not a finale. The ending is absolutely not satisfying or hopeful. Only desolation. The fans feel this, yet somehow, the characters were not allowed to portray it in any acceptable capacity. Leaks told us Ben would be with her in the end, but all we got was a broken heart.

New planets and characters appeared then were gone before I could get a chance to care that they were gone.  I keep hearing John Williams's score was fantastic, but I remember hearing very little of it over all the pews, zooms and booms blasted into my eardrums.  By the time Abrams decided to slow down and do some actual character development in the second half of the movie, my senses were too battered to take any of the rest of the movie in.  I wanted to walk out at that point, but stuck with it only so I'd know what happens without having to sit through the movie again.  I won't sit through the movie again.

Then... the third arc began and it was fine... but the ending killed EVERYTHING about this movie. This once again just shows me that Disney higher-ups have NO ONE who cares about the series involved in making the film. Very few things make sense and it shows that they have no idea what Star wars is about. Luckily, Jon Favreau is working his brains out trying to save star wars with the Mandalorian.The music was good, the visuals were amazing. the acting was perfection. But... the writing... the writing was literally the worse fan fiction one could think up. I could have asked my 9-year-old nephew to come up with a better story for this movie. Is it the worst star wars movie ever? well... maybe. in my personal opinion, No. but my God is it close. The sequel trilogy would have been SO much better if they combined 7 and 8, and made 9 2 movies.",0
669,"Sadly the Disney Star Wars trilogy goes out with a whimper rather than a bang.  This movie suffers from incredibly bad pacing, a boring fetch quest main storyline, and ridiculously unbalanced force powers never seen before.  Mary Sue Rey becomes space Jesus and steals the ""Skywalker"" name even though her parentage is finally revealed to be the exact opposite.  The only positive aspect of the film is that it does reverse many of the bad decisions of Last Jedi.  But I still cannot recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the original lore and spirit of the Star Wars movies, ie the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy.  There is nothing original here except that JJ tries to 'fix everything' by making Rey completely OP.  Bottom line: Two thumbs down.  This movie should have been titled Rise of Palpatine.",0

They introduce new characters halfway through the final movie of this trilogy and then abruptly drop that character's storyline or just give the character an extremely vague ending which comes off as lazy and incomplete. There are multiple moments in the movie where I felt like I missed something or that there were additional scenes that were cut last minute and the remaining scenes do not link well together.",0
672,"After seeing the amount of positivity this movie received I felt called to review this disgrace after seeing it yesterday. Star wars was built on story and good characters. Disney star wars is built on visuals, cheap action and plot holes. Ill make it simple:Story 2/10 - Surprisenly had potential but suffers from a huge lack of continuity between the movies, contradictions with the entire story of the real star wars trilogy. The continuity is so bad, for example- you probably forgot Finn had feelings for rey and rose, those storylines are ignored outright? The continuity faltered mostly because of the last jedi but the criticism must remain on this movie.Characters 2/10 - Again, potential but nothing goes anywhere. Kylo Ren was a pretty interesting character and his redemption is kindof believable. They handled leia well considering the circumstances. Otherwise, everyone else acts incompetent (even the Emporer, which is really not his character) and its frustrating to watch. Finns storm trooper background has zero depth and is ignored. Reys final character arc is a solution to her identity crisis: I can be anyone. Its absolutely pathetic and misplaced. We get tons of new characters which we learn nothing about???Visuals 8.5/10 - Everything looked really well but i have to dismiss some of the score because nothing, absolutely nothing intrigued me except exogol (This place was sick, refreshing). Otherwise, there is no creativity- how many desert and water planets do we need to see? At the start of the movie we get to see a few planets which actually look unique and new however, we see them for 30 seconds? Oh look a worm from the original saga... Is every planet in the star wars universe an ice planet? I will admit this is a little picky but in reality it isnt hard to produce new concepts, so I have to take off score cause this kind of fault is inexcusable.Music 8/10 - John williams, I dont think its his best work but its good.Conclusion 2/10 - This movie is a decent ending to the sequels but an awful ending to the skywalker saga (It makes no sense and undermines the story of anakin skywalker). I feel that the last jedi set the bar so low, people are thrilled to see a decent sequel. This movie is carried by the previous films via nostalgia. Every bit of emotion from the sequels is from elements from the previous films. That's the problem, there is absolutely no organic emotion because the audience is detached from the new characters and story...",0
673,"This trilogy will be remembered forever as, the disney trilogy bad.You really do a trilogy and nobody says but what the crap is this? I still don't understand how someone disney responsible for this ""trilogy"" has resigned.It seems that this movie has been made by someone who does not know star wars and only tries to please fans in the only way he thinks is the best, crushing old characters, inventing powers that destroy any type of meaning in the canon.The best thing you can do, Disney, is to make us forget about this BAD DISNEY TRILOGY. saying goodbye to all those responsible for this nonsense and assuming your mistake.",0

Leia behaves dead ( The actress is), Rose is pushed to the sidelines, and the attempt at humor this time around is C-3PO, a rehashed yawn fest.

The final movie in the Skywalker saga not only manages to fail on its own level but also introduces new themes and ideas that retroactively wrecks the other films in the series, most notably Return of the Jedi. In addition, this is probably the worst trilogy in cinematic history as episodes 8 and 9 directly clashed with each other.If you want some mindless fun, this film would work as the pacing is so frenetic it doesn't allow for any introspection. I'd put it on the same level as Independence Day 2.",0

J.J. Abrams hizo todo lo que pudo para explicar los sin sentidos que nos trajo Rian Johnson y lo felicito por ello, si no fuera porque se vio obligado a recurrir al Emperador en un intento desesperado para salvar la trilogía. Mientras veía la cinta no pude evitar pensar, ""esto va demasiado rápido"", cuando salí de la sala una de mis conclusiones fue ""deberían haber hecho un episodio 10 para explicar mejor, dar mas desarrollo y concluir mejor la saga"" porque en serio, no paraban un solo segundo para darse un descanso, menos en el final, cuando ganan, porque ahí si decidieron tomarse todo el tiempo que quisieron, sumado a que claro, era claro que no habría un episodio 10, todo por la restricción de tres películas. Volviendo, lo que no pude soportar fue que, metan todas las teorías que quieran, canon o no, Palpatine siga vivo y que tenga una tremenda flota de naves con armas destruye planetas, fue forzado, todo porque Snoke se murió en la cinta anterior y nadie sabia que hacer. Pero claro, revivamos al Emperador y que los fans se imaginen como, pero no revivamos al villano que debería de tener la trilogía, todo bien. No pude evitar soltar una risa cuando, en los párrafos del inicio, pusieron de entrada ""Rey esta entrenando"", sentí que quedaron traumatizados después de las criticas. Ahora, pasemos con lo que me gusto/no me molesto de la cinta: los poderes curativos parecían ya existir en el canon de Star Wars, o eso leí, por lo que no opine mucho al respecto; cuando apareció Rey, entrenando, pensé ""bueno, ahora ya tienen la excusa para justificar todo lo que venga"" por ende no me sorprendí ante los siguientes sucesos en la cinta. Por otro lado, algo ridículo, fue cuando Chewbacca no murió en la secuencia que no presentaron y quede como ""pero, ¿no estaba en esa nave...?"", no, era otra nave, fue medio patético. Leia se entreno para ser Jedi, muy bien, al menos eso explica como logro hacer toda esa escena mística en el Ep. 8. Al fin sabemos algo sobre los padres de Rey, ¿no es algo que debíamos haber visto en el Ep. 8? Si, pero Johnson era medio idiota. ¿Cómo fue que Palpatine tuvo un hijo? Que la Fuerza te lo explique. ¿Se acuerdan de Rose? ¿Ese personaje que no fue muy querido en la cinta anterior? No se preocupen, aparece mucho menos y no hace el ridículo.Pude captar ciertas referencias al episodio 5, cuando Kylo Ren le pide a Rey que tome su mano y enfrenten al Emperador, eso medio me gusto. Por otro lado, en la batalla final, cuando llega el Halcón con todas esas naves, me recordó a la escena de portales en Endgame, pero claro, no es tan épica, sino que esta anunciado ni bien arranca la batalla. También hay nuevos personajes que jamas tendrán desarrollo alguno, regla de tres cintas, no lo olviden, pero siempre tendremos los spin-off. Ah, casi lo olvido, en la cinta nos cuentan que hubo otras batallas antes de llegar a donde se encontraban en la película, a lo que pregunto: ¿Como fue que sucedieron esas peleas si apenas tenían recursos y tripulación? Según parece, sacaron unos comics para darnos un contexto para comprender el inicio de la cinta, eso no me gusto. Los comics que sacan de Star Wars nos pueden contar historias de cosas que sucedieron entre las películas, explicaciones sobre la fuerza, detalles sobre Jedis y Sith, todo para enriquecer mas el universo, pero, en un principio, no eran necesario si solo veías las películas, y no debían serlo, si los querías leer era para el gusto personal de uno, no para que entiendas porque sucede lo que sucede.En conclusión, Abrams tenia un juguete envuelto en llamas y tenia que buscar la forma de jugar con el. ¿Hizo lo mas que pudo? Si, por eso le pongo esta calificación a esta cinta. ¿Fue lo suficiente para cerrar con dignidad la trilogía? Absolutamente no. Podría pasarme un buen rato hablando sobre muchas otras cosas que la cinta nos arroja, que tampoco me gustaron, y que quedan en completas incógnitas y/o que no tienen sentido en absoluto, pero no veo necesario arrojar mas leña al fuego. Star Wars - El ascenso de Skywalker, hace todo para cerrar de una jodida vez la historia, y que sea de una manera absurda es lamentable, sumado a que es una historia que ya, en mi opinión, no puede continuarse mas, pero con la empresa del ratón siendo su dueño, no estoy seguro y eso me preocupa.",0
680,"The whole movie feels more like a sequence of single shots/scenes. The storyline has more than a few plotholes and tries to hard to rehash some of the most iconic scenes from episode 6.

683,"Terrible character development, jumps from scene to scene/place to place every 5 seconds and feels like a juvenile movie of scenes stitched together. The plot is old and and utterly overused, offers nothing new to the series while taking so much away from the George Lucas Star Wars. Riddled with plot holes, annoying token wokeness and all builds up to a flat ending that nobody cares about or is invested in. I just wanted the entire galaxy to blow up as it needs to end, but unfortunately it doesn't and just ends in a hug fest that feels cheesy by now. Just watch the original Return of the Jedi as that's 1000 times better than this and is basically the same story without any of the same issues. The end is that Rey kills Palpatine, kill being used lightly in the constantly reversible Star Wars universe, by deflecting his force lightning with two light sabers, then he blows up and dies instead of stopping his own lightning, literally that's it. Then Kylo force heals Rey, Rey kisses Kylo, before Kylo rolls over and dies too.As a bigger alert, the mise en scène is the worst I have ever seen at cinema. It's dark with so much flashing strobe style lightnig, presumably as a last ditch effort to give a poorly written, produced and directed film some character. If you suffer with headache disorders, epilepsy or any type of light sensitive disorder then please don't risk this poor movie. Even Disney put out a health warning due to the high use of strobe lighting. A friend of mine took ill at the cinema towards the movie due to the lighting and are very angry that the warning didn't proceed the film, it was just a generic post by Disney that as a group we didn't know about until afterwards. I don't normally give films 1 out of 10, but this movie was so flat, disappointing and destructive that I can't see where I can give it more than 1 out of 10.",0

689,"I went into this movie with an open mind, really hoping that JJ could somehow finesse this ending after the depths of hell that Rain Johnson left it in. I was bitterly disappointed. Where I left the theatre of TLJ mad this time it's just frustration. From the opening crawl announcing that Palpatine was inexplicably back from the dead to Kylo and Rey kissing this movie was an absolute disaster from a story and plot perspective. Having this movie center around the most used villain in Star Wars and then again turn the story so that he is the penultimate bad guy is just ridiculous in my opinion. This movie did not close anything, in fact none of the movies in this current trilogy have added anything to the Star Wars universe. The best character that they created was Ben Solo, who got maybe 3 minutes of screen time before getting killed off in most likely the worst scene in Star Wars ever - first Rey dies, oh wait Ben is using the force to bring her back! Wow they kiss the crowd goes wild! Wait Ben is dead now! I just about walked out of the theatre at that point. This movie has its moments, but is always followed with an over the top/non sensical moment that sours the great scene that came before it. The battle between Kylo and Rey is a perfect example. Its a great lightsaber battle and ends in dramatic fashion with Rey stabbing Kylo in the stomach. But literally 3 seconds after the shot of him getting stabbed she somehow uses the force to heal his wound. I mean talk about not letting a scene breathe it was honestly obscene. The more I tried to just relax and enjoy the more I found myself hating it. Seriously, could be worse than TLJ.",0

692,"I can see Disney’s paid shills are dropping tens on this abortion, so I’m here to let potential viewers know just how bad this is.A BAND-AID FOR THE LAST JEDIJar-Jar “Mystery Box” Abrams decided to try and fix portions of the TLJ instead of just accepting that those mistakes were now the reality of the franchise.Remember how “The Holdo Maneuver” makes space battles pointless, since you can just light-speed ram presumably anything. Well, apparently now. “That was a 1 in a million shot,” Poe says at one point. Uh, what? How?  He doesn’t say. Remember how pointless Snoke was, how his death meant nothing?  Well JJ decided that Palpatine “made” Snoke. How? Why?  Don’t know. Doesn’t say.Remember how the universe just didn't care about the plight of the Resistance in TLJ?  How no help came to assist them against a walker assault on the salt planet?  Well in THIS movie, they ALL show up, but instead of fighting some walkers, they’re here to take on a fleet of capital ships with planet-destroying technology.  Makes ZERO sense. MYSTERY-BOX ABRAMS WANTS IT TO BE MARVELI wonder if JJ even liked Star Wars. It’s clear he wants to be Marvel.  Palpatine has ‘LIGHTNING ATTACK’ (copyright Disney 2019). Rey has ‘FORCE HEAL’. Kylo?  Well he gets beat by Rey again and again. I guess that’s his power.There’s even the generic ‘beam of energy going into the sky’ that has become so commonplace in terrible superhero movies.NOTHING MAKES SENSE, AND WHO CARES ANYWAYCapital ships can’t turn on their shields until they ‘leave the atmosphere’. Why? Dunno. For the plot. People die, come back, die, come back. Makes everything feel pointless. Knights of Ren?  Die faster and easier than Stormtroopers.Keeping Leia around after TLJ?  Oh, so she can use her power of ‘FORCE SKYPE’ to contact Kylo and make him lose another fight against Rey. Then she dies from the effort. Bravo JJ. THE HACKERY; OH GOD THE HACKERYI think the awful writers (Terrio, Abrams) must have just heard phrases from Star Wars before and so decided that characters MUST say them. Not because it’s, you know, something they needed to communicate, but because FANS would REMEMBER when that character said something similar. Palpatine says “ORDER” like a dozen times. REMEMBER WHEN HE SAID ‘EXECUTE ORDER 66’ OMG I MEMBER. He even recites basically all his dialogue from RoTJ.Wanna hear another gem?Palpatine:  “I am ALL of the Sith!”Rey:  “And I am ALL of the Jedi!”Bravo hacks. And Hollywood wonders why no one goes to see movies anymore. THE FINAL INSULTThis isn’t just a bad movie. It’s a movie so bad it ruins the other good movies in the series. Palpatine being back undercuts both Luke and Anakin’s journey. It takes the good things about Star Wars and literally sacrifices them in this terrible attempt to make a buck. It’s lazy, it’s stupid, it’s poorly-written, poorly acted, poorly directed.  It feels like a mediocre video game brought to the screen. It’s garbage through and through, and taint the entire Star Wars legacy forever.",0

This is the classic example of too many hands in the pot and trying to course correct when its too late. 2+ hours of breakneck speed to try and resolve 2 previous movies at the same time destroying what was presented before, and not explaining or addressing the how or why.

This movie adds nothing to the lore and does nothing except try to fix all of the mistakes of the last movie. Any real Star Wars fan will see this and the rest of this dumpster fire of a trilogy for what it is. An unnecessary, low effort, poorly planned cash grab. Do not mistake these films for actual sequels. They are not. Lucas wrote an actual sequel trilogy. Demand that those be made. The fact that Disney thought they could just throw the official cannon in the garbage is a travesty!",0
699,"This film by itself was a complete mess. And as the third film in a trilogy it's also a complete mess. There was too much story crammed into one film. Major events happen then get completely reversed a couple of scenes later. The plot of the first half of the film involves a ridiculous mcguffin which makes no sense (why would anyone create a random dagger in the shape of the death star ruins with a weird device pointing at the throne room?). The overall plot of the film (the Emperor returning) is introduced with no explanation, and the final battle resolves itself through shonen anime logic - Rey wins effectively through the ""power of friendship"" of having all the previous Jedi on her side. It's never explained why ""all the Jedi"" beats ""all the Sith"" which are apparently in Palpatine. And that's not even mentioning the nonsense that is Ben resurrecting Rey with the force, which completely undermines the point of the prequel trilogy. And it just flat out retcons major plot and character developments from the previous film! There were a few positives, however. C-3PO was consistently funny without getting stale. Babu Frik was hilarious. The Ben and Rey scenes were very well acted (even though the story itself was crap). But ultimately, the vast majority of this film was just complete nonsense.",0

702,"The opinion of one film critic about star wars episode ix - the rise of skywalker with which I completely agree:Full fiasco. The apogee of idiocy. **** All the tragedy, appearance, disappearance, erasure and rewriting of characters do not cause any emotions. For one simple reason. Absurdity, I emphasize, is absurdity, and not fantastic, unreality or fairy-tale. It is the absurdity of what is happening that kills all the drama in the bud. When you do not just not believe, but really about going crayzy from camels, some of which fly fast, and some to the north.From that frantic sleep of a madman that unfolds on the screen - all these tear-squeezing scenes do not give rise to a single drop of feelings. Moreover, due to the fact that all this nonsense is mixed up in one heap, and is trying to tell something there, it is incomprehensible even to those who understand the topic. It is simply meaningless. And because of this, you stare indifferently at the screen, as if at colorful bubbles gurgling in an artificial thematic pond.Handsomely. Zero meaning. But it’s beautiful. Actually, if they had done footage with copy-paste equipment, flashes and explosions, without a plot at all, but for two hours, then this has changed little. In addition, of course, that ceased to be so stupid.And the worst thing about Star Wars is that the last episode is boring. Its stupidly boring to watch. Oh my god, even Ryan Johnson's **** was more exciting and interesting!How many suitcases were brought to the “critics” who praised all this, huh?About the plot, Palpatine, illogical perpetuations of heroes, I will not speak yet. Leave for review. Not because there is complete nonsense. I would think so if emotions left this bag of the best manure. But because it’s just a dull, dull **** elevated to the degree of infinity!But the most annoying thing is that you imagine that YOU could do with all this potential, and almost start to tear off the hair on your head. Let the various birds accuse the critics of the new trilogy (including me) of “senselessly digging into the“ little things ”. The fact that ""the fans are to blame for what happened."" This does not change the main thing. If the script was written by mediocrity, then neither disputes with the fans, nor “squandering” under them, will give this script artistic value.The paranoid delirium of a crazy serial killer and the narcotic hallucinations of an addict dying of an overdose grandly outstripped Joel Schumacher Batman and Robin frenzy and made it so much that Joel Schumacher himself began nervously smoking aside , is what the rise of skywalker actually is.For the gifted - this is not a review. This is an indictment in a criminal case on the wear and tear of a corpse of Princess Leia !",0

713,"This is a catastrophe. This is exactly how you ruin a generations' saga. When the entire cinema is LAUGHING at plot twists or supposed to be emotional moments, you just know something went incredibly wrong. And it's no surprise. While FA was an OK remake of the New Hope, as un-creative and as safe as you could possibly expect from a McDonald of cinema, TLJ was abysmally bad writing topped with an agenda of the complexity and depth you'd expect on the high school rally at best. With icing of terrible pacing and plots used to sell the movie's ideas, I had no hopes and no expectations about RoS. And I still came disappointed, to say it very mildly.RoS has in reality a single problem: it is nonsensical in the entire trilogy plot, which disregards two previous movies. We just pretend FA and TLJ didn't ever exist. And it'd be OK as I won't miss or watch the previous movies ever again... IF RoS WAS A FIRST PART OF THE ENTIRE STORY, SETTING THE TRILOGY AND ITS ARCHS, NOT THE FINALE! This of course means that RoS main fault is being an ending to the completely wasted trilogy, but that's exactly how it looks like. There are a bunch of stupid details (dagger, horses... seriously?!) but I might just close one eye if the actual story arcs were decent.And it's a pitty, as there's surely a lot of production value in the movie. It's beautiful. The actions scenes are dense and very well choreographed - I have never seen so seemless show of what force wielders are capable of! The visual development is top notch - the concept deisgn as well as the mood of the scenes are right on spot. VFX are just... WOW!

716,"I'm at the age where I don't want to pay to see a silly movie in the theatre and rather spend it more on the movies that actually does. This movie is silly and ridiculous to me to the point that I could not ignore it. I hate it since I spent money on the thing that I wanted to avoid.I'm just a casual fan. I could understand if somehow it is rated higher because you're a huge fan. But still I can't take it seriously if the rating is more than 5 given the horrendous plot, pacing etc.There's no weight in this movie. Scene changes to another scene to another scene to keep the movie going. There's no structure in the scene and you could feel it is only acted out not because the actors are bad, but what's written for them is bad.The plot and dialogue are cliche as hell and you could see it from miles coming. The characters are just saying things and it really felt scripted and just there to serve. The actions, dialogue, etc. Nothing is earned, it is given. Useless story line, characters and settings.It's really laughable. Some plots are even questionable. Characters just know things, have things without further explanation and it's silly as hell. They tell you things and you just have to accept it because it's supposed to be awesome and what not and because they tell you.It's an empty spectacle and I'm not the one to be swayed just because it's a pretty visual. The movie is pandering to the audience and fans and it is worse at that. Just because it's Star Wars it should not be okay!I'm giving it 2 stars because of very few scenes that I liked. I could feel the weight of that few scenes and it have the potentials to be blossomed into something much better. Instead, it's overshadowed by all of the ridiculous mess from this movie.Screw Reylo. The conclusion to that bond is not earned at all. It feels empty and just a tada! factor in the movie. I wanted that bond to be better and not just for dramatic purposes!To end it in a positive note: Damn, Adam Driver is hot as Kylo Ren in this!

719,"Apart from the cenamatic critique (pacing, mostly poor humor, and character development) the biggest problems with this movie is the story! While I understand that they had a tough battle (no pun intended) to retcon the issues with the last Jedi (and I appreciated the retconing that they did do), they messed up the entire plot of the first 6 films by fundamentally changing how the Force works, and who the chosen one is! This does nothing but undo the entire purpose and all of the sacrifices made in Return of the Jedi!What did I like:Actors did a good job with what they had to work with, the visuals were great (as always), and John Williams soundtrack was phenomenal! Other than that, not much.   I would NOT recommend this movie to a casual movie watcher, let alone real Star Wars fans!!",0
720,"JESUS CHRIST was that a focking sh*t-show. Retrospectively, I guess The Last Jedi didn't leave a lot of open threads hanging for the last movie to tie up, but holy sh*t, there had to be a better way to conclude the most beloved movie franchise of all time than this.The amount of retconning going on from the very first second of the film is INCREDIBLE, deserving probably of a Guiness World Record. Apparently, lots and lots of things have been happening off-screen, in secret, while nobody was looking, for years and decades. There are now also officially no limits anymore to what the force can or cannot enable you to do, it all depends on what is convenient for the plot in that very moment.The pacing is totally off. In the first hour, your head will be spinning from everything that is happening and getting explained to you and you will already feel like you're approaching a finale at the 60 min mark, then the movie goes on for 90 mins more.The writing is simply atrocious. Stupid, cliché-laden one liners are found a-plenty and some conflicts between characters are just conjured up out of thin air because the movie needs some tension and would be boring otherwise. Instead of finding a way to get us to care about the motivations of the main characters we've been following for the entire trilogy, more unnecessary side characters are introduced that serve no real purpose. The plot is extremely predictable and formulaic and the whole affair feels like a giant check-list of things that have to happen, characters that have to appear one more time, call-backs that have to be made, because, you know, this is THE LAST ONE!!! Which I kind of get, but all these things are done in such a heavy-handed and uninspired way that it just makes you roll your eyes. The whole experience feels very much like ""watching a movie"", which is to say, inorganic and not immersive. You as the viewer are constantly aware that everything that happens and is said doesn't arise naturally out of the given circumstances and the characters and their personalities and motivations, but only takes place to fulfill a certain purpose for the plot. I don't know if it is possible to come down much harder on a film's writing than this.""this is THE LAST ONE!!!""Except, now that I think about it, it probably isn't the last one at all, because Disney is going to keep milking this cash cow until there's absolutely no more milk left in its udders and it collapses on the floor from pure exhaustion. And then some more.Conclusion: Please don't waste your money by seeing this in the theater. Even if you're a hardcore Star Wars fan, it'll just break your heart. If I hadn't seen Rambo: Last Blood, this would be my worst movie of the year. 2 points are for the incredible CGI, John Williams' music, and actors that try to make the most of what they've been handed (which isn't much).",0
721,"My beef with the new trilogy is that the directors/writers never sat down together to outline the stories so they would all connect. This seriously hurt this trilogy and it really shows in this movie. Within the first 15 minutes we have an entirely new plot line, which takes a good hour to unpack. There’s explanation upon explanation, even characters thoughts are explained by other characters. At the end of the day this movie is a collage of non stop action sequences. Like an extended trailer that never allows us to really connect with the characters. Rey and Ren have been the most interesting in these movies, but unfortunately their arcs feel rushed robbing the audience of emotional connection and lessening the impact of the grand finale. Normally I see each new Star Wars movie 2-3 times in theaters. Once was enough for this one.",0
722,"I am not a die hard star wars fan. I am, however, a big movie buff. So this is coming from the perspective of someone who is looking at this trilogy in a bubble by itself. That being said, if anyone can explain the mess of contradictions, and new ex machina mechanics I witnessed this evening I would very much appreciate it. It's like they had 12 writers split up and write twelve parts, and then they just mashed it all together. To glue the mess onto a shared board they shoe-horned Palpatine. But hey, that is what I saw. Anyone else who knows more about the lore may be able to correct me.",0
723,"A vapid husk of a Star Wars film, more interested in completing a check-list of vague fan demands from the Internet than it is in having an engaging narrative. Utterly unfulfilling, and the capstone to a trilogy that from day one was more about creating a sellable brand than it was advancing the Star Wars story.",0
724,"This movie is TERRIBLE. There is literally no reason this movie or trilogy exists, but we know why it does: To make money and to please dumb fans who get impressed by the most trivial things. Woah! Palpatine is back! It was very cool that he survived somehow only to be defeated very easily. Definitely cool to watch after the perfect ending that was Return of the Jedi! Like I said, there is NO REASON this movie exists. It is just an much inferior version of the original trilogy's ending. These Disney films can't stand on their own two feet without the original trilogy. I have no attachment to any of the new characters, their character arcs were horrible, this story is horrible. The most insulting thing is that Anakin didn't play a major role. J.J. Abrams said he brought back Palpatine because it wouldn't make sense to not have him in a 9 chapter story, but in that case why didn't you include the MAIN HERO of the prequels who is also the MAIN VILLAIN of the original trilogy? It would have been a powerful moment to have Anakin, who Kylo idolizes, redeem his grandson. Instead we get Han who... appears? Somehow? As a force ghost... I guess? I don't even know. It makes no sense and Anakin would have made much more sense. There's also no reason Kylo Ren should give a **** about Han Solo other than him being his father, it seemed like they have barely any attachment to eachother at all. This movie and this trilogy disrespected Star Wars, and I am disgusted. The main reason this film is bad is due to The Last Jedi not leaving any room for anything else to happen, that movie took steps back so they were forced to dig deep and bring back Palpatine. There is so much **** that is confusing... Palpatine made Snoke? He had clones of Snoke? Why didn't he use multiple Snokes? Does Snoke have a mind of his own? It's not even worth understanding so I won't even try. This trilogy is such a joke, there was no direction and clashing directors. It was a mistake to have JJ direct the last film, it's also a mistake to give the director ALL creative control. This plot in this movie is on par with a sixth graders' terrible, terrible fan fiction. Palpatine should have been easily able to defeat Rey, did they forget he is one of the best lightsaber wielders? Why didn't he push Rey down the pit where he pushed Kylo? Why is Palpatine a one-trick-pony who can only use lightning and didn't even stop using it against Rey when CLEARLY he was dying. So **** stupid. The reason he kept doing it against Mace Windu in the prequels is because he wanted Anakin to help him, but even then he didn't have a lightsaber. Also, why the hell does Palpatine DISINTEGRATE from force lightning just because Rey has two lightsabers? Why does Rey go to a planet the Skywalkers hated and bury Luke and Anakin's lightsabers with a droid that isn't even hers? Why does she call herself Rey Skywalker? Imagine if instead it was: ""Your name's Rey? Where are you from? Oh, you're alone and don't have a people? We'll call you... Rey Solo"" (just making fun at Solo). This is the least satisfying conclusion to a nine part film saga. Return of the Jedi's ending was perfect, the new trilogy has NO VISION. A small nitpick but this film also has the worst soundtrack out of any Star Wars movie, with very little variety as they use the same like 5 themes. If force ghosts can interact with the world, why don't they fight Palpatine? They can cast lightning and lift X-Wings, they're already dead so why the **** don't they fight Palpatine lmao. I was 100% rooting for Palpatine, and I can't imagine why you wouldn't. He is a much better character than the new protagonists, yet Palpatine is a joke in this movie and his plan makes 0 sense. He was for sure an asspull, it's insulting that he survives after Episode 6. The whole point of the first six movies was Darth Vader's redemption. This movie is just a ****ty version of that, with Kylo Ren's redemption after a very forced kiss with Rey. He just disappears lmao. It was a terrible decision to have the SEVENTH MOVIE in a 9 part story be a remake of part 4, while the ninth movie is a remake of the sixth part. We already saw all this **** in Episode 6 but it was actually meaningful, now we have Rey representing all the Jedi that have ever existed... why the hell. That was the whole point of Luke, and he was supposed to rebuild/revive the Jedi, and represent the Last Jedi. Even though they made a movie called ""The Last Jedi""-- you realize he was the Last Jedi in Episode 6??? They were so afraid of the prequel backlash they just remade the same **** story. Episode 8 was so afraid of backlash (albeit it was a small amount) they tried desperately to subvert expectations. After Episode 8 backlash they played it safe like TFA again, and it leads to the least satisfying ending of all time. It would have been neat to have the Jedi back, even if it was just a small number like 15 Jedi. Running out of characters. TLDR; this movie is awful",0
725,"This movie felt like bad fan fiction put together like a bunch of video game side quests.If I ever decide to watch this disaster of a trilogy in one sitting I'm sure it will be the single worst experience of my life.This is a different kind of bad that TLJ was, but its just as bad if not worse.There is probably more lore destroying in this movie than the TLJ did.Disney does not understand STAR WARS, the FORCE, character building, world building, story telling, moving pacing, ANYTHING!!If you are newer SW fan you might like it, but there is no reason older SW fans would like this at all. This is essentially a Marvel type movie with a Star Wars paint job.WTF did I watch!!I am honestly shocked anyone likes this and is trying to defend it and telling people to ignore low score reviews.This movie is at least 2 movies crammed into one, maybe even 3.Some things in this movie would have been okay if they were introduced in EP7 or 8, but how new things were introduced and used was a complete mess!!",0

728,this movie was utter crap. it has shown how incompetent jj abrams and Kennedy are. they did not even bother to do research on the lore or any of the canon star wars material. this movie has done anakin and many of the main characters a disservice. I truly hope this is the last of star wars disney is going to make because it like kicking a dead horse over and over. I cannot watch anymore of this nonsense. do not watch it if you are a true star wars fan. the plot holes in this saga are enormous.,0

730,"What a nightmare!  What happened?  What kind of alternate universe do we live in where Disney owns Star Wars and the Star Wars sequels end up being a complete mess.  The movie title “Rise of Skywalker” is a complete lie since it’s none other than a Palpatine that survives and the Skywalker bloodline is extinguished.  A complete utter disaster.  Unbelievable. How is it that there was no coherent plan for these movies?  How were the sequels passed around to different directors for them to do as they please?  One would think that Disney should have a degree of competence commensurate with such a sacred cultural item - but apparently not.  This is proof that most conspiracy theories, which require extreme competence to be believable, are in fact explained away by the sheer incompetence of those involved.",0

The decisions aren't all bad, but they happen too late for us to care what happens or for characters to fully grasp what is happening. It's a shame because there are lots of potential and new ideas that are worth pursuing, but this movie isn't it.Hopefully Disney learns from this and goes in with a plan next time, as it is clear from these three films that there was not an overarching story for this trilogy. That's on Disney, that's on JJ for turning down the trilogy.At least the prequals are consistent and tell a single story. This series is just a mess with wasted potential.",0
736,"Review Title - The movie that should've been a 6 to 8 45 minute episodes mini series. No spoilers - went to see the epic conclusion last night, had high hopes after seeing how Disney wrapped up the Avengers, but boy was I wrong. Thanks to EP8, EP9 never had a chance to properly tell it's own story, but try to mostly course correct where they wanted to have the story, and not tell a story that evolved out of EP8. Since the very start of the movie, the action, the dialogue, the interactions and even actors emotions needed to be rushed or dulled just to get to the next thing. Small things that are totally blown out of proportions and in the end don't matter at all or don't even impact the story midway movie on. It is quite very apparent that there have been reshoots done, as the final result is basically just pieced together out of these small sections only to advance the story. It feels more like a entire season of a series (like the Mandalorian) just pieced together and call it a movie. Breaking down the entire plot scene by scene would have yielded overall a better series with the same story, leaving maybe more time for tensions and emotions to really take over; have a true impact made by some decisions in the movie, as some don't even matter 2 scenes later. As it is right now, action packed, dull, rushed and predictable character development in a single movie, lack of impact on half of the decisions everyone makes, and a somewhat unpleasant wrap up makes this movie the ""I should have been a short mini series or 2 part movie to begin with"".",0
737,"This movie has many flaws that plenty of Youtube reviews will mention in great detail. But the biggest reason I can't stand this movie is because it undoes Lucas's Star Wars Saga. ***SPOILERS***They make Rey the chosen one and undo everything that came before. Anakin is not in this movie and if there's no Anakin then there was no chosen one. I do not buy Rey being the chosen one. Nor do I accept the fact that she identifies as a Skywalker. This movie is a mess, a disgrace and a total disappointment. This Disney Trilogy is not canon in my eyes.I'll give it a 2 because it's not as painful to watch as TLJ is but it's not a better film by any means.",0

This movie is a sh*t sandwich. No matter what Disney may say in their hopes for more filthy lucre, this series is done, there's no going back. One company single handedly decimated an entire franchise and legacy with its greed and pandering. This movie is bull****, and I want my money back. I hope George is proud of himself for selling out. Your prequels weren't great, but they were high Shakespeare compared to this crass tripe. I long for the halcyon days of Jar-Jar. The film is unwatchable, even as a non-Star Wars film - that is a low that is difficult to achieve. So bravo, Disney, on making the dregs of abject sewage something attainable for all of us. Pathetic, in the extreme. Everyone involved in this should be ashamed of themselves.As an aside, it's no surprise that first twenty or so reviews are 'tens' showering praise and that falls off immediately afterward. You aren't fooling anyone, Disney (and other studios should take note), and the critics need to check themselves, big time. This was not a good film. It was an absolutely *terrible* Star Wars film. I'm no cynic - I appreciate good film making. This was the opposite of that. That it is supposedly 'Star Wars' makes it doubly insidious. Go to the fiery place, Disney.",0

Security is also a non-existing concept there.The props are surprisingly cheap, the dagger obviously 3D-printed, and the mysterious navigation device has a small LED inside. Why do I see that? Where did the budget gone?The movie is also boring and slow, and dialogues are insipid. They could fit that all in an hour, and save us that **** dialogue and all the face play.

There is no build up, it simply happens. When Vader turned to the good side it was done by great cinematography (seeing Luke being torturedby the emperor etc.).

Screw Disney they are messing up everything they  touch next will be the new phase of marvel. The worst part was the action then the story plot/ story not to mention they barely had kylo do anything in the end take him out and what would change. Sad but cruelly I hope this is the last time disney even thinks of making a woke version of star wars not even sure if they should attempt another even if they promised to make it more of what it should of been they are empty just like there words would be so **** that.,0

We have Jedi ... who strike in anger, murder people by the tens of thousands, and yet aren't tempted by The Dark Side.  The Force has ceased to be a spiritual energy, and is instead a social media dating app for the main characters.  They reach across the stars to other planets to contact people ... and pull objects back!  They pull starships from the sky, heal wounds, and even bring people back from the dead ... and not as force ghosts.  I mean a major character dies and then is brought back to life by the force without any explanation of how this miracle was suddenly possible.  Characters killed in previous films are suddenly alive and in the flesh with little explanation of how or why.  Characters with zero established force power suddenly have the power to return as force ghosts, despite this being a force power first used by Qui Gon.  A character is suddenly revealed to be a jedi knight, with zero build-up to hint how or when or why this happened, nor why this character has only shown the merest hint of force control before.  Apparently, now, people simply KNOW how to use the force with zero training.  Once again, we have a trope wherein an entire fleet may be destroyed by destroying one vulnerable target.  What?  What idiot keeps making this mistake?  Again, we have planet-destroying weapons ... but they're barely an afterthought.  We have a cavalry that suddenly rides to the rescue on a moment's notice with no more explanation than ""I'm going to go get help!""  We have dropped plotlines, unfulfilled plotlines, and wasted opportunities, characters introduced and then immediately dropped, almost no character development for anybody.  AND (spoiler alert) Kylo Ren and Rey get to kiss at the end.  Yup.  He can massacre people, kill his parents, destroy whole planets, and torture Rey, but he's hot, so I guess it's okay.  What a f'd up movie!  I'm glad this was the end.",0

And she came back in, and the audience' collectively tuned out, in a flurry of disappointment.Remember when they jumped into hyperspace and destroyed the ship? And while that looked cool... that isnt how the series worked. You cant just introduce 'fuel' and hyperspace suicide runs like that!Needless to say, the first 10 minutes includes one of those kinds of ... 'franchise ruiner' scenes. Within the next 3 minutes you will see the other one. Not even 15 minutes in, and we are staring down two facepalm scenes and the action is REALLY badly paced. Jumping.. literally.. from scene to scene, within the scene, within space, within the story. Just too fast, too much to take in. Too much happening ~ and THERE ISNT EVEN ANYTHING HAPPENING!We get a terrible space battle, a terrible confrontation and a heavy-handed training montage.Now all of these things aside, it can be forgiven because it was expected.Is it the SW that you know and love? No. Is it a modern day masterpiece? No.Is it a lot of fan service, a lot of pandering to new audiences and an action fest? Yes.That is.. very expected, and that is okay.What is NOT okay is that it feels like work to watch this. You dont go into this with a sensee of awe, you watch it because you feel like you have to. You know what else felt like work? Avengers endgame. But it overcomes that and entertains within the first 5 minutes.As a series finale, I highly recommend you wait until its available at home. I feel like if I could pause this, walk away, sigh and drink a beer.. it might be better paced than being forced to watch this as a whole. One sitting is too much.",0

845,"Biggest movie disappointment of all time for the greatest movie franchise of all time. What Episodes 7 & 8 were building was completely kicked to the curb with a total mess & blur of a movie for Episode 9. JJ Abrams should be ashamed of himself. For anyone to claim that this movie was a good ending for the revered 42 years of Star Wars movies is an idiot. Nothing less than amazing as the original Star Wars was going to cut it. And throwing in a bunch of nostalgia is not amazing... it is lazy & shows lack of creativity. So not only should JJ be ashamed but Disney should be begging all fans for forgiveness for ruining the greatest human story that has ever been seen on the screen. I hope Disney feels good at destroying a fantastic story and modern storytelling legend. The Sequel Triology is now so bad that all fans who criticized George Lucas for the Prequel Triology should now be realizing just how awesome those movies were. George was right, the Skywalker saga ended with Episode 6 back in 1983. I am fairly sure I could have lived without ever having Episodes 7 to 9. Whatever was dangled in front of us after The Farce (oops!) Force Awakens was not fulfilled as I would not call the Sequel Triology a fairy tale as was alluded to after Episode 7. I didn't even pick up on the REYLO hints until YouTube pointed them out and THEN I was excited for the next 2 movies. But nope, they didnt get better... they got worse. However, Episodes 7 & 8 had pretty good story development & continuity (except for the casino planet part in Episode 8). But Episode 9 moves so fast that most of the time I wasn't sure where the movie was or why. REYLO was the only potentially redeeming quality for the whole Triology... and yet it was screwed up after great potential... so that all fans were satisfied. I am sorry, but a 15 second kiss with a smile & laugh from Ben followed by out anti-hero/here dying was the biggest farce and scam pulled on a set of fans. Shame on JJ for bowing to Disney pressure to satisfy all fans and satisfying none. He is really going to have to do a great movie after this one in order to redeem himself as a great director. After 2 weeks, the movie is a blur in my mind and makes no sense. I have no emotional attachment to it other than negative. BOOOOOOOOO! BOOOOOOO! BOOOOOO! You had LOVE & you let it go! (A reference from a really great fairy tale movie THE PRINCESS BRIDE.) I will not repeat watch the Sequel Triology. It is a total waste of time with no emotional payoff. Hey! Yeah, maybe you movie makers out there should remember that great stories/movies create an emotional investment in the audience. BOOOOOOO! BOOOOOOO! BOOOOOOO! Throws rotten tomatoes at JJ Abrams & Disney. You cheated us & I want my money back!!!!!",0
847,I’m not really sure why Disney made the decision to grant Rey with the ability to control the force to the extent she does in the 3 films she is in but it absolutely destroys anything previously in Star Wars films.

So apparently Luke only managed to kill Vader, neto! Rey that was a nice cool character up until now, really becomes boring. The only merit of the film is ""rescuing"" a burned Kylo Ren character.",0
853,"Mild Spoilers involved:  Just not a very good movie in general.  I agree with many of the critics for once, the powers that be seemed to concentrate more on clicking boxes, and making Rey the savior of, well, everything and everyone, rather than tell a good story.  The one good element was that the acting was superb for the most part.  They just did not have much to work with.  It was beyond predictable, and half way through I was just ready for Rey to kill 'you know who' already, so I could be done.  The interesting and exceedingly frustrating miss is that the story screamed for a huge twist that would have really cemented a lasting legacy for the franchise.  In the almost year leading up to the premiere, there were minor hints of a possibility that Rey could fall to the Dark Side at some point.  Though as more trailers revealed this was probably not going to happen, it would have made for a great plot choice, with endless possibilities.  (1) Rey falls, Kylo is redeemed and must stop her.  (2) Rey falls and Finn becomes a Jedi to stop her, perhaps with Kylo.  (3) Even Rey falls, but is ultimately redeemed .  Any of these options and more would have really opened up the story more.  It also would have solved another glaring problem with the trilogy as a whole.  I like most everyone, thought the prequels were pretty bad, but I believe this was more due to poor acting than anyone cares to admit.  But what I loved about “Attack of the Clones” and “Revenge of the Sith” was the multiple Jedi, and to a certain extent Sith, we were able to witness.  This was something even the original trilogy did not have, though I will admit, those movies were certainly fine cinema at its best on their own.  In any case it would have been great to see more than just Rey and Kylo in every movie.  Luke, Leia, and the Emperor had mere moments of battle, plus they were all known characters, and old by this time.  It would have been great to see Finn explore his abilities, Snook not dispatched so quickly and in action, and perhaps a couple of others.  I was genuinely tired of the Rey/Kylo fight, love, whatever, before the last movie even started.  O.K. my rant is done, maybe we’ll get this and more in the next trilogy…",0
855,Oh boy where do I even begin with this catastrophe from just the beginning to end it was rushed and crammed in with so much stuff. The entire movie had to make up for the countless mistakes TLJ made and honestly this was bound to fail from just the beginning. When you realize the sheer amount of potential and story they had... and somehow destroyed it is just BEYOND me its mind blowing. They really should have planned these films out and did better story building because everything was just rushed. The conclusions for each character were terrible and half assed. Somehow they literally trashed Luke and Anakin Skywalker story as if everything they did was for absolutely nothing. Also wtf was the point of finally adding in the Knights of the Ren and they didn't do A DAMN THING?!? Wth lol what was this abysmal movie? I never thought I could ever dislike Star Wars more than I do now and as a fan not even a hater or a troll I am beyond disappointed and sad....,0

Expectations subverted! Not only didn't he try to write a half-way decent film, but he apparently decided that instead of trying to polish the, uh ...

By far. Don't give me Plan Nine From Outer Space! This is worse. A wooden Mary Sue who has stolen everything, and then she has the gall to call herself Skywalker when she is the granddaughter of Palpatine.Palpatine won, folks.

877,"Where to start with this dumpster fire of a movie? Let's talk about the legacy of Rian Johnson that looms large over this last installment of this franchise. Rian Johnson effectively ended the trilogy one film earlier by killing off the character of Luke Skywalker, by killing off the main overarching villain and by killing off the entire trilogy story in TLJ. This means that J J Abrams has now inherited what can only be described as a wheezing, lurching and asthmatic dumpster fire of what could have otherwise been one of the best endings to one of the most beloved franchise stories in cinematic history. It is apparent, through the lack of plot, the lack of characterization, the need to introduce new characters at this late stage (why???) and through the return of Palpatine, that J J Abrams has found himself in a tight corner that, itself, contains even more smaller corners than his beloved mystery box. The plot, such as it is, does not exist in any compelling way. It is, literally, the cinematic equivalent of a 16 bit endless runner game. Point A to point B to point X, Y and Z. The first half is a 'Get this McGuffin' then 'Go there for this McGuffin' plot. And, somehow, it fails at this too. The character of Rey (Daisy RIdley), being so OP, still has no idea of what it is like to properly fail at doing something...anything...even once. She inherits the unearned mantle of 'Skywalker' through choice, not through any suffering or trials that would seriously test her. She manages to defeat the Emperor in her first, only and VERY brief encounter with him. It is an unfitting and ignoble end to the character of Luke Skywalker as well as that of Emperor Palpatine. It also takes a huge dump over the mythos of Star Wars to have the Emperor return. Much like the rest of the sequel trilogy, there is little of anything new here. The Rise of Skywalker is a poor man's Return of The Jedi. If you like watching movies that punch you in the face until you're numb with exposition and still don't make sense, if you like watching movies where the requirement is that you don't have to care about any of the characters to get to the end of an engorged run time and, if you like watching movies where the stakes are so minimal because it's literally just a race to the closing credits, then you'll enjoy this film. I can't and won't tell you to save your cash and boycott this film. But, BOY...do I like COTS...",0

884,"Horrific. Truly. JJ Abrams didn't make a film. He made a trailer that is almost three hours long. It's not homage, as some reviewers have gamely claimed: it's pastiche, merely drawing elements from past films for a second or two before dropping them inexplicably and racing on. It's clear that Abrams believes that hyperactive plotting should suffice to distract his viewers from bad writing and bad directing. Take just one element from TLJ - the fight between Rey and Kylo on one side vs Snoke's Guard. That was a beautifully paced and choreographed battle, with exquisite cinematography. You'll find nothing comparable in TROS: all group lightsaber fights are scrappy affairs that are over in a few clumsy seconds.Before TROS came out I joked with friends that the unimaginative Abrams would probably come up with some new version of the Death Star the way he did in TFA. I was kidding, and yet that's basically what he's done with 10,000 Star Destroyers that magically now each have the power to blow up entire planets. Guess those Death Star, Death Star 2 and Starkiller Base designers were just idiots. Plus it turns out no-one really dies, ever. The Emperor didn't die, so I guess all those great feelings we had at the end of TROTJ were misplaced. Kylo gets stabbed and hey presto, turns out Rey has magically learned how to revive people, so he gets better. Then Rey dies and hey presto again, turns out Kylo who's just been thrown into an energy pit can really take a punch so he's okay, gets up and revives Rey. Oh but then he dies, and Rey doesn't try to help him. Because...she's a dick? Who knows? It just goes on. Mindless cameos, including by JJ's idiot fat friend who he inflicts on audiences of all his works just because he can. We're supposed to care about Poe and Finn, even though they probably both should have been killed in TFA and are insipid cardboard characters. Forest troopers suddenly show up in a desert environment because research is hard, I guess. Stormtroopers still have no aim. The series took a wrong turn with Episode VI, and I, II and III were weird and dull. But VII, VIII and IX should have been the moment to shine for a new generation of writers and directors. I'm one of those people who liked VIII because it at least tried to go in some newer and more interesting directions. But the two JJ movies ought to be burnt and purged from the canon.

They winged it from start to finish thinking they could get away with it and - to nobody's shock - they miserably failed to stick the landing.",0

Nothing is given a proper explanation, every answer is just another question that will never be fulfilled.

903,"A mindless, objectively badly written popcorn flick with great visuals, good acting in places that just doesn't make sense. It's a horrible attempt at a sequel to 8 other movies that this one tried to follow, but rather undermines in an attempt to claw back some of the lost fans of the previous episode. Also tried to push it's own agenda more than use proper storytelling. The whole thing feels like a stuffed together frankenstein that robots and ai tried to make in a lab.",0
904,"Star Wars: Episode IX - Because the Force. This movie would have been legitimately better if no other Star Wars movie existed. The plot holes in The Rise of Skywalker undermines not only it's own plot, but it undermines previous Star Wars movies. The acting is decent, there are some aesthetically cool environments, but the writing and plot holes are just terrifically bad. There are a few cool moments within this movie, but they are overshadowed by the terrible plot holes/devices this movie uses to reach its conclusion. It feels like J.J. Abrams just wanted to finish this trilogy, and slapped whatever he could together to finish the final movie.",0
905,"The Rise of Skywalker is a problematic movie. The movie suffers from a myriad of issues mostly centred around its plot(which was close to non existant). The first half of the movie felt extremely disjointed, as if the director found out he needed to trim the movie down in length, and did so by cutting part of the begging and ending off pretty much each of the scenes. It also suffers from what I consider to be convenience writing. Our heroes would have a major issues and then poof, there was a solution that just appeared. This happened again and again, and really did a number on the narrative tension, it really felt like no matter what happened something would just happen and give our heroes a out.  Another key issue I had was that the dialog felt lacking, I am attributing this to the fact that it felt like part of each scene was missing.The movie did have a couple good points.  The acting was good for what each actor and actress were given(not much).  The visuals were stunning and John Williams sound track is still one of my all time favourites. But unfortunately these three things are not enough to make up for the lack of substance in any way shape or form.I just cant give my recommendation to go see it. While some I am sure will enjoy the movie for the top tier visual effects, it is far too flawed for anyone who cares about the worldbuilding and story to enjoy in any meaningful way.",0
906,"Complete laughing stock of the franchise. Never cared for The Force Awakens, hated Last Jedi, and absolutely loath this movie. Painstakingly sat through it. Never again.

907,"The film reads like a fanfiction, Disney should have saved their money and published the script under a false name. Terrible lines and poor acting from the characters; too many characters in rushed scene transitions that left little time for the audience to feel relief. The film rewrites the ‘Last Jedi’ reveals and introduces the ridiculous concept of Rey being a Palpatine- a stupid line repeated too many times. Hollywood must think we’re idiots to be satisfied with some wholesome experience that’ll restore the lacklustre profits that they’re currently receiving. The more subtable title would be: “the last piece of amateur writing Hollywood produces to rape Star Wars”, at least for 2020.",0

911,"I need to vent, so spoilers below, bigly...>>>>>>>>>>>>Seriously, do something different, folks...for all of it's faults (and there were many) regarding The Last Jedi, at least it told a story and emotionally engaged me - a Rebellion on the brink, Luke turning inward, Rey learning the ropes, the kinda love thing between Rose and Finn, Poe learning that ""them b*tches"" maybe know what they're doing so he should sit tight for a sec and wait for orders, the ghost Luke fight at the end...solid stuff (I'm going to skirt around the B-Plot as it paid off at the very end, but MAN it took awhile to get there; also not a fan of the random Benicio Del Toro betrayal with no payoff, because why? And probably some more sht.)But this...THIS was just fan service.  And the worst kind of fan service - fan service for fans that are too damned old to be listened to. It's like a 50 year old man walking into ""Batman Begins"" and saying ""well, Tim Burton did it better so RAAAAGE!""I don't even know where to begin with all of the repetitive, recycled plot points and set pieces here, but here goes:-Palpatine is the bad guy....AGAIN. FOR THE NINTH MOVIE, because apparently for the 7th and 8th ""he'd been there all along"" (weird how we never saw him or got a hint...he's THAT good)-Rey finds out she was lied to about her parents and that she's a descendant of a powerful dark side user...but the lie was TRUE ""from a certain point of view...""-She finds this out from her nemesis, almost preparing to leap to her death to escape before the Falcon rescues her-The final scenes are in the Endor system...on the Death Star...IN THE EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM-The hero uses a lightsaber to block force lightning attacks...oh, wait, she has TWO...RIGHT.  Totes different.  Oh, while a space battle rages outside-This fleet of planet killing ships will all be vulnerable if a commando team can engage in a land battle to take our the mcguffin of a shield thingee whatever-Lando leads an armada that saves the day at the end, but has virtually no plot impact for most of the movie-The ""bad guy"" sacrifices himself to save the hero at the end (the one tiny saving grace is that he didn't ""save her"" because that would have been a bridge too far)This is a movie that was exactly what the fans who hated TLJ wanted and it's awful because of it.  Somehow it had only slightly MORE soul than Solo, which is the only reason this gets a 3 out of 10, because Solo is the very bottom, a 0 out of 10, full stop.Prediction: when we look back years from now, the second installment of this trilogy will be held up as the best of the lot. And I'm not even a Rian Johnson fanboy (and I actually LOVE JJ Abrams work..usually), but Johnson's Star Wars standalone trilogy is the only thing that can possibly save this franchise theatrically, at this point - something far removed from the Skywalker/Solo/Kenobi/Palpatine mess...this should be the end of that story and these characters forever.  You'll have more fun watching ""The Mandalorian..."" which is excellent.  This was not - go see ""Parasite"" instead...",0

913,"Horrible pacing, lore breaking, rey being a Mary Sue . This is quintessentially a Disney star wars film.",0
914,This movie had so much potential and they completely missed the mark. FailIng to mention the people Kylo Ren fights in the beginning are Vader cultists just comes off like they wanted to make him look like a massive dick one more time. Plot is fast paced and all over the place. It’s hard to keep track of what’s going on and why. But most importantly they killed Ben Solo. They kept on and on for three movies about how Rey and Ben are equals and how they balance each other. Then they introduce the fact they are a dyad and tied together. For what? Ben’s dead and now there’s an imbalance again. And speaking of dying. Why did anyone have to die at the end? The last Skywalker dead for no reason. The lonely girl who wanted a family ends up alone again and without the person she loves. And then Rey just taking the Skywalker name? For what? Oh and for everyone saying that he died just like his grandfather Vader did. You’re missing the point. Ben was trying to be someone he wasn’t and to have him die like that was stupid. At least Vader got a memorial and we saw his force ghost smiling with the others at the end.What an absolute waste and piece of trash.,0
915,"Complete garbage writing and an insulting way to end the series. First off, they try to pretend the last movie never happened and cram multiple movies into one. Remember the characters you met in Last Jedi? Well, they have nothing to do in this one. That's just problem ONE. I don't know why JJ Abrams seems so obsessed with 'fake out' deaths, but to get the audience emotional about losing Chewie (which would have been a good plot device at giving Rey a flaw) and C-3PO only to go 'oh, wait, no, they're just fine!' a couple minutes later...this plot relies heavily on those kinds of coincidences. They just HAPPEN to find the dagger they need, they just HAPPEN to be standing in just the right spot, they just HAPPEN to realize the force can suddenly heal people. Oh, and, the emperor is back. Somehow he lived through being thrown into the death star core and being blown up. And it all just kinda takes place off screen at the beginning to no ones surprise. Just like everyone knew all along that Rey was a Palpatine (except Rey of course).Save your money...this whole movie just plays out like bad fanfiction.",0
917,Worst starwars movie even worse than the force awakens.  I didn't think it was possible but JJ out did himself.  He sunk the franchise even lower than before.,0
918,"The editing was so fast I swear I got whiplash. It felt like a series of 1 minute scenes. At one point when the crew is trying to escape Kylo, for some reason Ray goes outside and Finn tells Chewy to go get her. Chewy gets immediately captured and then killed. Not 5 minutes later does the movie then go ""No Chewy is alive you silly babies haha got you"". It felt like a slap in the face. I walked out.",0
919,"The film production felt extremely rushed, as if they just wanted to hurry and end the main saga. I hate how they killed off Ben. His character development was good, but as it barely reached its peak, he died. His death felt like it was too soon, and straight up out of place. I'd love if the saga continued with them bringing Ben back.",0

922,"I was a fan of the previous two films in this trilogy, but this movie really didn't know what to do with itself. The front half suffers from serious pacing issues, and the back half doesn't feel like it has meaningful stakes. There are a lot of attempts to 'correct' 'problems' from TLJ, but the film does its best just to ignore the previous entry.In the first 30 minutes of the movie, I'm not sure that the average time between cuts is higher than about 4 seconds. It moves all over the place and doesn't let you settle until the movie is well underway.Don't waste your time. Go watch the Mandolorian instead.",0
923,"Worst of all the films in the entire franchise. Plot- didn’t make sense, the writing - was just poor, the grand reveal - was just a massive WTF, scenes that just didn’t fit - LOTS! So many odd sequences that just didn’t belong. It’s almost as if 6 different people wrote scripts for this film and then JJ just took random pages from each one. To say this film was terrible is an understatement. It left me disgusted with Disney for what they have to the franchise. I never want to see this film ever again. I’m just gonna pretend it never happened and say the last film was RotJ.",0

926,A terrible ending to a terrible sequel trilogy. Brings nothing new and the new characters are as bland as ever. Bringing back the Emperor undermines the original trilogy. Riddled with plot holes.

This movie had no purpose apart from luring people into the cinemas and making money off people by presenting them a rushed movie with a shambolic plot that’s masked with non stop CGI. It’s just full of cheese and butter without any taste of flavour.",0

I was obvious it would go wrong... this movie is an insult to the rest of the saga, undoing ""the return of the Jedi ""just to put on a party revenge against ""the last jedi"". Really a shame that Disney is more concerned about creating a movie that will fill their pockets than producing a story worth telling.",0
932,"Another remake. This is a remake trilogy.A bad film, with many things without explanation, jedi powers have become like Marvel superpowers.I'm speechless..1) In episode 6, didn't Palpatine's body incinerate, neither after falling into the core of black death,  or following the explosion of black death itself? Impossible.2) If they introduce the power to teleport objects, I expect that introduced any power, such as making disappear stars , creating planets, .....3)  With the exception of those who manage to transform into Force ghost , when a jedi dies he loses his identity.Obi Wan in episode 6 said he can't interfere with the events, so it's impossible that they spent their energies on Rey.As a result I stopped following the current canon, I only follow the star wars products prior to 2014 and I ignore everything else.A sentence summarizes all the things that there would be to say: George Lucas did not participate in the Premier of this film.",0

935,Dark side < power of feminism The worst Star Wars movie I v ever seen.Shame.,0
936,I liked Billy Dee Williams as Lando. He had the same energy as he did back in the OT. What is sad is the fact that he's probably the only OT character other than C3PO to really feel like the same character. Han was a deadbeat dad and Luke was Jake Skymilker on suicide watch (oops he did kill himself). This whole trilogy is cultural graffiti created by nihilist and greed. We miss you George and I'm sorry for making fun of the prequels if that led to this abomination.,0
937,Not good even worst than the last Jedi. Imagine liea knew she was a palpatine all along.she knew Ben was going to die. Rey is overpowered.finn suddenly is force sensitive. The pacing is choppy.Everyone including tico was a waste of time. The force ghost can catch light sabers. Worst of all they copied marvels end game ending. Everyone hyperspaced when Poe felt all was lost and Rey saying I am ....all the Jedi. Does palpatine force lightening avoid his star destroyers alone. Does force lightening have an automatic switch cause he could have stopped when Rey was deflecting it with her two sabers. How did chewie survive the ship which Rey forced lighteninged it to smithereens. Why did a sith wavefinder(dis is crap)lie unscathed in the second deathstar. about that death star how does it still have power to open the door to the second wave or wayfinder aka holocron. The list of gripes go on and on. Felt like a video game treasure hunt. They should have split the movie in two parts ..two develop the characters and explore the force powers more. Finn yet again was nothing much he should have been the protagonist and Rey the sith empress to be. What a waste.,0
938,"Your “scenario” was completely merged and in detail a year ago, six months later it was distributed across all social networks. And absolutely nobody liked him, considering him nonsense written under drugs ....Weighted by the death of Palpatine, the First Order is destroyed? I doubt it ... Who can guarantee that another First Order or Empire will not appear ??? ..Many characters were introduced, and the old ones were not revealed at all. I would like to ask a question, but for what many of them were needed? For a couple of seconds?I liked in episode 8 that Rian wanted to do BALANCE.  He liked the idea of ... ""grayness."" He, unlike Abrams, did not divide everything into black and white.He shot his eighth episode, and struck out the Rian episode from the plot. I can not call it professionalism ...Also, if you look at Abrams’s interview on the film itself, I can confidently say that we were told about the completely opposite plot .. In fact, it was a lie to the fans to attract the audience ...You understand that they stuck a dagger in the heart of many people. You have brought children and adults to tears and tantrums. It is absurd that the 40-year-old saga ended with the destruction of all Skywalkers. Then what was its meaning?Do not teach yourself and your children that death is the only form of atonement. It is not right! The stories told in this way are terrible, they do not teach anything and do not give any hope! Directors and screenwriters should stop doing this...",0

They never destroyed him. The Fellowship was not successful. They failed.'Because that's exactly what they've done here with the Star Wars mythology. So they failed to destroy Sauron. Sauron's back, he's been waiting in hiding the whole time. Don't ask me how this makes any sense, it just does. And there's another villain in the meantime who's cropped up, we'll call him Snauron. And Snauron is actually a puppet of Sauron. And again, don't ask how any of this makes sense. It just does, ok it just does?

How? When?"" wasn't he tossed down an elevator shaft and an explosion that followed afterwards?Didn't the Death Star explode to a million bits along with Palpatine? Are we being lead to believe that he was alive this whole time?The mindless set pieces are everywhere, there is little danger to the new characters, I know that in Star Wars there's plenty of plot armor, but these people have so much plot armor that they are worth a Cyberdyne factory, the whole Palpatine fleet has Death Star cannons, and if that's not enough, the entire fleet relies on one control tower, and then one ship to take off, then a whole bunch of people show up and it makes you wonder, where was this Rebel fleet during Episode VII or VIII?! it's just candy to keep the audience entertained.The plot of this movie is so forced, the characters don't drive the plot, the plot drives the characters, it's MacGuffin after MacGuffin, the pacing and editing is too fast, it's scene, scene, scene, scene, objects seem to teleport all over the place, there is enough to make the audience confused rather than intrigued.This is a total retcon of The Last Jedi, it wanted to please everyone, keep some of what made The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens, it ended up pleasing no one. This is the worst Star Wars film ever made, and every time I watch Batman and Robin or Superman III, I will do it with my subconcious telling me: It could of been a hell of a lot worse.This movie will serve as an example of that kind of worse, it's bad fan fiction, but what offends me is that people were actually paid to write this movie, what a waste of time and money.

I thought the dark era of films was behind us, I thought we had finally reached the age where films didn't give white people such a high percentage of screen time, I was wrong. This film featured far too many white people and my black wife was appalled by Kylo Ren's nasty caveman like appearance, Ren clearly needed some dark chocolate on his body to of made him far less intimidating.I hated how Finn kept kinda begging Rey to be her boyfriend, it's making us black people out like we love whites sexually which for the most part isn't true. Also Finn should've been less productive in this film as non-blacks do most of the work that keeps civilisation running and us blacks thrive off non-whites superior intellectual capacity in much the same way a dog thrives off the generosity of it's domesticated highly intelligent Human owner.

959,This movie is a total piece of garbage. Don't waste your time or money on this dumpster fire.,0
960,I am no longer a starwars fans. The writing in this movie is a mess with no understanding of the starwars lore.,0
961,"A movie quite chaotic in the first part, with a lot of plot holes, and so many things are not explained. Fan service is so poor, you can see they just decided to show references like ewoks, lando (that is so useless as a character, like Leia, but he also has a cringe moment in the end), or the final scene with all the jedi talking to rey, they could have added the shadows of all of them and of all the siths to create an amazing final battle.",0
962,This movie is plain offensive and a disgrace to the original trilogy and it’s creator George Lucas. Further turns Luke into a failure only to have overpowered Rey who has not earned anything right all of the wrongs. Worst movie I have ever seen. If you are a real Star Wars fan DO NOT spend your money and save yourself the disappointment.,0
963,"Little to no character development. I didn't buy any of the attempts at chemistry among the characters, thus the moments which are supposed to provide an emotional payoff just fall flat. Feels like it was written by a fan who is banking on nostalgic responses from the audience. The sound and visuals are top notch. Kylo Ren has a decent moment, and C3P0 says the only funny line in the movie. That's about it.",0
964,"This is not a movie, not a saga, not a space opera. This is comics, way different type of art. And there is nothing from Star Wars except visual style and several characters. It is sad that this story ended up like this. This was a huge mistake to ask mister J.J. Abrams to create this. Unfortunately his vision of Star Wars became another Star Track series in the Star Wars universe. Watching all these three movies I`ve tried to get this feeling ... ""A long time a go in a galaxy, far far away."" And - NO. Nothing in return. And I won`t agree with Solo family storyline. One time movie. And please, mister J.J. Abrams - stop thinking that having awesome visuals can make a win win movie.",0
965,Very disappointed. There wasn't much about this movie that seemed real or even slightly believable. So much hurried rehash of old star wars plots with ZERO of the old magic. This acurately should have been called fall of Skywalker or the final death of star wars. This will go down as one of the most epic fails in movie history.,0
966,A truly flawed and dumb movie.It would have been easy to avoid this. Unnecessary physics and logic defying nonsense makes one wonder if the creator lacks intelligence or if that is suspected of the audience.Just one example: thousands of star destroyers with the same planet destroying power as a Death Star. There is a reason so much time and resources were spent to crate a battle platform the size of a moon...and then a even bigger light side force jumps in....it even hurts to write about this idiotic plot....,0
967,"The Rise of Skywalker is a compromised movie with enormous plotholes. This is what happens when there is no real clear vision and no original imagination. JJ Abrahams took ideas which where used in the Dark Empire comics from the early 90-ies. In that series the Emporer survived his fall and his Dark life energy was collected and put inside a clone body where he was young again. Luke was turned to the Dark Side and commanded the Eclipse which was a Massive Super StarDestroyer with DeathStar fire power. That was basicly what've we've got in the Rise of Skywalker only badly excecuted and details were changed so it wasn't an exact copy. In TROS there was no explanation at all how the Emporer survived, we just should except it?! There were good parts in the movie but the final battle with the massive fleet was just garbage. There was no real sense of danger, emotion or purpose. By the end of the movie i felt very empty. WTF did i just watched?! They had the chance to make a magical movie with an open ending but they chose this path. In the end we've got a rushed, fake and empty feeling movie which insulted the original movies and true Star Wars fans.",0
968,"Depressiv and meaningless ending of a Saga. 40 years of suffering from a whole family for nothing.A story with 1 dimensional characters and no logical background. No time for talking, grieving, developing. One action sequence chasing the next. All for a few good views.If you don't think to much the movie might be good and entertaining. But a soon as you want more as stupid fights and actions you are in the wrong movie.The concept of balance, the Grey are forgotten. Back to good vs evil. No deep dialoges. Star wars should be a fairy tale, but this movie was a tragedy. No hope left. The end of a Saga in ashes. A fairytale which left 2 kids in my cinema crying like hell. What's wrong disney?",0
969,"JJ Abrams does to Star Wars what he did to Star Trek. Overall The Rise of Skywalker gives a rushed story and sidelines everyone except Rey. Instead of building on the previous film, JJ rapidly introduces new characters that ultimately had no impact to the story. Important events were either changed, ignored, or outright retconned for shock value and the breakneck pace of the film gave little time for characters to stop and process what was going on.Cameos from original favorites was an attempt to invoke nostalgia and Abrams' attempt to please all sides of a divided fandom fails spectacularly as he and Kathleen Kennedy undermine the message of hope that Star Wars is supposed to be about. Ultimately, this movie is a bad fanfiction from Reddit. Don't waste your time or money on this underwhelming conclusion. If you must see it, wait for the DVD release.",0
976,Даже накрученные отзывы не спасают эту помойку!После лукаса смотреть это не возможно!,0
977,Wow. At the first minutes I understood that this movie was going to be completely thrash. It's like a 2 hours ADHD rush on amphetamine... You never cares for anyone because no time to feel or think. It's only 3 star wars movies for me now 4-5-6.,0
978,"Don't trust the Rotten Tomatoes audience score. It is doctored. Horrible conclusion to an awful trilogy. The damage done by TLJ is unrepairable. Disney had no plan, no vision, no guts and now they're paying the price for it.Is it really a 2/10 movie? Nah. More like 4/10. But I've scored it lower as a countermeasure for Disney's paid reviews and bots.",0

982,"Disney has got to be the worst thing that ever happened to Star Wars. The people involved in the making of this film as well as the last Jedi as stupid and retarded beyond belief. Everything is rehashed old material, proving the creative (and moral) bankruptcy of Hollyweird. Not to mention the forced diversity, the forced feminism etc...and worst of all the LESBIAN trash that is forced onto the public. This is not Star Wars, it's ANTIFA soy boys and lesbian feminist man haters trying to force their agenda, using an old gravy train that their rich corporate bosses purchased.Like all old remakes and new films copying old recipes, this incoherent, repetitive, unimaginative piece of dog excrement is feminist to the core and takes essentially male characters and roles and transfers them to feminist ""wamen"" on a silver plate. Rey's character is so stupid and obviously part of a feminist agenda to say girls can do everything and anything without having to work for it, it's not even funny. And the human feces working at Disney had to validate it by using an old cliche and making Rey into Palpatine's grand-daughter. Hollywood is not only a morally defunct cess pool of LMNOP weirdos and purple haired freaks (like Admiral Haldo and her gender studies look) but it's FORCED diversity as every other character HAS to be a female or black man. There's no room for character development, sensible plot or decent exchange, only cheap special effects without soul, and gender studies and feminist trash that is forced onto a public that does not subscribe or approve of the lesbian feminist agenda. Utter trash. Disney should be recycled into a giant manure pit and the Thrawn trilogy made canon. This completely tosses aside the fact that Skywalker was the chosen one, that the Death Star was pulverized etc...and where did Leia get her training all of a sudden? If she was so powerful, why didn't she train Ben Solo since she's so powerful with the force??These Hollywood lamos brought back Lando, Palpatine and everyone else just to sell tickets and fool you into believing that this feminist trash was actually about Skywalker. BOYCOTT hollywood and the SJW saga and hit them in the pockets and do not allow them to pollute our entertainment with leftist social justice feminist trash",0
983,The worst thing to happen to my eyeballs since that one time I cleaned my glasses with Windex,0
984,"The movie completely ignores all the Star Wars Lore, completely ruins what was achieved by the 6 Episodes that came before it and adds nothing new to the Star Wars universe.",0
985,"The more of a Star Wars fan you are, the less you will enjoy the Saga's conclusion. It feels like they didn't even try to make the story plausible or engaging. This movie puts the final nail in the coffin of what has turned out to be an absolutely pathetic trilogy, and makes The Phantom Menace ad Attack of the Clones  look like masterpieces. Rey's identity, the new character appearances and a hilariously bad plot twist halfway through make Episode 9 laughable.",0
987,"I didn't have high expectations going into this movie, but even those couldn't be met. This film is a total mess. It feels like two movies crammed into one and the overall plot has the quality of a mediocre fanfic. Once again the whole movie is full of distracting conveniences, characters that apparently have read the script and ""nostalgia baiting"". It would be one thing if it was bad on it's own, but they also had to lessen the original trilogy by bringing Palpatine back for this nonsense... To make it short: Nice visuals devoid of any 'real' substance.",0
988,"""This is the best episode of this trilogy"", said a review. Question is : is it enough to be good ? I think not.",0
989,far and away the worst Star Wars movie. They make the original trilogy and Vader's sacrifice meaningless by bringing the Emperor back. Anakin never needed to betray everyone and join the dark side because healing people and bringing them back to life is just a thing now. They establish that force ghost can now interact with the real world and use the force. So why not just have Luke materialize right next to the Emperor and kill him?,0
990,"Facepalming trash movie. Like I watched Kung Fury, but somehow it happened in Star Wars Universe.",0
991,I really wanted to love it but it is just a bad movie and an even worse Start Wars.,0
992,"Это удар ножом в спину всем фанатам Звездных Войн! Хотя нет, это не удар в спину это еще хуже, они (создатели фильма) забрались на нас сверху, взяли нож и медленно смотря нам в лицо загоняли его в самое сердце! Когда я смотрел фильм у меня на лбу появилась вмятина из-за фейспаунов, которые я каждый раз себе пробивал. Сюжет просто ужасный. Когда шел смотреть фильм, я уже знал что там будет из-за трелиров, а не из-за сполеров и как я хотел ошибаться, но все оказалось как я и думал.У меня не было сопереживания из-за победы ""доброй"" стороны, ведь я знал что в самом конце каким-то чудом они победят, найдут армаду кораблей, Рей получит силы джина и др. Это было смотреть просто скучно и больно из-за лба.	Сама картина если не брать просто идиотские моменты такие как из лука подбивают истребитель (прям как в Рэмбо с рогатки сбивать вертолеты), то картина выглядит неплохо. В добавок уже всем полюбившие мелодии это единственные плюсы.	Я ожидал что это будет потрясающая концовка. Такие были хорошие ожидания, но получилась сырая, очень скучная, недосказанная, местами просто глупая история. Мне очень жаль что я сходил и увидел этот фильм.",0
993,"Actually bad writing with an insanely rushed story and little to no character arcs. The trilogy had no overall outline, and this movie tries to compensate for that, but it just fails.",0
994,"Disney used the main story of star wars absolutely irresponsibly. How could you start a new trilogy without even a rough plan for the development of the plot and character arches? The narrative of the films looks completely unconnected. The number of plot holes and ""what ?!"" moments above all measurable levels. I want to forget it and pretend it never happened. Being a devoted fan of the prequel trilogy, I’m even a little glad that this happened, because compared to this disaster, the prequels will now begin to look even better.",0
995,This film ruins the entire arc of episodes 1-6 by bringing back Palpatine. An absolute disgrace and another appalling failure of this abysmal Disney trilogy.,0
996,The movie is rushed and breaks much of the established story essentially making episodes 1-6 useless in favour of making Rey the chosen one and heir to the Skywalker line. What an absolute mess attempting to appease both fans and critics and failing to do either.,0
997,It was a good “Star Wars” movie but all it did was bring more and more plot holes than ending them. Like how did Palpatine survive? How did Rey learn all these powers without being trained in them? Where was anakin?! I know we heard the voice but he was the chosen one! It is called the “rise of sky walker” for a reason! Not so the most predictable thing in all of movies could happen in Rey taking the name skywalker as her own! Anakin should’ve came to Rey at the end and help defeat Palpatine again but no they really went and did it again thanks Disney,0
998,Absolutely terrible. Any one who sees this and suggests you go is unquestionably a sadist who wants you to suffer. Dont go. Dont even pirate this disappointment. Save yourself the waste of two hours of your life you will never get back.,0
999,"This movie had a ton of great ideas and parts, but are poorly executed and make no sense due to how bad the last jedi was.

Poor end to a once great series",0
1000,"Если воспринимать этот фильм как дорогостоящий фанфик, то в принципе сносно. Если же считать это каноничным продолжением саги, коим его позиционирует Дисней, то это просто ужасное издевательство над оригинальной трилогией. Если Вам показалось, что в приквелах Лукас сделал что-то не так - умножьте это на десять, чтобы получить примерное представление о Девятом эпизоде. Как фанфик - 6/10Как каноничный эпизод саги Звёздных Войн - 2/10 максимум",0

I went in wanting a film where JJ Abrams and the producers (including de evil Kathleen Kennedy) stand in front of a camera and apologise for destroying my childhood memories of a film about space wizards and and a space rebellion. What I got instead was a fun piece of entertainer that had me thrilled in parts . I mean come on, who wants that after the epic fail o about broken characters trying to find a way to get the past behind them. Disney should be ashamed of what they did to something that i, and I alone own. Now if you don't mind I'm going to back into me echo chamber and cry while only listening to people who agree with my exact opinion of these movies and everything else. It's a sad day for star Wars fans, or at least people who think their fans but are in actual fact overgrown babes who are perfectly right about everything.This move is awful and if you see it you're part of the problem, whatever that actually is!!!!!!!!!!!",0

1005,All the Skywalkers are dead! What is the storyline now? Yes but Disney got their $200M. Absolutely pathetic story line and episode 9 was a disaster of a film. JJ couldn't even make a decent space battle. It was just a mess.,0

This includes ruining the legacy of the skywalker family. The only possible way to fix it would be to retcon the sequel trilogy which would never happen. All of the Skywalkers are completely ruined by these movies. Not to mention this movie is also just a horrible movie altogether. The visuals and action were very meh, especially for a movie that doesn’t even have a semblance of good writing to hold it up. The pacing is so ridiculously fast that if you went to the bathroom for 5 minutes they would have been to 3 different planets in that time. The writing is easily the worst in any Star Wars medium based alone on plot holes. JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson have ruined Star Wars and it seems like they’ve done it on purpose just to make it their own.

Hyperspeed skipping (I guess gravity wells aren't a problem any more)?  Sith wayfinders?  Horses riding on the top of spaceships?  Palpatine returning with zero explanation? Massive fleets and millions of Imperial personnel sitting in ice for 30+ years twiddling their thumbs?  Death Star weapons fit on star destroyers now? Force ghosts may as well be live people? Vader's sacrifice means nothing?  I'm starting to wonder if Kennedy, Abrams, and the Lucasfilm story group have ever seen any of the previous movies or read anything done under Lucas?

I feel any sane Star Wars fan will regard this movie as non-cannon trash so that the series can make a lick of sense.

The only nice thing that I saw was Rey show vulnerability for 1/4 of a second during her fight with Kylo, even though it make little sense and she just won at the end of the day anyways. The story writing has got to be the single worst element as it is just inconsistent garbage. This is particularly true when certain story or plot elements continue from the other movies. It also decided that it did not ruin previous characters enough and continues to squander the work of both the prequels and originals main characters.

Everything Lukedid in the original trilogy and everything theprequel trilogy tried to show no longer matter.This movie could have been good and it hadpotential, but any it had was quickly wasted, as within the first 30 minutes, it became apparent that this movie was going to spend a long time retconning what happened in Ep 8.Trying to please everyone with fan-service, itappears that JJ Abrams forgot that he wasdirecting a movie.",0

Why the hell the First Order had a massive fleet when they lost the Galactic Civil War in the OT?This is a mess. This trilogy will not hold up the time and is a lot worst than the Prequel Trilogy.

1057,Somehow manages to be insulting to fans who enjoyed the Last Jedi subversion of Star Wars tropes as well as those fans who held the old school legacy dear. Kind of a marvel in that sense. It's utterly nonsensical and mystifyingly contrived.,0
1058,"So I got dragged to see this movie by a friend of mine, as he had an extra ticket... At least I did not spend money on it myself... I went into this movie with the lowest of expectations and to be fair, I had already read a lot of the spoilers that where leaked. I will say this, it is a better movie than The Last Jedi, but that is not really saying much as that movie was hot garbage. But this movie has better visuals and there are some interesting moments. But that is about it. What a hot mess of a movie this was, basically damage control when it concerns TLJ and while I appreciate that they tried, it is painfully obvious that they should have just scrapped TLJ all together. This movie felt like they where cramming 2 full movies into one, checking boxes along the way. There is no substance in this and everything felt so incredibly forced it was just embarrassing to watch. I also do not understand why on earth they introduced so many new characters into an already bloated movie.While Kylo Rens arc is the best written one for this trilogy, it still falls flat because of that ending. As you stated, that kiss was just so out of place and awkward it made me literally facepalm. And Rey is just the biggest Mary Sue ever put on screen, she really never gets hurt in this entire trilogy, not a scratch on her. And her being a Palpatine is till not an excuse for her being so powerful. Anakin and Luke both where strong with the force but still needed a lot of training to use basic force powers. That Rey can just fly in the air, heal and all this crap is ridiculous.Finn is probably the most useless character in the movie, he is just there with no real purpose. Reeeey! that is basically what he does throughout the entire movie, just screaming names. And they introduced another black actor to play an ex-stormtrooper for some reason. I really don't get the point of her character, it was like she was just there to have Finn interact with someone.The entire setup with the enormous fleet was just so silly to me, and that all of them suddenly had planet destroying canons on them was just so idiotic. And it just became the same freaking story as Return of the Jedi. You even had the moment where the Emperor shows Rey that her friends are being killed, and he tells her to strike him down etc. Do the writers not have a single original thought in their heads? And to be honest, bringing Palpatine back is just the final slap in the face for the original trilogy. None of the accomplishments done by the original crew mattered at all.I have seen a lot of people praise the lightsaber duel between Rey and Kylo, and while it was not terrible I still felt like it missed something crucial to be a truly good and emotional fight. And my friend pointed it out after the movie that there was no music playing during the fight. And it makes so much sense now, as all the best fights in Star Wars have had amazing emotional music playing in the background. Duel against Darth Maul, the duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin and the last duel between Vader and Luke. All had truly amazing music that made those fights memorable.I don't have much good to say about this movie to be honest. But I did like one character in this movie way more than I ever thought I would, and that was C3PO. He was actually funny in this one.Anyways, this trilogy was doomed to fail from the start because they had no plan and The Last Jedi just ruined the story entirely. There was no chance of saving this train-wreck. It was an impossible task and I guess they should be commended for trying. I will ignore this trilogy as canon and anything that ties into this storyline. If they continue to make movies set in that era or even after it, I will not care and just skip it. If they want to save Star Wars, either go far back in time and do Old Republic stories. Or they have to just ignore their own creation and go far into the future and just have Luke and crew be legends. The ending to the saga was episode 6 and ignore the 7-9 as a what if scenario.",0
1061,"The pacing and many subplots aside, the main gripe many fans have with the movie is how it invalidated Episodes 1-6. Bringing back the original villain without any clear explanation as to how they survived makes it hard for most of the fans to suspend their disbelief. It could've been a great cop-out for a problematic trilogy if it wasn't executed so terribly. If you're a casual viewer, this film is watchable. You have the amazing effects, cool action sequences and musical score by the great John Williams. But if you're after a satisfying closure to 42 years of storytelling, this will only break your heart as it did mine. This should have been bigger than Endgame-- we're talking about four decades of storytelling right here. It's a rare shared cultural experience for all ages. And what did we get? A movie with no soul.",0

Rey is just so overpowered its facepalm ridiculous, it just doesn't work, the scrawny Rey is more of a superhero than a jedi, the character is just not believable.

1073,"Rise of Skywalker is an atrocity, absolutely horrendous piece of a movie, it does so many things poorly and unoriginal (hense Jar-Jar is a director again) that it hurts to watch. Plot makes absolutely no sense in the context of the movie, pacing is ripped appart and some of the ""twists"" just rammed in your face without explaining everything, like the Emperor is SUDDENLY Rey's grandfather, this scene where they ""reveal"" that, made literally everyone in the theater explode with laughter, its so stupid I geniunely question Jar-Jar's inteligence at this point. Aside from absolutely stupid plot and writing we also have poor character, some of the returning ones like Lando and Han, needless to say that new characters are just as useless as the older ones. While we're at bashing characters heres Rey, Jar-Jar just decided to go full autism and made her the most terrible Mary Sure character ever created, you can literally imagine any, and I mean ANY force power, and Rey now has it. Deal with it. She can quite literally bring people from the dead which raises SO MANY MORE QUESTION THAT THIS MOVIE WILL NEVER ANSWER that it was just anecdotic at this point and I completely gave up on this piece of garbage. If this movie wasn't bad enough it also completely bashes previous trilogies and destroys their legacy with rammed in-your-face death of Leia that makes zero sense. If you love Star Wars, if you love GOOD movies, completely ignore this movie by any means.",0
1074,"Where do I even start with this mess of a movie? It's like JJ Abrams had no idea what he was doing when he came back to finish this trilogy. You can tell he never though he would have to explain most of the things he left dangling in The Force Awakens. I'll try to break this film down as best I can:STORYThe film picks up about a year after The Last Jedi. The resistance has seemingly regrouped somehow, Kylo Ren leads the First Order and Palpatine is somehow back (No explanation is ever given for this). The entire film plays out like it was adapted from a screenplay written by a kid with ADHD. The first 1/3 of the movie zooms past at a breakneck pace that hardly allows the audience to digest anything that is happening. So many things happen in this film that you could argue it should have been two movies. The so-called emotional moments aren't even real. As soon as something happens to any of our beloved characters, it is immediately reversed. C-3PO loses his memory and gets it right back, Chewie dies! but turns out he didn't since he was on a different ship, Kylo Ren is impaled by Mary Sue, I mean Rey but is immediately healed by her. There are no stakes in this film. Nothing holds any emotional siginificance.  This film is a giant middle finger to Rian Johnson and ""The Last Jedi"" since 1/2 the movie spends its time retconning most of the decision made in the last film. It contains numerous plot holes that are far too expansive to list. By the time you get to the end you are wondering what the hell just happened. This movie is basically a poor carbon coby of Return of the Jedi. CHARACTERS- Rey is a Mary Sue Force GOD that shows a level of force ability we have never seen before with no explanation given as to how she has such incredible power. Being the emperor's granddaughter is such a cheap cop out and lame excuse to justify her raw force strength. She beats Kylo Ren (just like she has done in the last two movies) and destroys the emperor with little difficulty. Even Yoda had problems beating him and he was the Grand Master of the Jedi Order and the most powerful Jedi we had ever seen. - Finn is just there. They ran out of things for him to do after the first movie. The Casino plot line from the last movie proved that. The only thing he has ever been consistent at is running around screaminig out people's names for no reason. Oh and apparently he is force sensitive?- Poe seems to be thrust into a leadership role that is unprepared for after the death of Leia and he does his best. They make a mind boggling narrative decision to retcon his backstory and make him a former spice runner just like Han Solo (insert eyeroll). Of the trio of new heroes, he is probably the most likeable and that isn't saying much- Kylo Ren has been the best new character of this trilogy by far. He steals every scene he is in. It's a shame they killed him off in a sad attempt to recreate the Vader sacrifice from ROTJ. His redemption arc was the only good thing in this whole trilogy-Leia doesn't do much in this film which is to be expected with the passing of Carrie Fisher. Some of her scenes feel a bit awkward since it is cleared they were edited in from another film. All her scenes feature dialogue from other actors that clearly had to be reworked to include her. -Luke being in this movie is just fan service at it's finest. He exists soley to undone what was done to him in the last film.-Palpatine as the big bad who orhcestrated everything feels so cheap and rushed. He does nothing and then dies in the most ludicrous way possible. - Everyone Else: Lando is typical Lando, that's about as good as we could expect. Zori Bliss was a totally unneccessary addition as was Jannah. Neither served any true purpose in the story and their roles could have been filled by anyone. Bamboo Frick and D-O are simply a merchandising opportunities.PLOT HOLES- Rey can Force Heal ANYTHING. Despite this power having never been shown before she is somehow extrememly proficient at it. - Despite spending nearly her entire life on a desert planet, she somehow knows how to sail through waves that even an experienced sailors would have trouble navigating.- The Knights of Ren (who don't do anything in this movie) seem to be right on top of our heroes in multiple scenes but never make any attempt to capture them- The Force skype ability apparently allows characters to transfer solid objects (i.e. Lightsabers) seemingly making space travel irrelevant.- Palpatine is destroyed via his own Force Lightning due to Rey using dual lightsabers to block? Makes no sense- Palpatine created & cloned Snoke. From what? From Who?- Lightspeed Skipping. Completely disregards everything that was already established about interstellar travel. Ships shouldn't be able to jump to hyperspace if they are too close to a gravity well such as a planet. This was established in the OT. - Where the hell did Lando get that fleet?",0
1075,"Less a movie and more a protracted trailer reel spliced together with convenient plot points and melodramatic exposition. This is a movie with total disdain for the audience. The mystery box was empty all along. There is no story, only meandering plot filler, almost as if the writers were procrastinating having to come up with interesting story ideas so they kept delaying the true story elements by extending the convoluted plot until the very last nonsensical confrontation. Imagine the plot of Empire eating up the entire film to get Luke to Dagobah through a series of item quests instead of having Obi-wan merely show up and say ""You will go to the Dagobah system."" They use the Force in this movie in every contrived, fantastical way possible (it's more magical than mystical now) and yet they never use it as a device to simplify the plot. This movie is unfathomably stupid.",0
1076,"Soulless. Utterly soulless.  Star Wars defined a generation and this is how it ended?  People thought Season 8 of Game of Thrones was bad.  This movie has let down an entire generation.  While Ep7 and 8 had their issues, it was clear you were seeing the director's vision.  Whether you agreed with the vision or not the movies built on the Star Wars universe.  This movie felt like it was written by committee of people who did not know Star Wars, rushed out in record time.  It should have been scrapped, delayed and re-written when Carrie Fischer passed away.  Their attempts to keep her in the movie were forced and poorly done with terrible CGI effects.  The scene with young Leia was incredibly poorly done, worse than in Rogue One. When we think back to Colin Treverrow being fired from this for ""creative differences"" that's when you know this was a studio movie.  Designed to maximize merchandising opportunities and create a raft of under-utilized characters that added NOTHING to the movies but provide opportunities as characters in an expanded universe.I've seen MANY worse movies but never have I left the movie theater so disappointed.  The movie was ludicrous.",0
1077,"Might seems like a troll post but this is by far the worst Star Wars ever and haters of the last one are to blame. The Last Jedi wasn’t that great and had its flaws but my god is it better than this dumpster fire. From a story comparison, TLJ is a masterpiece compared to this, nothing to be worked in her and just goes to show you that the plan for this trilogy was completely half added and that ticks me off. I’ve loved this franchise since I was six right before the specials editions came out and been watching it since. I’ve never truly hated a Star Wars films but I have been bored with films like solo. I truly hate this film and has made me push this saga down the list. A lot of aspects in this film don’t lineup and ruin the other two films. Watching the other two films will be hard now because if leads to what? A prequel level rehash of the return of the Jedi? But, way dumber and goofy ass moments that feel like it’s from a B level sci-fi franchise rather than a billion dollar one. This film panders to the lowest common denominator. This transformer type of people that love that **** General audiences are to blame for this failure of a film. It just goes to show you the ineptitude of Disney and the brilliance of one. Disguising real filmmaking with a flashy, fan service, and nostalgia to trick people into thinking the film was good. This will 100% be the phantom menace of this trilogy and people will finally wake up to realize how much of a joke all this was. It all leads to disappointing nothingness while masquerading as a real love letter to the franchise. In the end, this film has turned me away from anything Star Wars and won’t be seeing anything of theres again. Unless they really change thing around. But, this is Disney. Tricking the public with big business operations to pony in money instead of making a good product. Money over substance. Obey.",0

JJ Abrams has seemingly gone to great lengths to undo the good faith earned by The Last Jedi and, to a lesser extent, his own The Force Awakens in delivering this overly cliche, predictable and risk-free vanilla ‘conclusion’ to the Skywalker Saga. This film is made even worse still when held in contrast with the final scene of The Last Jedi, where the vastness and the magic of the Star Wars universe presents itself to suggest that heroes can lie anywhere, yet in TROS we are seemingly told that nobody else matters but a select few. Hence, this elitist schlock does an immense disservice to every other Star Wars film which has come before it. Boo!",0

I think basically was trying to appease fandom too much and this is a film that that while strong in spectacle is ultimately devoid of any creative flare and originality .A certain high profile character from the prequel and original trilogies is brought back with little explanation . While not as contentious as the Last Jedi , lacking some of the childish aspects of the Phantom Menace and being slightly more original than The Force Awakens ( although it does repeat some aspects of Return of the Jedi ) it is still the worst of the episodic Star Wars movies . It devalues the events in Return of the Jedi and brings the Skywalker saga to an unsatisfying conclusion .",0
1087,"A lackluster ending to a 42-year journey.  JJ must have taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque.

A lot of fan service to the originals, unfortunately, the prequels are once again forgotten in the Skywalker saga's final episode. The Mary poppins style of character that is Rey once again is extremely apparent as well. Also it never explains how somehow Palpatine survived falling into a reactor and exploding Death Star and of course how he dies at the end seems too easy. The ending is good besides the fact that they used Rey instead of Ben Solo to defeat Palpatine and survive at the end. Which brings us to force healing. The ability is too powerful and really makes you wonder why the Jedi such as Obiwan, qui gon, Anakin, and such never used it. For the ending it didn't make sense for Rey to go back to the beginning where Anakin and Luke were from. Which is why it seemed it was meant to be Ben.",0

My scrotum hurt badly when Rey called herself a Skywalker in the end, as if my lovely sperm were fearful that I'd call them something different to my last name like Disney can as they can identify as whatever they like and bloodlines mean nothing to them.

The final 3 movies of the Star Wars series, leading to the Rise of Skywalker left me disappointed with each new release and Rise of Skywalker was no better.From the opening crawl to the very end it seemed... forced (pun not intended) crammed every minute of the movie with ever changing plots, and canon destruction had me sitting in the theatre at the end wondering ""What did I just see""The story line of this final film was spotty and leaves lots of questions, like how did Palpatine survive all this time, and if he was alive, why did he announce himself to the galaxy before his final plans were complete? Palpatine seemed so out of character in this film, his role made no sense, he truly was not as powerful as led to believe in the trailers and hints. The truly most powerful player in this role is Rey. How this person becomes a Jedi with little or no training then later on in this final being trained by none other than Leia who has the skills and experience of a Jedi Master is beyond even my experience in this final movie. Don't get me wrong, acting was great, special effects were good but as I stated earlier, much of Star Wars canon created by George Lucas was discard for Disney's version which left me wondering ""Why he ever sold this to them in the first place""Billie Dee Williams, Chewbacca, and the old guard had such short appearances it seemed like such a waste, Palpatine's time on screen was also so small and really was not needed that in all consideration you could say he was really put there to try to salvage this movie. I to this day am still trying to digest all that I seen in this movie, it made little on no sense on many of the scenes, and much you simply cannot recall or remember for almost all parts from the forced humor of the characters to the missions of Rey seemed to fill no purpose than to add wasted minutes to the screen time. The end of the movie was the most disappointing of all, and most confusing, it simply didn't seem like closure to the Star Wars franchise but a slap in the face, not one single person in the theatre applauded, most simply sat in their seats asking their neighbors for clarification of different scenes. If you go see this movie, as I did, keep an open mind. I did, and didn't let the negative points or reviews stop me, for being a fan of Star Wars I kept an open mind, believe me, the Last Jedi had me almost saying no way would I see this one but I wanted to give the final movie the benefit of the doubt. Sad to say, I should have stayed away, the last three movies of this franchise should have been done far better than what came out.  George Lucas, buy the franchise back and save us all.",0

1136,"Good job guys, you destroyed beloved characters while making a pricey ball of trash.  Very big fan of the franchise who will never go to another opening weekend.",0
1137,"This movie was a total train wreck. The plot was nothing but contrived nonsense. It kept breathlessly jumping from setting to the next adding in new characters or places, all of which are pointless and not memorable in any way. I thought The Last Jedi was the lowest Star Wars could possibly go, but, this managed to be worse in every way. And notice the ratio up down votes to up votes on the people who rated it a 10? I am guessing the 10s are paid shills. Nobody could possibly watch this movie think that it is a triumph of film making.",0
1138,"Finn is still useless why? John Boyega is a good actor and his character had a lot of potential to be so much more. Some People are having the audacity to call this film bold. As jeremyjahns said there is a difference between being bold and flat out desperation.Tension is lacking and the writing ranges from serviceable to glorified fan fiction. Rey is overpowered and the explanation why is a cop out. This feels like damage control the movie. Acting ranges from under acting, overacting, and Nicholas cage the Wicker Man level acting. The Chemistry is lacking it feels like “characters” are just going through the motions. Chewbacca, R2D2, C3PO, and Lando could be written out of the film and no one would bat an eye. Because they are just there as window dressing nothing more. The ending is very awkwardly done as well. Shout out to the makeup and costume designers and John Williams they did their job but outside of that save your money unless (you’re a parent, watching it drunk, or are Vince Russo from WCW) .Those who still think Jyn Erso > Rey in character development will not change their mind after this film. This film is a trap an utter cash grab it brings nothing legitimately new to the table outside of desperation, even worse lightsaber fights than tlj and tfa and divisiveness between fans.",0
1139,Throws away all previous lore. How does JJ respond to the criticisms that Ray is too OP too good with no build up? By making her the **** messiah lmao. There's no new enemies and lots of nostalgia. If you're into nice set pieces and cool light saber fights this will be a good movie for you. But trying to give it points for plot is like trying to separate the stink from a hunk of ****,0
1140,"I don't get why they needed to kill off the last Skywalker, when the title was The Rise of Skywalker. Should have just named it The Rise of Palpatine. Kylo Ren had the most interesting character arc, and now instead of showing more of redeemed Ben Solo, which was oh-so good! They were busy showing off the three silly stooges on a quest hunt at the beginning of the movie. Will not, and never understand the decision to kill off Ben Solo. I get that they want to end the Skywalker saga, but really there was no need to kill him off. They really could have just let him live and just carry on making other Star Wars movies that has no Skywalkers in them. But nope, just kill off the last Skywalker and give the name to a Palpatine instead. Which the last Palpatine - now Skywalker - will most likely never start up the Jedi again ever. So Sheev finally got his wish of the end of the Jedi. Now Rey started alone and ends up alone again. GREAT WRITING, GUYS! Disappointing, boring, yawn inducing, not original at all.",0

An ability to heal with the force and stop death that completely erased what was built in the prequels where Anakin succumbed to the dark side because Palpatine tricked him into thinking this power was possible. The story was terrible. They undid everything that had emotional impact. Let's kill Chewy. NOT. Let's wipe C3PO's memory...NOT. What if force spirits could ACTUALLY interact with physical objects which they clearly never could. What if we made a star wars movie that didn't give a rip about all of the original movies but then also put glimpses of the originals in it to further piss them off.

This would have to have been there before the Emperor was killed and before the new order. Why would the Emperor have a wayfinder to himself pre death? Darth Vader’s Sacrifice to save his son and kill the emperor was for nothing if the emperor just lived on.Luke knowing Rey was a Palpatine ruins the story of him not wanting to train her. Everything was destroyed in Rise of Skywalker. The lore, the sacrifices. Everything is made meaningless and totally pointless. As far as I’m concerned , The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and Rise of Skywalker do not exist. If they are allowed to be canon and exist, Star Wars is totally ruined and destroyed.J.J.

The plot itself just bounces around from planet to planet with Kylo Ren narrowly missing Rey over and over.

And I'm not talking about just the old trilogy or prequels, it even goes as far as to contradict/retcon previous 2 movies. It contributes nothing good to Star Wars universe, breaks a lot of laws of the said universe with no explanation, and I just really don't know where they could go next after this movie - Rey is so stupidly overpowered that there is nothing they could do to make it feel like there is anything at stake in future. The only option would be to scale down by either retconning Rey or just killing her off the screen and starting over with less powerful Jedi, so it actually feels like there is a risk of them losing.

For example, trained Sith Kylo Ren loses to a girl who holds a sword for the first time. And before that, he had an equal battle with the former stormtrooper.The ninth film takes all the idiocy to the limit.The WORST thing is that Disney began to continue the FINISHED SAGA, but it was necessary to do a NEW ONE!!!",0

I cannot even rate this film with a score of 1 or more because it is absolutely NOT an honest continuation of the original trilogy or prequels. It is corporate vandalism, and deserves a 0.

First, it sought to undo what it perceived as shortcomings in the previous movie (which, by the way, was a critical and box-office success), a situation that created a distracting and confounding sense of a movie trilogy at war with itself. Second, notwithstanding its misguided attempt to ""correct"" the prior installment, it is simply a bad movie, with huge plot holes (the emperor is alive? how?); unexplained superpowers; rushed, paper-thin story-telling, with very little intrigue and complexity; and stilted, by-the-numbers acting, that border on cringe in some instances.

These movies would be the result.Rey is just so powerful and... right and saves the day again and again.  No one is just so... great as her.  Its silly and the entire focus of the story becomes this one character who the writers, for whatever reason, want to dominate the entire... universe actually.  All JJ did was recycle a bunch of old ideas and characters and none of it makes sense.  There is no real feeling of dread because you know Rey will just solve all problems.  The entire plot destroys the original 6 movies and makes them all invalid.  Watching the original 6 movies again knowing how things turn out in 7 - 9 ruins the first 6 movies.  The writing is childish and there is no lead up or sense to it all.I saw the original movies dozens of times and invested my childhood and imagination for 40 years into the Star Wars universe.  Played the games, read the books, built the models.  There is nothing like the Star Wars universe, or at least, there wasn't.  It's dead now.  I will never watch EP 7 - 9 again.  The entire lore was pissed on and destroyed by these three horrid movies written by people who only wanted to make a quick buck.  Time will not be kind to these 3 movies.",0
1216,"Nothing in this movie works. Every event and character moment rings hollow and the overall plot is completely nonsensical. The film moves so fast that it comes off as a deliberate tactic to keep you from dwelling on how none of these events make sense, either in set up or execution. There are little to no character arcs to speak of; no one undergoes a change that requires more than a short conversation so ultimately the payoffs by the end are nil. The action scenes are meaningless, boring or both. This movie actively works against its predecessor to undermine any messages or consequences it had set up, leaving this movie, and unfortunately the overall trilogy, with absolutely no meaning or message.Watching Carrie Fisher's repurposed footage, with the knowledge that she has passed on, is quite uncomfortable and the integration of her footage was executed poorly. The fanservice in this movie is abundant and cringeworthy. No example feels earned or sensical, rather each instance feels like a hollow concession.If you watch a Star Wars movie to engross yourself in vivid alien worlds and cultures, or to undergo a fun, interesting and satisfying journey, then this movie is not for you. If you are an avid fan of the overarching narrative of the Star Wars series I would actively urge you to ignore this installment.The first few minutes alone destroyed any lingering investment I had in this universe, and left me bemusedly laughing or groaning at this ridiculous mess for the rest of the affair. I left the cinema feeling empty and detached.I legitimately cannot praise any aspect of this movie, but I would be remiss in failing to acknowledge the actors' performances. At no point did the acting feel weak to me, but at no point did it feel remarkable either. They did the best with what they had.Final verdict; do not waste your money on this.",0

1222,"The pacing was rushed. The dialogue was clunky and largely unmemorable when Star Wars is usually very quotable. The line ""Your parents sold you to protect you"" made me cringe. The characters were flat except for Ben Solo. Rey was regressed and felt weak. She seemed to lack any agency,  but that was the case with most of the characters.  The plot just happened to them. The only good part was the Ben Solo and the kiss. But Ben Solo has no lines, and his only purpose in the climax was to help Palpatine revive himself using the force bond then get knocked into a ravine.  The kiss and his smile were beautiful for 10 seconds,  but then he dies and just disappears.  The writers could have found a way for him to live but they stuck to the tired and depressing trope that redemption is found only in death. Rey is not shown to mourn him, he is never mentioned again, and is not shown as a force ghost alongside his mother and uncle at the end. There is no closure for his character. Rey ends up alone, her soulmate is dead. It feels like the message is that women need to be alone if they want to be heroes. Also, if you ever did anything truly wrong,  even if you redeem yourself,  you should die to that a better person should live. Just become an organ  donor and kill yourself. That is the moral this Disney movie left me with.Never has a film destroyed me emotionally in ways no other film ever did. They undermined the happy ending of the original trilogy to make way for the sequel trilogy,  and then ended it in tragedy. I don't think I will ever be able to watch or re-watch a Star Wars movie or show again. I will no longer be going to the Galaxy Edge park.

I beg my mind to vanish my memory about SW9... Baby ""yoda"" from The Mandalorian worth much more, then whole New Awful Trilogy... Shame you, Disney. Shame you, Abrams. Rian Johnson, forgive us, because your controversial SW8 wasn't even close to that boring trash without essence, that was named as ""The Rise of Skywalker""...",0

There are more half-assed scenes crammed in to these 2.2 hours than there are grains of sand on a beach.",0

1246,"There is not a single scene or even a single second of this movie which does not contain some kind of massive logical fallacy which even a child could spot.It is actually astounding that any human could read the script for this movie and allow it to be made. In addition to the nonsensical plot the movie is incredibly badly paced. Characters and locations skip by with no sense or reason. One minute you're on a desert planet, then an ice world, then a jungle and it's really impossible to tell why. The characters chase pointless macguffins in order to complete quests and perform actions which make no logical sense at all. The action scenes are also tirelessly dull. The direction is bland and boring, the choreography is non existent. The space battles are a mess of explosion effects with no cohesion. There's not even a decent lightsaber fight. It's just so dull. So dull and messy and boring. Every line of dialogue is either retconning events from a previous movie or absolute direct-to-the-audience exposition. All facts are delivered at least 3 times, just in case you missed it. But it doesn't matter if you did because it's all ultimately pointless. All of the characters are awful. Directionless one-liner spouting pointless plot devices. There are no arcs, there is no development. There is barely even a struggle. Rey is an omnipotent plot device, whose force abilities come and go on a whim depending on the needs of the script. This is not only easily the worst star wars movie to date, but probably one of the most poorly constructed and badly written movies to ever hit the cinema. I'm not joking. I wanted to walk out. Anyone who posts an even half way decent review of this movie is either a shill for Disney or an utter moron. It makes the Phantom Menace look like a masterpiece.",0
1247,To be honest i expected nothing from this film and was still let down. Thats a hands down worst Star Wars film ever created. This film has complete lack of story telling and is just terribly executed. I hope Disney will never make any new Star Wars movies ever again. Completly ruined franchaise.,0
1248,This movies looks and sounds great.But that's It what you can expect from a 250mio budget movie.The Story is absolut nonsense.Just a chaotic and plott with endless flaws.Sorry this feels more like a fan fantasy from a 14 years old,0
1249,"Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker is a deeply disappointing dumpster fire of a movie. I’ll admit that I didn’t like the previous films in this trilogy, but this “finale” is a soulless mishmash of terrible “remember this? let’s F that up!” and ""go fetch this thing, now go fetch that thing"" writing with an ending that totally stomps all over the heroic journey of Luke & Leia. This is all done in favor of a BORING blatant Mary Sue character (Rey) and her shoddily written pals. It’s entirely awful, and the ending is insulting to fans and worse than bad fanfic. Avoid it. JJ Abrams should never be allowed to work on anything ever again; though honestly we all knew that when Lost ended in a pile of stupid.",0
1250,It continues what The Last Jedi started in killing off the integrity of the original trilogy. It makes sure that the audience is aware that everything we believed about Star Wars was wrong. The Skywalkers are failures in this trilogy.,0

1254,"That's the worst star wars movie ever. Trivial and predictable plot, choices inconsistent with the universe we knew.  A ridiculous use of the characters introduced in the previous chapters. Rey is OP for no reason, Finn and Poe are useless. It's an incorrigible shame for Lucas and an absolute failure fsr Abrams",0

1256,"Save your money. Maybe catch it on Disney+ when it comes out early next year.Want explosions and cool fights? This movie isn't terrible for that, but there are better ones. You would have a better time watching Starkiller base blow up, or a ship ram through a dozen First Order's than watching this. It doesn't have emotional scenes that make you believe them. No part like when Luke or Han died where you feel something. It's just dragging yourself through it, waiting for something to look cool and when you thinkk it is it lets you down.If you came for the writing or the story? Wrong place, too. It's nonsense most of the time, like they were rushing it. Corners cut, a budget with hundreds of millions and yet they couldn't scratch up two writers to make this worth it. I can watch an old movie without the booms or the bangs if it has good writing, but the quality of this movie both visually and story wise is a massive let down. Hard pass.TL;DR? Save your money and catch it on Disney+, no one's gonna be talking about this one.",0
1257,"And J.J. Abrams strikes again... he truly is the ""destroyer of franchises"". First he killed Star Trek and now Star Wars. It is sad to see, how this 40 year-old saga has come to an end, it would have deserved a much better ending with more respect to what has been established before.",0
1258,"Saw this online, the best parts in it were the ad breaks for gambling sites.",0
1259,The movie is incredible self-serving. They create an unrealistic and unfounded issues only to solve it with the most unconventional and irrational way. The plot makes no sense and the movie constantly defies the rules of the “Star Wars” universe.,0
1260,"Potential purposefully thrown away. To say that upfront I HAVE a lot of positive things to say about previous Disney EPISODIC entries.This should had been the movie that would engrave the sequel trilogy as well-made one, the one that respected all that came before and stood on its own, but it doesn't do any of that. Instead, it became THE WORST Star Wars movie that spits on its predecesors for story convenience, which is for the most part an unsensical fan catering, zero intelligence garbage with no sense of pacing, rhythm or even emotion really. Half-way through, after a certain reveal it brings this anxious dread evoking the worst possible story progression one could ever think of and it happens to be stronger and stronger while the movie rushes to the finish line. Leaving you with no emotion, only apathy.When internet fandom split into two separate camps (one more vocal than the other), after TLJ premier, something miraculous had happened. Disney or JJ with Terrio somehow thought it would be a marvelous idea to retcon any story progression from the previous movie, ignore fans who defended TLJ for two long years and try to appease fans who hated it. Ultimately, no one likes this movie, because it is far from being one. Desperate and safe attempt for damage control effectively erasing this sequel trilogy from canon.",0
1261,Most trilogy’s have a phase for each movie being created like phase 1 then phase 2 then phase 3. This trilogy is phase 1 phase 1 phase 3 completely skipping phase 2 and having 2 beginnings. Also this movie doesn’t understand what Star Wars is and just tried to be like OG trilogy. Completely disappointed.,0
1262,the disrespect to the original trilogy is off the charts. Luke Skywalker should have been the main character. instead they try to erase him and Darth Vader completely and pass all their accomplishments to Rey. i'm not going for it! not canon!!,0
1265,"This is a thoroughly unentertaining, borderline unwatchable movie built to service original trilogy and prequel fans through constant nods to Star Wars history and blatant reversals from the previous movie. All three films in the sequel trilogy have indicated no overarching plan. At their best, they challenged long-held beliefs and attempted to move the saga out of its comfort zone. At their worst - which Rise of Skywalker represents - they capitulate to the lowest common denominator and hope a plotless, lightsaber-fueled, ""take down the hundreds of Death Star-level Star Destroyers"" is appeasement enough for the audience.",0

Not only that, but all the retcons and overuse of the force made everything feel pointless and exhausting to watch. Not to mention the shallow relationships between the characters, bloated effects, and moronic plot contrivances. All in all, the movie was a slog to sit through, and felt utterly pandering. I could go on and on in depth about this movie and the things I didn't like about it, but I simply can't be bothered to care enough to do so.",0
1275,"The new trilogy doesn't exist for me... Dreadful and adding nothing to the original and even the prequels... This movie tried to tell a lot but nothing interesting at all, shoving new things into a world which has already better alternatives. And ofcourse another devilish over the top plot-line which makes no sense... Nothing makes any sense, characters don't develop, not funny, no star wars feelings... If you don't know anything about Star Wars I don't understand how you can find this enjoyable, if you like Star Wars this way of storytelling should drive you mad... Anyways, I'm glad we still have hope thanks to the Mandalorian and future series... But let the Skywalkers die now please...",0
1276,The Rise of Skywalker clearly tried to be its own movie after TLJ but it failed to be a coherent movie. It's just filled with plot holes and even more stuff to destroy the original trilogy. The ONLY thing I did like about this movie was the jabs it took at The Last Jedi. So sad. What a mess they made of Star Wars and how much they hurt its legacy. At least now its over. Time to move on and forget about this mess of a movie.,0
1277,"Truly a cannon breaking film with no continuity, going at break neck speed in an effort to stop you asking why it makes no sense and feels like a cheap video game narrative. No character development or arc no originality or fresh ideas. Just nonsense and makes the og trilogy and anakins story pointless.  Turned into a super heroes in space film with no consequence to anything, no impact, no meaning, hacky writing and terrible editing, I wonder how much Disney wrecked this film. Why not though they wrecked the biggest franchise on the planet. Finn could have been interesting same with  other new characters but with no arc they were just padding. I guess the only surviving force user is a palpatine who identifies as a Skywalker",0

1291,"The final chapter of the Skywalker saga is simply rushed and unoriginal. The movie does not give you any time to process what’s happening scene to scene and there is a severe lack of character development within the movie as well. None of the characters are used properly and Rey’s origin story feels like a cop out and to be honest, you could probably watch this movie without TLJ entirely because there is barely any continuity. It’s a shame we have to end the saga this way and I think JJ played it way too safe and that was his downfall. From start to finish TROS is a complete mess and I wish I would have gone to see Cats instead, because then I wouldn’t have to deal with the surge of negative emotions that overcame me from the moment the credits started to roll. A horny cat story sounds much better than that.",0
1292,"Rey is by far the worst written character in star wars. The things she is able to do are ridiculous, and make zero sense",0
1294,"This movie only tries to save the mess that Ruin Johnson did on episode 8 but it was just not possible to fix it. This trilogy is a joke !! Why not following the **** extended universe Disney ? Why making a stupid copycat of episode 4 ? Why don't having a REAL, FULL story before making this new trilogy ? This is embarrassing, don't spend money on this garbage ...",0
1295,An awful experience that make a longtime fan wondering why he's still loving this franchise handled by gritty and careless people.,0
1296,"This movie is TERRIBLE. There is literally no reason this movie or trilogy exists, but we know why it does: To make money and to please dumb fans who get impressed by the most trivial things. Woah! Palpatine is back! It was very cool that he survived somehow only to be defeated very easily. Definitely cool to watch after the perfect ending that was Return of the Jedi! Like I said, there is NO REASON this movie exists. It is just an much inferior version of the original trilogy's ending. These Disney films can't stand on their own two feet without the original trilogy. I have no attachment to any of the new characters, their character arcs were horrible, this story is horrible. The most insulting thing is that Anakin didn't play a major role. J.J. Abrams said he brought back Palpatine because it wouldn't make sense to not have him in a 9 chapter story, but in that case why didn't you include the MAIN HERO of the prequels who is also the MAIN VILLAIN of the original trilogy? It would have been a powerful moment to have Anakin, who Kylo idolizes, redeem his grandson. Instead we get Han who... appears? Somehow? As a force ghost... I guess? I don't even know. It makes no sense and Anakin would have made much more sense. There's also no reason Kylo Ren should give a **** about Han Solo other than him being his father, it seemed like they have barely any attachment to eachother at all.  This movie and this trilogy disrespected Star Wars, and I am disgusted. The main reason this film is bad is due to The Last Jedi not leaving any room for anything else to happen, that movie took steps back so they were forced to dig deep and bring back Palpatine. There is so much **** that is confusing... Palpatine made Snoke? He had clones of Snoke? Why didn't he use multiple Snokes? Does Snoke have a mind of his own? It's not even worth understanding so I won't even try. This trilogy is such a joke, there was no direction and clashing directors. It was a mistake to have JJ direct the last film, it's also a mistake to give the director ALL creative control. This plot in this movie is on par with a sixth graders' terrible, terrible fan fiction. Palpatine should have been easily able to defeat Rey, did they forget he is one of the best lightsaber wielders? Why didn't he push Rey down the pit where he pushed Kylo? Why is Palpatine a one-trick-pony who can only use lightning and didn't even stop using it against Rey when CLEARLY he was dying. So **** stupid. The reason he kept doing it against Mace Windu in the prequels is because he wanted Anakin to help him, but even then he didn't have a lightsaber. Also, why the hell does Palpatine DISINTEGRATE from force lightning just because Rey has two lightsabers? Why does Rey go to a planet the Skywalkers hated and bury Luke and Anakin's lightsabers with a droid that isn't even hers? Why does she call herself Rey Skywalker? Imagine if instead it was: ""Your name's Rey? Where are you from? Oh, you're alone and don't have a people? We'll call you... Rey Solo"" (just making fun at Solo). This is the least satisfying conclusion to a nine part film saga. Return of the Jedi's ending was perfect, the new trilogy has NO VISION. A small nitpick but this film also has the worst soundtrack out of any Star Wars movie, with very little variety as they use the same like 5 themes. If force ghosts can interact with the world, why don't they fight Palpatine? They can cast lightning and lift X-Wings, they're already dead so why the **** don't they fight Palpatine lmao. I was 100% rooting for Palpatine, and I can't imagine why you wouldn't. He is a much better character than the new protagonists, yet Palpatine is a joke in this movie and his plan makes 0 sense. He was for sure an asspull, it's insulting that he survives after Episode 6. The whole point of the first six movies was Darth Vader's redemption. This movie is just a ****ty version of that, with Kylo Ren's redemption after a very forced kiss with Rey. He just disappears lmao. It was a terrible decision to have the SEVENTH MOVIE in a 9 part story be a remake of part 4, while the ninth movie is a remake of the sixth part. We already saw all this **** in Episode 6 but it was actually meaningful, now we have Rey representing all the Jedi that have ever existed... why the hell. That was the whole point of Luke, and he was supposed to rebuild/revive the Jedi, and represent the Last Jedi. Even though they made a movie called ""The Last Jedi""-- you realize he was the Last Jedi in Episode 6??? They were so afraid of the prequel backlash they just remade the same **** story. Episode 8 was so afraid of backlash (albeit it was a small amount) they tried desperately to subvert expectations. After Episode 8 backlash they played it safe like TFA again, and it leads to the least satisfying ending of all time. It would have been neat to have the Jedi back, even if it was just a small number like 15 Jedi. Running out of characters. TLDR; this movie is awful.",0
1299,"As a stand alone movie it's not bad. But as a SW main movie. Well, it's the last nail this coffin needed.Hope the fan who are praising this movie are also happy that the EU died for this to happen.",0

It is disgusting to see them, I won”t make such mistake again and pay for that. People who put positive marks have really bad taste (or brains)",0
1310,This movie is the worst of the trilogy and the worst of the entire saga.It's now 100% clear that Disney had no roadmap and no idea what they wanted to do with this trilogy.

1312,"Aaaaah...this really is the poorest Star Wars film of the lot. Three films that feel totally disconnected and lacking a sense of direction and purpose.The latest one sees numerous light sabre battles that are simply meaningless and monotonous. I just cant help but feel that the writers have done a really poor job of building up a climax over the course of 3 fulms. Compared to this, the prequel trilogy is a work of art.",0

1318,"Let's keep this simple...JJ attempted to patch all the plot holes left by Rian Johnson by rushing a carbon copy of Return of the Jedi with enhanced effects and failed.KK attempted to appease blue checkmarks wth forced diversity, 3rd wave feminism, and garbage politics... She has failed to learn that they can never be satisfied and will hopefully lose her job soon.This movie attempts to lure in loyal star wars fans with abundant fan service so the little mouse can count his enormous amount of revenue. (Huh huh) *mickey mouse laugh*The cinematography and soundtrack are the highlights and are my justification for 2/10. It should really be 1/10 because the soundtrack has been the same since A New Hope, but I also give JJ credit for even having the guts to attempt following up Rian Johnson's abortion.Rey is a God and shall not be defeated, she is the best, nothing comes close, she knows everything, wins everything, knows all the tricks and abilities without training, she is a real HERo and in no way a Mary Sue, and you're a misogynist if you disagree with this sentiment.- Unoriginal plot- Undoes the original trilogy- Terrible acting across the board- Rushed production- Pacing is all over the place- Awful characters- Abused fan service- Pandering and politics- Incompetent writing across the trilogy- Murdered a once great franchise- Literally no explanation for anything that transpired in this film... oooo mystery box JJ at it again.Overall, The Force is Female, Rey is Space Jesus, and I give this 2 porgs on a stick out of 10.P.S. Fire KKSincerely,The entire Star Wars fan base.",0

1326,"(Sorry AJ and other friends who I know love Star Wars!) I wouldn't know a Star Wars from a Star Trek though I believe I saw the first Star Wars movie and one later on. I had to approach this movie as a stand alone film and I must admit I was confused from the first frame to the last not knowing who was who and then all of a sudden there is Mark Hamil here for a few seconds, Harrison Ford with even less screen time but I did recognize Carrie Fisher who played the princess with the hair buns who faded in and out.It may mean something I remember the robots from the first film and I saw the hairy Chewbacca who I remember from somewhere but the relationships between the various characters are a complete mystery to me.There are certainly a lot plane fights not to forget all the light saber fights. There is one action scene after another as if the film stopped to hold its breath for a minute the audience would moan.The movie is 141 minutes, seems to move fast with all the action but seemed to have taken 4 days to watch!It was good seeing Adam Driver as I had been very impressed with him in both ""The Report"" a Prime Video movie and ""The Marriage Story"", which should definitely get him an Oscar nomination, but I have no idea who he is in this movie.Maybe if I had seen the 9 films, 5 series, 4 Animated mini-series, 3 live action series and the 3 Star Wars TV films I might have liked this better but even Allen, who is a Star Wars fan and the reason we went to see this, wasn't impressed.I really can't recommend this movie but I will let the Star Wars fans make up their own mind about seeing it and, yes, millions are seeing it.",0
1327,"Just a really poor movie. JJ Abrams caved to the whiny rightwing snowflakes, and made a another fantastically unoriginal, cookie-cutter orgy of fan-service fluff. There really is no point in wasting your time or money on seeing the movie, since you already know exactly how the story is going to go if you've ever seen any other Star Wars movie before. Just an incredibly disappointing way to cap off what started off as a promising trilogy through the first 2 installments.",0
1328,"Second viewing today, my score is changing from 7 to 3. I initially wanted to give JJ Abrams credit for having to deal with what Rian Jonson did.... but JJ did NOT have to introduce so many extra pointless characters, he did NOT have to introduce a deus ex machina. That was completely unnecessary. So much in this film is unnecessary, some is completely pointless. it only adds extra material to a film that was already way too packed and with major pacing problems. What we have been given is a bloated mess with scenes that fly past so quickly that we are reeling, trying to catch up, trying to remember who that person was, where they are going, what their objective is...",0

Meta critic is toxic and known for people being babies and deflating scores with 0s.Realistically the movie is a 6 or 7. It’s watchable and I found it entertaining. Personally thought Abrams’ did a good job cleaning up the mess that was The Last Jedi and I give him props for that. They should of just let him direct all 3 of these movies and I promise this trilogy would of actually had an impact.,1
1350,"I've been a Star Wars fan for already over thirty years, and I enjoyed this movie. I went in a bit scared because I did not care for The Last Jedi at all (it basically did nothing to advance a story, just killed Luke), but I'm so happy to see that J.J. was able to put something good together here.He ignored a few things from Last Jedi, took jabs at others, and continued the story as he envisioned it starting in The Force Awakens.I think this is a fine ending to the Skywalker Saga.It is by no means a perfect movie, and there were some things I did not like, but honestly, the positive very much outweighs the negative. Rey was more of a likable character, Kylo Ren was absolutely epic, Finn and Poe were back to their amazing chemistry and banter... I did not mind Palpatine being back at all, either. Altogether a great movie, and worthy ending.Much better than The Last Jedi, and that in itself is a big relief!",1
1351,"Even though J.J. Abrams prefers to paint by numbers, his works remain fulfilling.",1
1352,"An almost impossible movie to review as it seeks to pull together the completely disjoint trilogy with the previous 6 movies. It's a fun enough adventure romp - ala Indiana Jones without the charismatic lead. You simply have to go with the underlying premise that much of the previous 2 movies are just bait-and-switch nonsense, with the Emperor's return not being overly menacing or meaningful... but they had to have someone. Much of the movie is just action-for-action-sake, and you don't really get much conclusion that sticks the landing. The Reylo story line would have been better if it had had the whole movie to coalesce, but instead as they are trying to fit 2 movies into 2h20m they skip over a lot of the interesting plot developments. And there could have been some great story-beats to the movie - if Palpatine had been introduced earlier, and not left as a 'in-case-of-emergency' device. Also, while Driver and Ridley do a great job with what they've got, there's little substance to their twists and turns. Space horses has a Canto Bight feel to it as well, and I was half expecting to see Darth Maul make an appearance. There's a good movie here, but it's handicapped by a 3 movie mess.",1

Восход)Джей-Джей Абрамс ловко сложил из всех фанатских теорий цельный эпизод, разве что сам не сыграл Джа Джа Бинкса, который является самым главным злодеем саги по конспирологии вселенной SW, оставив огромный пласт для развития историй между восьмёркой и девяткой на откуп ""Disney+"". При этом складывается впечатление, что источником для идейности ленты стал трек группы КАСТА ""На порядок выше"", где стратегии в повествовании фильм придерживается чётко, стараясь всячески быть самостоятельным, обходя все восемь картин до, в попытках работать на максимальную аудиторию и не забывать при этом свои корни. На вопрос который заботит больше всего невероятно уставших от мира Звёздных Войн ""Ставится ли точка в конце?"", предельного ответа так и не получит ни кто, ведь в последних пяти минутах всё наследие Лукаса, хоть и зарывается под землю, но утвердительный возглас главной героини, что пронзает пространство, аккуратно включая свой световой меч, так же бережно вырисовывает восклицательный знак.",1
1354,"Honestly this is the best movie of the trilogy (which is not saying much I know). But after the disaster that The Last Jedi left, I think JJ Abrahams managed to salvage a lot.There are plotholes and several scenes felt rushed. But here is the thing: it feels like a Star Wars film. Maybe with 20 extra minutes, the movie would be better since there were a lot to retcon",1
1355,This movie feels like they put combined everything that was set for 8 and 9 together and they just didn't have enough time. While the story and what they were trying to do was good the pace felt too quick with the beginning being very crunched for time.  All in all it was a pretty great movie.,1
1356,"Loved it!I didn't like the last Jedi and thought the force awakens was okay. This movie definitely struggles to fit so much into it but I loved it.The action is fantastic, the music is wonderful and the movie itself looks incredible.",1
1357,"This movie actually kinda surprised me. Did not love the last movie, so that may be why I found this one to be quite enjoyable. It is by no means a perfect movie, there are a lot of story inconsistencies throughout the film, and just this trilogy in general. But, once I stopped to think about it, I did end up liking this movie over all.",1
1358,"To the people who was born with the first 3 movies. You do not own it.This film manage to make up for some of the things that the last movie failed at or left behind. It gives satisfying answers, epic fight scenes and space battels. It gives a feel of reedem and an awesome movie, while the power level can at times seem a bit over the top, its not so much that it ruin the film. If you watch it with an open mind, you are in for a dosen good suprises.",1
1359,You can easily tell that they were trying to repair bad storytelling in the last two movies with more bad storytelling. It feels cobbled together and the pacing is incredibly rushed.,1
1360,"Yes, it had to fix some of TLJ's bizarre plot twists, but this is the best of the Disney Star Wars movies after Rogue One. I can't wait to watch it again and cannot be friends with anyone who prefers TLJ over this.This is a great Star Wars movie, made for the fans by a fan.",1
1361,Not great but I did not hate it. It feels like the story from a video game. The writers seem to have made a list of all the fan complaints from Reddit and attempted to make amends one-by-one. It is like a whole trilogy in one movie. I think if they had been working toward this ending for all three movies it would have had a lot more impact.,1
1362,A fitting conclusion to the saga.  Disregard critics so out of touch with everyday movie goers,1
1363,"I think people need to calm down about this movie being “the worst of the saga”, acting like the train wreck known as the prequels don’t exist. In my opinion, this is just Return of the Jedi done right. I don’t blame the extremely fast pacing the first hour. J.J. Abrams had to fix the problems that Rian Johnson left with The Last Jedi. Obviously he didn’t want this movie to be a 4 hour snore fest so I’m fine with him setting up the plot very quickly, even if it is a lot to take in. Rey and Kylo’s bond remains compelling, as they try to set their differences apart to team up. People say the Emperor’s return is stupid but if Darth Maul can get sliced in half, fall into an endless pit and still survive then I’m fine with the Emperor living. A problem I had with TLJ was the completely unnecessary side plot that wasted Finn’s character. I’m glad that every part of the plot in this movie felt like it actually mattered and wasn’t just there for filler purposes. Another problem I had with TLJ was Snoke’s death. We never learned anything about the character, despite being built up in TFA as the second coming of the emperor. I am a little more satisfied knowing that Snoke was nothing more than a pawn of the Emperor because it means we don’t need character development for him. While this movie’s plot feels recycled from ROTJ, I am perfectly okay with it. They took out all of the unnecessary parts from that movie and put the good parts into this movie. There is a lot of plot convenience such as the new droid knowing the Emperors location, Rey being able to heal people with the force (although at this point, I’m convinced that the force can solve every problem) and the ships coming at the exact time when Poe loses all hope. However I can’t deny that this story had me captivated, the action kept me on the edge of my seat and it was the best possible way Abrams could’ve ended this trilogy and saga. Each character arc felt complete except for Finn, who never told Rey that he’s force sensitive. Then again, everyone was completely fine with Leia being force sensitive and not doing anything with it in ROTJ so I’m going to let this slide. I will say that this movie is incomparable to A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back but it still stands on its own as a good movie and a good conclusion to the end of this trilogy and the saga.",1
1364,"It wasn’t terrible. There were a lot of big moments, first two acts felt like they were dragging(gotta get that plot out of the way before the “pew-pew-pew,” you know?), a few big reveals... Leia got a hell of a lot more screen time than I had expected... I can’t wait to see James Dean in the next Fast and Furious movie. You could tell it was a JJ Abrams movie, though. I counted four “we’re in this together!” and “if we can’t live together, we’re gonna die alone!” speeches and I kept expecting Palpatine to turn into the Smoke Monster from Lost. That would have been something.",1
1365,"I am looking at this movie as if the last one didn't exist, because you can technically discount 90% of The Last Jedi, only watch about 20 minutes of it, and it would tie in just fine with this one. I think JJ delivered the best he could and it was actually really enjoyable. I loved how he dissed Rian about 20 times, and he answered all the questions without any inclusion of current political landscape. I do wish there was more back story on the Emperor, i.e how he survived, but in the other than that, I thought it was good. Rey's back story explained. Ben Solo finally comes home. The old characters get some tribute paid to them. Them finally got the respect they deserved. I loved how Lea was trained as a Jedi. Great job saving the franchise JJ.",1
1366,"It was always going to be a tough task to finish off the sequel trilogy and the overall Star Wars saga but I think JJ Abrams did a very good job. The film looks fantastic, with some amazing scenes and great performances, especially from Driver and Ridley. I liked how the film drops us straight into the reveal of Palpatine's return and Ren initially wanting to destroy him. The film feels fast paced, action packed and covers a lot of ground. Sure it's not perfect, but it's the best film we were going to get after the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney and is better than the ideas George Lucas had for the sequels, though some of the better ideas actually did make it into these sequels, with some modifications that actually improve them while omitting terrible ideas like the midichlorians and the Whills and the microbiotic world Lucas wanted to explore further. Full respect to George Lucas for creating Star Wars and the original trilogy but the prequels were a massive disappointment. The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker on the other hand are very enjoyable and capture the feeling of the original and The Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi is the worst of the three, but the last third of that film is decent. The Rise of Skywalker attempts and mostly succeeds in bridging the ideas of the sequels with the established story from the original trilogy and even the prequels, bringing back the Emperor, who is also a pivotal part of the entire storyline. My only complaint is there was no real explanation as to how he returned, but the line 'The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural' covers it enough. The Rise of Skywalker is an entertaining film that answers most of the questions raised in previous instalments. Some will like the answers, others may not.",1
1367,"I'm glad there are numerous middle finger salutes to the self-indulgent bilge that was Rian Johnson's nonsensical and dreadful screenplay. There were numerous directions the characters could have taken in that movie while still respecting them and their history in the Star Wars universe. At it's heart, that was its main problem because anybody that disliked the movie simply didn't buy-in to the decisions or choices that those characters made as they were utterly ridiculous. Not to mention its infantile and inappropriate humour. Its only saving graces were the cinematography and the interactions between Ren and Rey. The rest is all codswallop.IX has its problems, sure, the story beats are familiar and the ending could have done with some work, but mainly its final act is tightly crammed and hasn't got much room to breathe. What wouldn't when its left to tie and clean up the utter mess its predecessor left, but its also satisfying and very entertaining at the same time. The performances from the main cast are excellent, the score is wonderful and the callbacks are handled beautifully, it's visually spectacular and probably one of the very best looking Star Wars movies so far and it has some good humour in the right places and with proper context. The same Ren and Rey interactions are great again, and the scenes that feature Rey, Finn, Poe and Chewie when they are working together the movie is a treat. I went into this thinking the worst after the reviews of the past few days and was pleasantly surprised and it deserves a hell of a lot more credit than what is currently being thrown at it by critics.",1
1368,"I am baffled by half of the critical/audience reaction because this is exactly the ending, I predicted.This epic franchise deserves a better score and I hope it receives Oscar nominations. I do not understand the hate given that the plot elements perfectly correlate what was indicated in the previous two films as well as the cast making it clear where it was ending in various interviews. Read between the lines.I wasn't surprised by anything in the film and the themes of redemption are powerful. Long live BB8. We do get to see more character screen time for the trio.",1
1369,"Everything it needed to be and more! Great fun, many touch points to previous films and expanded universe. Feels the most integrated into the greater pantheon of heros. A resounding triumphant return to form. I enjoyed this film very much",1
1370,"My favorite fantastic saga is Star Wars. And I think, that it is great final",1
1371,"Could have been alot better, but it's a fitting conclusion nonetheless to the much talked-about and highly anticipated Star Wars sequel trilogy.Final grade: 7.6/10",1
1372,"If you loved Last Jedi, you probably won't like this movie.  If however you left last Jedi thinking WTF did I just watch (as I did), well this movie tries to rectify that.Rise Of Skywalker isn't perfect.  It has several silly/cheesy moments, and some other parts you have to just kind of accept even though they don't make a ton of sense.  A lot of people have complained that the pacing is really rushed, and that it true.   But in the end, it is an enjoyable film with some beautiful visuals, and a few emotional moments that actually hit home quite a bit harder than I expected they would.  Anyone saying this is the worst Star Wars film ever has a personal axe to grind.  It's definitely not the worst or the best.  It's an enjoyable, flawed, film that is worth seeing to make up your own mind.",1
1373,"The cast is terrific. Unlike The Last Jedi, there is not a weak performance in this movie. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver have done some of the best acting in the whole saga for this trilogy. Also unlike The Last Jedi, the new characters added in this film, General Pryde, Zori Bliss, and Jannah, are actually good. Ian McDiarmid gives a performance very much like in the second half of Revenge of the Sith, and I loved it. The film moves very fast and it is easy to miss important pieces of dialogue on your first viewing. C3PO gets a more significant role than he's had since 1977, which was wonderful. There will probably be people that don't realize that Carrie Fisher died before the making of this film. She was well handled, especially given the situation.The plot of this film is an attempt to make a sequel to The Last Jedi, which did certain things you shouldn't do in you middle act of a trilogy. JJ decided to bring back Palpatine, which on paper frankly sounds ridiculous and fan-servicey but he managed to make it work.I would call this movie a beautiful mess. It is flawed, but given the setup of The Last Jedi and the fact JJ had 3 fewer months to make it vs The Force Awakens, I think he probably did the best he could, and I really like it.There is a lot of hate for the new trilogy, not unlike the prequels. There's an old saying that no one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans. Sometimes I think that's true.",1
1374,"Do yourselves a favour and pay no mind to the critics, This movie is great. There are some awesome effects, great dialogue, the jokes are dialed down from episode VIII, are nicely placed and most are epic or borderline so. Episode IX deserves so much more love and none of the hate it’s getting now. The only criticisms I would level at it are the pace is hurried and this trilogy was held back by the empire as villains. The former is because JJ Abrams had very little to work with from the previous instalment and he had to build all the impactful moments within the confines of IX and who knows the why of the latter?Kind of wish the gambler had made an appearance..",1
1375,"The film isn’t perfect, there was no road map. Palpatine was essentially used as a means of ease explanation. However, the cast does a great job of handling what they were given. And the overall ending of the Skywalker Saga is okay, just like it’s beginning. Yes, there is a lot of fan service in the film, but that doesn’t really make it a bad movie.I think that if you’re only a StarWars movie fan you probably won’t like this movie. If you’re a true fan that has watched all the films and tv shows and knows a thing or two about the comics, then you’ll like this.",1
1376,"Reading the reviews here, you'd think this movie was as bad as Alone in the Dark or Rambo: Last Blood.  The truth is far different.  While it isn't a perfect movie, it is a fun romp and provides us more Star Wars.  I quite enjoyed the movie. I'm not sure what movie the people here saw, but this was a fun movie. Let's start with the first few minutes, it's just so quintessentially Star Wars, that you are brought right into the Galaxy far far away immediately. The story is good, Rey, Kylo, Poe, Finn, and all the characters have satisfying character arcs. The story wraps up nicely and through the whole thing it feels like Star Wars.",1
1377,"You know the scene from ep. 7, where they shoot down a ship and they say the junk will do. Yeah, this will do",1
1378,"This is a joyride of a movie. Packed full of heart, wit, and comraderie. Great message about fighting for the ones you love, not just against what you hate. The Rey-Ren storyline is fantastic, and leaves you guessing until the end. For me, the ""big reveal"" was not Rey's heritage, but the fate of Kylo Ren. Star Wars movies have always been messy and inconsistent, especially in the original trilogy. Why even bother complaining about that now? These are swashbuckling serials, not Great Art Films. Just get some popcorn, suspend disbelief, and let star wars take you away . . .",1
1379,"This movie is so much better than previous two. Surely this whole trilogy is nothing compared to Revenge of the Sith. But it closes all the gaps and just the story of Skywalker feels completed now (or I would say that they just finally finished raping their story). There are certainly lots of little strange plot decisions and Rey may be truly OP after all , but I really liked that lots of characters (especially Po , Ben and surprisingly C3PO) really got their personal development, while rest of the useless characters like Rose were almost left behind the story’. All in all, the movie is truly an end to the Great Saga of Skywalkers. And as for me they ended it much better than for example the avengers.P.S.  O would also like  to mention a truly great actor performance . Especially Oscar’s and Adam’s.",1
1380,"For what it's worth, coming from a Star Wars fan, I found the ending of a great saga to be nod worthy. Well done. Innovative cinematics. On par acting. I enjoyed the experience immensely.",1
1381,"This movie is incredible, it solves many of the questions of episodes VII and VIII, besides this, the plot of the movie is by far the most interesting, entertaining and emotional of this new trilogy of sequels, in my opinion, there are no boring scenes in this film.",1
1382,I loved the movie from start to finish. A perfect ending to the story I've been enjoying for a lifetime. Epic.,1
1383,Fantastic job JJ Abrams. Definitely fixed the sinking ship of Starwars. After the iceberg of a movie Rian Johnson directed.,1
1384,"By no means is this a perfect movie, but it was certainly MUCH better than The Last Jedi.  Filled with lots of intense action and fast-paced, rousing fun!  Also, I could do without the blatant LGBTQ propoganda at the end of the film...it had nothing to do with the plot and added nothing to the storyline.  Just an obnoxious social/political message.",1
1385,My only complaint is that anakin and Ben weren’t in the final scene to complete the full family.,1
1386,"Loved it, and I never in a million years expected to.  I am a lifetime Star Wars fan, but the new trilogy was falling so short of the bar set by the original trilogy it was really hurting to watch them.  Felt like Force Awakens was mostly just rehash of A New Hope and Last Jedi seemed like a mess to me.  Now, granted, this is not anywhere on par with the original trilogy.   However, with this film I finally feel like the new trilogy has an identity of it's own.  This one managed to finally give meaning and resonance to the characters and events of Force Awakens and Last Jedi.  There are cringe worthy cheesy and campy moments, and huge events are left glaringly unexplained, but if you just give in and go with it I can finally say it was a ride worth taking.  Feel like I owe J.J. Abrams an apology because I was so mad at him for Force Awakens.  I feel like he did a solid job of letting me finally see his vision for Star Wars and he did a good job in the end.",1
1388,"I cannot understand why everybody is so mad. Movie is not that bad, it`s enough. That`s the way, fellas)",1
1389,"A really enjoyable blockbuster with plenty of star wars in it. Charming, funny and epic. Some people didn't like where this new saga took the old characters, but this is in no way a bad film or a disgrace against star wars. Best one since ROTJ in my humble opinion. Anyways, stop reading these and go see it for yourself, make up your own mind about it. This new review culture is poison for enjoyment.",1
1390,This film feels like Star Wars is Star Wars again. It fixes many problems created by the last Jedi (a horrible movie and insult to the franchise). It was enjoyable and respected the star wars universe and lore. The plot is all over the place at times but that is largely the fault of having to be a grand ending to trilogy where the middle film of the trilogy backstabbed the first film and then shot itself in the head. Considering that it end the saga as well as expected. It was great to see an action packed star wars movie with meaningful events and developments that actually acknowledges and respects the 7 movies and expanded universe that came before it. (Unlike the last Jedi which cannot even be considered a star wars movie at this point).,1
1391,I thought this movie was just fine. Much better than TLJ. A few stupid things but enjoyable adventure.,1
1392,"I think I am close to what most audience views, somethings worked really well, and some didn't . I love the lore of Star Wars and any new depth into force powers or the Sith lore for me works.",1
1393,"It's not a good movie, but it is a fun movie. It's definitely not the worst of the series, and if you go into it with the mindset that you're watching a big, dumb action movie, you'll probably get out of it what you're looking for. It's clear there was no single vision for the trilogy and they had to frantically try to solve that, which made the early parts of the movie a total mess. By trying to listen to the hysteria surrounding The Last Jedi, they managed to make a movie that isn't wholly satisfying for fans who enjoyed that movie, and which won't be enough to win back fans who were upset by it.Still, it was worth the price of admission as long as you're able to look past the flaws and struggle through the early scenes.",1
1394,Was refreshing to see it was **** like The Last Jedi. I was afraid I'd leave disappointed.,1
1395,"Esse filme foi um dos melhores que já vi Nota mil, filme com batalhas muito boas e com suspenses ótimosO filme prende sua atenção e faz voce querer velo até o fim. Vale muito apena ver o filme!",1
1396,Comment section a pretty big salt mine lolol. This movie did a solid job at undoing the disaster Rian Johnson left them to deal with but Kathleen Kennedy and the others at Lucas should’ve had a plan figured out from the beginning on the whole story. Enjoyed the movie overall.,1
1397,"The movie was satisfying, and as a standalone film is pretty exceptional. Technical aspects are phenomenal and the acting is always great. The story has some pacing issues, and overall it weakena the story of the sequel trilogy in my mind. Those aspects dock the movie two points.",1
1399,"I was one of those who really disliked The Last Jedi, so my expectations were pretty low here. I know this movie is getting a lot of deserved flak for its plot and pacing, and I would agree that this is all valid complaints and one I share. However, it wasn't enough to make me not like the film. Action was great, actually interested in the title characters for the first time, and the scenes with Laia/Ben were very strong. This isn't going to be on my favorite Star Wars movie list, but it was still enjoyable for what it could do. Let's face it, this whole trilogy was buggered from the start.",1
1400,"I loved the movie.To me it answered alot of questions.Also the way they handled Leia was amazing with what they had to do.I feel to often people bash things just for the sake of bashing it.Go watch it, its 2 hours of great fun.",1
1401,"Not the best or worst in the series and has a lot going for it. The only thing that is bothersome about this film is it does feel a bit reductive and the big reveals happen in the middle, rather than a build up towards the end.",1
1402,"While their are some technical issues with the film, it is overall a very exciting film and offered a heartfelt conclusion to the Saga. Given the issues Abrams faced after Johnson's pitiful Episode 8, we all knew that it'd be difficult to square the circle in Episode 9.",1
1403,"It felt rushed but how can you blame this on this last chance to upright this trilogy.  The movie needed to wrap up an epic saga, fix all the things mishandled of Luke in TLJ, deal with disney's director change, yet still wrap a much better bowtie to wrap it all up than game of thrones managed in an entire season. Pacing is great.  This movue had me emotional at least a couple of times.  I will be watching this a bunch of times on",1
1404,"Der Film schließt eine Saga die ich als sehr Wertvoll empfinde, desweiteren ist der Film in sich schlüssig mit kleinen schwächen trotzdem gebe ich ihm 09/10.Sehr sehenswert.",1
1405,Hands down perfection for any true Star Wars fan. Anyone else is a goofy contrarian or soulless being.,1
1406,Thank you J. J. Abrams! A perfect ending to this story and a great film. Second best Star Wars-movie. Empire is my nr 1,1
1407,"While I wasn’t too excited to see Palpatine back and Ben dead, I still had a good time watching this movie. Seeing that scene with Han and Ben, the Force ghosts of Luke, the voices of all the past Jedi and all of the Star fighters really just made it so emotional. I was ok with The Force Awakens and wasn’t to happy with TLJ but i definitely wasn’t disappointed from this and I’m happy how it ended for the saga and i’m looking forward to the future on what the Star Wars Universe brings.",1
1408,"The pacing is a bit quick, and for a 2 hour 20 minute movie, ten minutes more to slow down a few key moments would have helped a lot. Otherwise this is really well made ending for such a lasting saga. Can’t imagine a better ending for the newest trilogy and it’s a worth while ending to cap off a 42 year long epic.",1
1409,"Frankly, I think this was a great ending to the series. It comes full circle to enhance not only the story in the prequels, but the events of the original trilogy as well. It means Sidious is not just some evil guy who became a Sith, but the total embodiment of the Sith. When he killed Plagueis, he inherited the legacy of the Sith Order, and he counted on his creation (Anakin) to be the next vessel, but was screwed out of that when Luke turned Vader. And in The Rise of Skywalker, we see the final stages of his grand plan-- and the side-track he has to take to get back there-- come to fruition. Now, some people may hate this, but I love that The Rise of Skywalker essentially turns the series into the tale of the final decades of the Sith Order, and the heroes who faced it. Aside from that, we get a satisfying end to everyone's story from the original trilogy. Luke, Leia, Lando, Chewie... They all get a proper send-off. The way they handled Leia's story considering Carrie Fisher's death was inspirational and impressive. No CGI Leia or anything like that (except one flashback, but it's necessary and very cool. You'll see.) They made unused shots from previous films work in the context of this film, instead. Carrie would have approved, I think. Especially when you see who and what she is in this one. Don't listen to the haters. There are a lot of people bringing their personal politics into this, deliberately trashing the movie because they can't stand some aspect of its production or cast and what they represent to certain ideological viewpoints. These people are the same as the hardcore Catholics who trashed Kevin Smith's ""Dogma"" because it offended their delicate world-view. Some of them hate Disney and actively downvote anything they do with Star Wars. Some of them hate women and rant against Kathleen Kennedy or any of the female cast members who aren't Carrie Fisher (thank goodness Holdo is dead, otherwise we'd be treated to rants about how she dares to talk down to men, again.) Some are just peeved that the old Expanded Universe was rendered non-canon and will hate anything new from Star Wars on that principle alone. The thing is, Lucasfilm DID take some of the best ideas from the old Expanded Universe and use them in these movies-- Especially this one! Did you like the original Thrawn Trilogy? This takes some ideas from there and makes them far less cringeworthy. Did you like New Jedi Order? Pieces of that are in here, too. This is like a great EU story after it has been stripped of all the fanfic and pet-character weaknesses. And if you're a fan of the current expanded Canon, like Rebels or The Clone Wars, this movie has some things for you, too. Characters from the past, ships you know, people who SHOULD be in Star Wars movies are in this Star Wars movie. Maybe not front-and-center. Maybe only in the background, or in a quick flash in a battle scene, but they're in here. They're here for the fans. I'm sorry, but if you're running around calling yourself a Star Wars fan, but then turn around and say you hate the prequel trilogy, and you hate the sequel trilogy, and you kinda didn't like Return of the Jedi because the ewoks were dumb, then you know what? You aren't a Star Wars fan; You're a fan of two Star Wars movies out of nine. I'd say that if that's the case, maybe ANH and ESB were all you're gonna get. Nobody's going to duplicate those two, and nothing else will live up to that standard for you. Personally, and call this ""gatekeeping"" if you want because it is and it does not matter, if you like less than half of the Star Wars movies, then maybe it's time to pack it in and stop following the franchise. It's obviously not for you. For the rest of us-- those of us who love everything Star Wars to varying degrees, but who don't hate any of it-- This IS great Star Wars, and we'll be happy to show you the door.",1
1410,"I truly enjoyed this movie. The wild highjinks and characters were very well done and the story ended perfectly. What do people want? Rey was amazing. I read some of these reviews afterwards and just don’t understand, I must be easy to please.",1
1411,"If you notice, all the bad ratings are only from the creators of these rating websites. The really good ratings are rated by everyday average citizens as the ones reading this review. I don't care what paid reviewers think. I care about what die hard starwars fans think. This film was amazing. I cried at least 7 times. A very great ending, only left me with a few questions. Will the jedi powers die with Rey? Will she teach children as did Skywalker? I hope so.",1
1412,Criticism is undeserved. Fun family film. Enthralling action. Decent plot :),1
1413,"Very good finale of the film series, not perfect one, but totally passable.",1
1414,"I would honestly give this movie around an 8/10 but because of all the unfair low ratings I rated it higher. First thing to understand is that this movie has a lot of pressure and heavy lifting to do, including concluding the new trilogy, concluding the Skywalker saga as a whole, and bringing the momentum of the story back after “The Last Jedi” slowed it down significantly. I will say though, the overall problem with the trilogy is that the story, I have to assume, was not clearly written from the beginning, hence why the change of directors had an awkward shift and we were got to see two different versions of a story at the same time, which was not pleasant. However, here are the positives and negatives of this movie, “The Rise of Skywalker.”Positives 1. Rey’s story arch is developed very well, and we get to see the conflict of the dark and light in her and they tie this in well with being Darth Sidious’ granddaughter. Her scenes with Kylo Ren are the best scenes in the movie, because we get to see their relationship develop more and the connection they have through the force. Their duel is the peek of the trilogy and, in my opinion, in the top duels in Star Wars, because we finally get to see how powerful both Rey and Ren are in the force 2. Kylo Ren finally finds redemption. We see this over arching story throughout the trilogy of him dealing with the guilt of killing his father. He comes to terms with his guilt after his mother touches him through the force and then he confronts his father through a memory and gathers the strength to do what he wanted to do since the beginning.  3. Finding out that Palpatine is all the Sith is an awesome conclusion to the saga and the “rule of two” which states there can only be two Sith Lords fits in to this conclusion. ( the disappointing part of this is that Palpatine never fully explains it)4. The Visuals are amazing. The lightsaber fights are epic. The unexplored parts of the galaxy are visualized well. C3PO and Chewy are still enjoyable. The planets look better than ever. The starship battles are pretty cool to say the least.Negatives 1. I’m okay with not explaining some things that are not essential to the story and later explaining them in books, comics, etc. But it’s not okay when it’s essential to the story. How is Rey Palpatine’s granddaughter? This is the main question, but there are manymore, especially about Palpatine that probably should have been explained so that we’re not scratching our heads till it’s explained in issue 13 of “Palpatine.” 2. Finn’s character has no development besides the fact that he thinks he’s force sensitive. Since the moment he took off his helmet in “The Force Awakens,” his character has been flat and not interesting, especially for being a stormtrooper. 3. Leia’s death is forced. I don’t know if it was because they didn’t want to mess with her scenes or add CGI to her but I don’t really care what it was because it felt like they just threw that part in the scene because they needed to get rid of the character. There are many other routes they could have taken but this was route was not a good one. 4. The final battle was a bitter sweet moment. It was going sweet till a little before the final confrontation between Rey and Palpatine. It was anti-climactic. We see that Palpatine has reached is full power and Rey, with the Jedi within her, reaches her full power. And then... SURPRISE Palpatine is defeated by his own electric. Seriously? No final duel? No epic music? Think about it this way, a big bad guy is built up for 8 movies and when he finally reaches his power he is defeated by his granddaughter blocking his electric Meanwhile, the battle above reaches its anti-climatic ending as well.  Overall, I enjoyed the the movie, and there will always be things we think they could’ve done better on.",1
1415,"Beautiful, touching, emotional movie with fantastic plot and characters! The fighting scenes and CGI effects were absolutely fantastic! The Rise of Skywalker is a brilliant movie and don't listen to the fanboys. This is one of the best Star Wars movies every created! From me it gets 9/10.",1
1416,"This movie was so good, I don't know what people were expecting. This is probably one of the best starwars films I have seen. I was so glad I saw it in theaters. The only criticism is it probably could have been 2 movies and not just one.",1
1417,Great movie.....love it........huge fan of star wars .........................................,1
1418,"Thanks to a talentless director and f..kwit Bob Igor, this movie not only manages to completely ruin the new trilogy, but also everything that came before it and what is still to come. This film was an insult to anybodys Intelligence, even for the those in denial giving this more than one point. Star wars had so much potential after The Last Jedi but j.j. managed to destroy every character arc possible. Rey could have been so much more but is reduced to being a Palpatine. Leia is a horrible mother (knows her son will fall one day and does s...t-all to prevent it). Luke, once a legend, now just a hypocritical d..k. Rose -wasted. Hux - wasted. Lando - why? kylo Ren - sadly wasted. The action was so bad and meaningless and poorly edited. Bad idea after bad idea. The icing on the cake was when Chewie finally got his medal. It felt like the film was taking one big dump on me, the audience and the franchise just before the credits thankfully rolled up.",1
1419,"Pacing - 7.5 - had an upbeat feel just like Episode 7Energy of film - 8 - they did a great job of bringing the characters to life one last timeStoryline - 7.5 some good little twists and a satisfying end Can't help but feel a bit uncomfortable with Number 8 - such a mess that really put a sour taste in the mouth for number 9. This  said - congrats to JJ Abrams for pulling this together and making it run as smooth as possible . Very nice work. A 7.5 from me. Not average, but above average, unfortunately not amazing but that said there  are some real gem moments. I recommend this movie. 7.5 ",1
1421,I enjoyed this movie and i think this is the best movie in this new trilogy,1
1422,"I will acknowledge that this movie has pretty bad elements such as Palpatine’s role, rubbish jokes, and that dreaded “Rey Skywalker” ending, but I can’t say that I dislike the film. It’s still a fun, well paced space adventure. As a Star Wars film, it’s fine, as a sci-fi film, it’s fine. I’m not gonna act like I don’t understand the criticisms, but I feel that the criticisms are a bit harsh. I’m mixed on this film as a sequel, but I’m fine with it as a movie.",1
1423,Was entertaining. Script was a bit forced. Visuals were great. 777777777777,1
1424,Don’t believe the negative reviews! JJ Abrams did a fantastic job sending Star Wars off for the final time.,1
1425,"Rise of Skywalker as whole was a enjoyable movie but with some flaws. The main flaws of this movie comes from the lackluster story & pacing issues. But if you can look past that then there is an enjoyable movie that to me is the best in this current trilogy. The movie is beautifully shot with great cinematography & the overall special effects are top notch.The characters like Finn & Poe get their time to shine & don't feel like side characters like in the previous movies. Even when it comes to Rey this movie has the best interpretation of her, as she is not a all powerful Mary Sue in this movie. She is more human with faults & shows more emotion than in the previous movies. As a whole I liked this movie more than I expected it too, it was a good Star Wars movie that ends the Skywalker Saga in an acceptable way.",1
1426,"I really enjoyed this movie. Definitely the strongest of the latest trilogy, but also in the top half of all the Star Wars movies, IMO. While not perfect, no movie ever is, and this one really couldn’t have wrapped it up better, regardless of the previous two movies.",1
1427,"This film was a pleasant surprise after the last 2 in the series.  It is humorous, the plot actually goes somewhere, and it is a fun watch.  All 3 of these in this series have a feeling of ""look, I am making a Star Wars movie"" - a superficial feeling.  However, this one is the best in the series - and I enjoyed both seeing the original characters and finally got a feeling for the new characters as well as they seemed more human in this episode.  Much better than ""The Last Jedi"" - and many more humorous moments.  The force (both dark and light side) is overused and has become extreme in power level - this needs to be scaled back - it's getting ridiculous.  Overall a fun ride and a fitting ending to the series.",1
1428,"Not Great, not bad. But its entertaining. Scenes pass to fast. Feels like a 4 hour movie crammed into 2:30. But that’s what happens when trilogy is made independent from each other. But the movie entertains.",1
1429,"7/10Summary: Episode 3 with a good director, producer, and writer. The good:- People actually die.- It tied together 8 episodes of problems quiet nicely.- It had great fight scenes that didn't have to result to lightsaber porn.The bad:- The first act was very, very rushed.- The Rey reveal felt a little convoluted when they tried to explain too much (let the fanboys get details from the comics). - Some of the aesthetics and scenes felt prequel-ish.",1
1430,Many plot holes yet great entertainer first half was quite ok but 2nd half was just out of the tatooine!Really awesome conclusion for 40 years of leagacy can be better!the time ren becomes ben i was thrilled!great to see all old charecters including harrison ford!just amazing movie!,1
1431,"As a last episode of new Star wars,It's not good enough,Skywalker was the most important part in Star Wars histories,Even the narrative is  mediocre but I take it,LightSaber and the Space fight is good enough for me,Hope the new Star Wars movie will come soon.7.0 Fine",1
1432,"I really enjoyed this film, was fun, and full of star wars nostalgia. Don't be so serious about others review, if you like star wars for what it is you'll ejoy this film too.",1
1433,"Best SW in new trilogy! Thanks Abrams for this masterpiece! This movie was very good, but ending should have Anakin ghost! This is Skywalker saga, not palpatine saga.",1
1434,"dont believe the haters who made up thier mind before going in....this movie fixes a ton of sins from the last jedi...is it perfect no but its enjoyable ...no stupid humour and more lore and history respect win win go see it. i will defo go again, and i hated last jedi big time but this respects the fans a lot more id call it a fix movie rey op fixed, kylo weak fixed, tons of other stuff fixed them more you think back on it you say to yourself oh yeah thats cool.",1
1435,"What an excellent ending!I was very sceptic, but this movie truly did what it promised, it ended this saga brilliantly.Good story line, new planets, mixed scenes with different feelings & awesome battles.The beginning went on fast, too fast in my opinion. In general scenes could have been longer & more detailed.Conclusion:Excellent movie with small mistakes. They've done a solid job and gave us an excellent ending. A must-see!",1
1436,Хороший фильм. Хорошее завершение саги! Сделан с любовь ко вселенной Звездных Войн!,1
1437,"Filme ok, mas é muito longo, o alivio comico não funciona e tem uma cena tipo nada a ver, vale pela nostalgia e por alguns momentos interessante",1
1438,"This movie brought me skywalker saga feelings. It made me feel so emotional and involved in the story. I liked the way the characters evolved so that the end reveals some points and make them seem right. I don't know how to describe what Star Wars means to me, but this movie felt like Star Wars to me, and that's what matters in the end.. Still, I didn't approve the exaggerated power of the dark side. Some points are left unexplained and others don't make sense at all. Good movie, but it's not well located in the trilogy. The whole trilogy looks like a direction fight.Honestly, I went to the movies to enjoy the movie and so I did. I didn't care about the details back then... But now I see how the storyline was somehow lost. This movie was an attempt to retell everything and it explains the inconsistent plot.",1
1439,"Real character depth and development unlike either of the two previous instalments. Rey is a real human being, she shows range, isn't wooden. Finn and Poe aren't mere side characters. Kylo shines. The plot is truncated, wobbly but honestly this is an improvement over the previous two films. It's more SW than either TFA or TLJ. It's not amazing, or anything, just decent despite it's overly quick plotting (which can be forgiven due to the need to overcome missteps in the last jedi)",1
1440,"The biggest problem that this movie suffers from is having to deal with the absolute mess that The Last Jedi was.But apart from the “fixing” of TLJ’s mistakes, the movie on the whole was really solid. They brought back the characters in a way that felt true to their nature, and gave an actually meaningful arc to the story. The only other big issue I have with the movie was - spoiler - Rey and Ben kissing at the end. That felt so out of place and I hated that they added that in. What should have happened is that Ben just disappeared whole Rey touched his face, but they for some reason felt the need to add a kiss. I’m hoping that a directors (Or fan’s) cut will be released with that change implemented. But other than that this was probably the best movie of the sequel trilogy.",1
1441,"Ходил на фильм с другом один из первых в России. И могу сказать, что это достойное кино, с некоторыми изъянами! Завершение саги, которая длилась более 40 лет... Звучит очень серьезно и ответственно! И по моему мнению, нельзя было Абрамсу доверять снимать такой фильм. В фильме мне все нравится, кроме диалогов и режиссуры! Вот зачем было вставлять момент, где в эпилоге фильма Финн со своей новой подругой скачут на лошади по кораблю. Этому фильму не хватило серьезности, везде какой то сумбур: то весело, то мрачно. Мне очень понравилась 7 часть Звездных Войн, так что мешало Абрамсу перенять настроение своего фильма? И самое тупое, это как Рей подходила к тому, что ее дед Палпатин. В 7 части мы узнали, что Кайло Рен сын Леи и Хана Соло, и узнали мы об этом без особого фанатизма! Все было идеально, Абрамс все очень круто продумал, а в 9 части так сделать почему то не смог :(Теперь о хорошем. Мне понравился сюжет, актерская игра, графика, и больше всего мне зашли способности Рей! Какая же она имбовая! Я считаю, что Абрамс мог справиться намного лучше и профессиональнее! Хотя бы сделать фильм серьезным, а не посмешищем! А еще Абрамс мог лучше сделать финальную битву. Он мог представить хотя бы 10 известных нам джедаев в виде призраков силы, которые дрались бы плечом к плечу с Рей против Палпатина! Представьте как круто было бы увидеть Йоду, Люка, Оби Вана, Магистра Винду, и других крутых джедаев из 1, 2 и 3 частей! Но вместо этого мы услышали какие то голоса и финальный бой, который длился 8 минут! Это позор! В итоге поставлю рейтинг 6.5, потому что это нельзя назвать очень плохим кино, приятные момент в фильме присутствуют и их много!",1
1442,"I tend to agree with most of the critic reviews I read. The action feels too fast and unimportant. What has to feel like the ultimate final battle between Good and Evil, feels like another one, and nobody seems worried too much (because everyone kind of knows the good guys will win). I thought it was cute and nostalgic, and the Star Wars universe decisions were fine, but to me, this was the weakest of the new trilogy. It just felt like a huge tribute to the old saga (especially in big plot moments), and especially, Episode VI, but there was little novelty that everybody had expected.",1
1443,"It is a nice conclusion of the Skywalker Saga, but a little rushed, why you certainly have see the movie twice. It also a pity that some answers will be answerd in a book, thats typical disney these days. For a casual audience it will  difficult to follow, because of this way,they don't read comics or books about Star Wars. But overal this was a nice Star wars movie and much better than EPVIII",1
1444,I enjoyed this movie so much. I am so relieved after the disaster that was episode 8. I’ve been going through so many emotions. Thanks to JJ and all the cast but especially Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley.,1
1445,Good film overall but disappointing in the end. Star wars fans will be disappointed with this movie,1
1446,"As a HUGE fan of the Star Wars Universe ever since I was a child, these movies have a sweet spot in my heart. I think The Rise Of Skywalker is an AMAZING ending to an AMAZING series. I found my self jaw dropped, emotional, excited, laughing, crying, on the edge of my seat, I loved the fight against good and evil, the secret relatives, the rise of the hero and I’m going to say it, the NOSTALGIA. It brought a stronger and deeper connected between the old movies and the new series that was so beautiful. Like how the fight scene between Anakin and Obi-Wan in Revenge of The Sith paralleled between the fight scene between Rey and Kylo Ren. Where the lava represented death and the water represented life and in Revenge of The Sith, Anakin is finally turned to the dark side, but whereas in Rise, Kylo Ren is finally turned to the good side. I could name 20 more beautiful parallels and nostalgic scenes, but you get the point! Just think, what would Star Wars be without those attributes? That is what makes Star Wars, Star Wars. So for critics to say there is too much nostalgia, or too much resemblance between the older movies is like saying there is too much Star Wars in the STAR WARS movie!!Not only was the movie emotional In so many levels, it was cinematically stunning!! When you look at a movie from a filmmaking perspective, the amount of people and work it took to create something as beautiful as that deserves a 5 star review ALONE! And no highly judgmental critic can fight against that. The redemption of Kylo Ren was by far the most powerful part of the whole movie and frankly, the whole series. Throughout the movies, Ben is just a young boy, fighting the demons inside his head. The amount of pain and suffering that you see Ben go through then to FINALLY see him free of it and turn into a loving and self sacrificing man deserves another 5 stars ALONE! His story is inspiring, moving and so FREAKING EMOTIONAL! It shows you that it's never too late and we all have the strength to fight against the evil inside of us.Sure, I do have a couple complaints against the movie, but they are only complaints because I wished for them to happen, like how I wish we saw a scene of Lando Calrision seeing Lea before she died. I feel like that scene was very much needed. But it does look like Lando was able to see her, because he was already there when Po came back to the planet and talked to Lando. So inside, I like to believe he did, but still, I wish that scene was in the movie. Maybe its in the deleted scenes, who knows..AND I wish in the last scene, when Rey sees Lea and Luke as ghosts, I truly wish she saw all of the past Jedi’s or at least the main ones, like Yoda, Obi-Wan, Anakin and Ben as well. I feel like that would have been the perfect ending, since she is connected to them all. But these are just things I wish that were in the film, and like Abrams said, you cant please everyone, especially in a finale and you shouldn't even try when making a film. And for that, I understand and respect Abrams and Rian for taking the journey to even give us this new series. We should accept what was given, not just so we can be at peace, but so we can truly admire and love the story for what it is and not what it isn’t. ALSO!!! I would like to point out how I think that the movie is called “Rise Of Skywalker” not only talking about the rise of Rey Skywalker but also talking about the rise of Ben Skywalker!! Yes, Ben’s last name is Solo but his mother, Lea is Skywalker, so in my opinion, Ben is the true Rise of Skywalker since he rises to the good side and is finally free of evil in the end!!! And its the huge connections and deep meanings like this that make this movie get 5 stars. The beauty, power, emotion and hope of this movie outweighs all of the stupid critics who are just too judgmental.",1
1447,"So I enjoyed this movie very much, and more so in a second viewing. I think it builds on what was achieved on tlj with small pay-offs like the use of force time and using the experience of finn in Canto bight to come up with a plan.Also I loved the EU growing up and this one is heavily inspired by dark empire one of the first comics by dark horse. Over the top but so good.It wasn't perfect, it had a few pacing issues, a bit frenetic, but that goes away after a rewatch.If anything it could have been a bit longer. But a very satisfying end of the trilogy.As a lifelong fan I am accustomed to some unanswered minor questions, Wich I like so we get books and comics and other movies tied to it, just like the OT and PT, who's boba fett, where did Luke get the green Crystal, what happens in the clone wars these kind of things.But the visuals. The visuals were so so good, the set pieces were varied and epic, lightsaber duel with giant waves, the throne room atmosphere based of mcquerrie awesome art, just amazing.we go to several unseen planets too.Finally I lost it when chewie growls in despair and Han's vision saying I know.Fan service? Yes! But I'll be damned if it isn't good fan service! And to really hardcore, read all the books and comics fans to boot. Well done!",1
1448,"The movie is a must-watch. It was a fun ride, well-worth the time and money! Great visuals, I'll probably view it again and again.",1
1449,Fans who don’t appreciate Rise of Skywalker also fail to recognize that the demands of fans for a neatly wrapped-up end to the franchise are largely the reason for this movie’s formulaic feel. Abrams really couldn’t have done a better job.,1
1450,"I can safely say I lived the Star Wars watching this movie. The cinematography is amazing, the emotions hit every note and let me feel like the first time I watched The Return of the Jedi. It finally made the new characters have weight, pumping the emotions even more.",1
1451,"I really loved this movie, it was a great ending for a great saga, it is the best in this trilogy and although at the beginning it seems a bit boring it just gets better for a great ending.",1
1452,"I can see how this movie could certainly split star wars fans!  I thought it was enjoyable enough, but I expected more from this new trilogy.  I feel it was unwise by Disney to not have a solid plan going in, and perhaps stick with one director for all three movies.  I feel as if that is it's biggest problem.  It seems as if the two directors tried to undo most of what the other director did in the previous movie.",1
1453,"okay i'm not a movie critic and i'm not going to look for the mistakes the movie has, but i'm a fan of the star wars and i will say that this movie created a lot of emotions for me. Star Wars is something magical for all of us. With this we grew up, most discovered it, others adore the original trilogy and don't care what followed, others prefer the prequels, others are sold on video games and the expanded universe, others are excited about animated (and now live) action) series. Others still like it, to a greater or lesser extent, ALL of them. Why; because ANY of their elements have touched us in a way that makes us overlook their MANY ""objective"" weaknesses. Stop judging the movie for its mistakes and love it for its benefits",1
1454,"I’ve watched all of the cinematic Star Wars movies; that is the nine in the series, and Rogue One and Solo. This was in my opinion one of the better movies. I also really loved Rogue One. I don’t feel as though anything will ever match the originals, because they started the franchise. What hasn’t been matched in the new films is some of environment and depth of the universe. Star Wars and films like that were intended to open to new frontiers and build imagination, and were also love stories. This new movie left me feeling my body tighten on thrilling scenes, and feel emotion during other moments. I didn’t have high expectations, but I feel this movie did everything it could do to honor the franchise and produce something unique  going  in, but",1
1455,It...is...amazing!!! The way it ties the entire franchise to a close it perfect and the action and thrills far overshadow both episodes 7 and 8 combined. This is genuinely one of the better starwars movie of all time in my... extremely humble opinion.,1
1456,Not sure what all the bad reviews are about.   40 year old here and absolutely loved it.  Great closure.   Way better than the Last Jedi. One of my favorite Star Wars films.,1
1457,"i think what a lot of so called hardcore fans find hard to seperate the new movies from with the old movies, is... Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hammill , Alec Guiness and James Earl Jones as Darth Vader (the main 5, as other actors at this time also helped give an authentic feel to this franchise) are such a tremendous force (pun intended) together, that the magic they create on film is nothing like what we get today... That alone has an appeal that carried 4, 5 and 6 to great heights. And its not cause their acting was the greatest in movie world, yet the chemistry between them is so electric and on point , this helps glue such an awe inspiring recipe for great viewing and also the fact the movie which they helped create was many years ahead of time. Too many imo take this for granted and carry such a massive weight of expectation that they're setting themselves up for dissatisfaction way b4 the new movies are even made. Such a massive job to take on these new films. I loved Rise of Skywalker applauding JJ Abrams a job well done to the max as this was a very very hard job to take on.Even though i clearly wasn't consciously self aware enough at the age of 2 seeing A new hope, this was the age i was when seeing the 1st Star Wars film. It's been such a presence in my life (as for many, clearly) its great to see the Skywalker saga come to a close with now a lot of excitement to see where the franchise goes next. Thank you so much George Lucas for giving us this amazing and truly inspiring gift.",1
1458,Great way to end my childhood movie saga is uniting together and our old legends passing the destiny along our new generations,1
1459,"Yes, there are some tips of the hat to old fans as well as hooks for younger ones.  Disney morals have been diluted enough to make this movie a thrilling ride. Made by folks who have read the expanded universe books, possibly played KOTOR and have used the inspiration to make a decent Star-Wars movie.  As a fan no movie would be a bad one for me but I can re-watch this one again and again.  No problems with this one.",1
1460,"This was the best of the 3 new films, which isn't saying much. Abrams just redid plot points from the original trilogy. Lucas' 3 films from 99-05 were better, especially the last one, since at least they were original ideas.",1
1461,"Amazing movie! A great finish to a somewhat lacklustre trilogy, certainly better than that TLJ nonsense!",1
1462,I thought it was good. Could have been better if JJ did not have to do some damage control from the last movie. Movie felt too fast past at times. Almost like they were trying to cram too much content.,1
1463,Critics are crying about the disrespect to Ryan Johnson in this film but didn't shed a tear when the Last Jedi disrespected Lucas legacy. The critics were correct that The Rise of Skywalker was a mess but it was much more enjoyable to watch than The Last Jedi which was even more garbage on story telling and disrespectful to the legacy of the characters of Luke Skywalker. I left the movie feeling good on Rise of Skywalker vs The Last Jedi where I felt nothing but contempt for the team that allowed that garbage to happen to Luke Skywalker.,1
1464,"I like the whole new trilogy, but I think that this film is the best film in the trilogy, its apotheosis. The plot is at the level of Awakening of Hope, and the characters are exactly the same, but this film does so cool three things: uh1. The atmosphere, in some moments of the original trilogy2. Soundtrack-Another brilliant work of John Williams, this is the only film this year whose entire soundtrack I added to my library3. The visual movie looks just gorgeous, on a level, and maybe better than the AvengersThe end of the film is exactly what I expected from this trilogy; all these three qualities merge in it and it turns out to be almost a masterpieceWATCH ONLY IN IMAX",1
1465,"This movie is a 6.5/10 but I rounded up.   It felt like a cross between Return of the Jedi and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.   The Rey and Kylo Ren dynamic is the strongest part of the movie.  Finn and Poe's bromance didn't work for me, both actors need to dial it down with the enthusiasm.  Palpatine's involvement just felt like a safe choice, but it somewhat negates the events of the OT.   At the end of the day it's a fun adventure that may have been trying to do too much in this movie but didn't contribute much to the saga that we haven't already seen before.    The Luke and Leia treatment were fantastic.  Lando was great.   Nice to see Chewie, R2, and C-3P0 have more to do in this movie as well.    All in all it's a fun fast paced movie that was in damage control that required it to draw from the past to fix current issues.    They close the saga out successfully, but ultimately fail to capture anything fresh with this sequel trilogy due to poor planning which rests on the shoulders of Kathleen Kennedy.",1
1466,"Very enjoyable conclusion to the story. The movie is only divisive to those who enjoyed The Last Jedi. JJ Abrams did his best to piece back together the plot after the mess he was left with. There are holes in it, but the movie was definitely more enjoyable than Episode 7 or 8. This movie is very underrated and worth watching. The negative reviews are backlash from those who  thought the last jedi was a good direction for the franchise and ignored the holes in it",1
1467,TLDR. I feel like the movie needs more time. It crammed too much. There is still some entertainment that can be gained. I still hate the fact that Darth Vaders sacrifice was changed all of a sudden.,1
1468,"Just came out of IMAX Waterloo. You know what? I enjoyed it. Heard so much negativity beforehand that I seriously didn't know what to expect. It wasn't bad at all but it wasn't great. Why didn't JJ Abrams do all three films? Really poor planning.First half is very exhilarating, so much happens - maybe too much - and there are quite a few crucial reveals. I have one major gripe - SPOILERS!!!!!!!!! They should have kept the Emperor as a spirit, in line with many past Sith lords in the canon. Him being alive and then fully coming back critically devalues the original trilogy imo. Devalues what Vader did. Final showdown should have been longer and more epic. But I loved the Sith planet and all the minions there. Best location so far in the series. SPOILERS END. Plus, not a big fan of some Disney flavoured kiddie stuff but it is what it is.Apart from that it was a decent ending to the series. The final trilogy that felt a little bit unnecessary in retrospect. But for what it is, I give it 7.5. I hope they do Exar Kun or Darth Revan trilogy next.",1
1469,"This movie was great. I loved it. It was full of action, new places, comedy, and emotion. I was also a pretty great wrap up to what was a story that was going off the rails with the Last Jedis addition. Stop being sheep and agreeing with the ""critics"". Go actually watch it and then give it a rating.",1
1470,"While not perfect, I feel like Episode IX does a very good job of both wrapping up the new trilogy, and entire story arc.  Easily the best movie of the new trilogy, it has the best continuing story with minimal time sinking distractions that are in so many of the newer movies (codebreaker, pod races, etc).There are some good new force abilities that are both interesting and fun to watch.  However, one of the new abilities that becomes one of the critical plot devices of the movie leads to a bit of eye rolling and leads me to give it a slightly lower rating.Either way, I enjoyed the movie overall, and look forward to seeing it again!",1
1471,Fun to watch and a great end to the saga. Plot may have had minor holes but the main Star Wars themes were there. Great time for all ages.,1
1472,Una película disfrutable pero podría haber sido mejor si no fuera por la película anterior que cambió muchas cosas de las establecidas en la trilogia,1
1473,I would probably give it a 7.5 but metacritic won't let me. Overall I enjoyed the movie. The story line was a bit too dense though. They could have made this movie into 2 separate movies. I blame the faults of it on Rian Johnson's treatment of episode 8. If he had followed the road map set by J.J. Abrams I think it would have turned out better. I loved seeing palpatein in this movie but I think the only reason he is in it is because Johnson killed off Snoke and they needed a new villain.,1
1474,"It’s a Star Wars movie, what do you expect. A few weird plot holes. But ultimately a movie which finished the story",1
1475,"Thoroughly enjoyable finale in the saga. Well made and executed, if - I would think unavoidably - somewhat of a dejavue all over again feeling. Still found it different enough and creative enough to entertain for the entire running time. The main characters are all very engaging, the CGI top notch. Well made finale to the 36-year-running story I grew up with.",1
1476,"Not quite the ending that you would expect from one of the biggest franchises of all time. I can see how this film has amassed such criticism but it’s actually an enjoyable movie. Leave your brain in neutral and you get the best out of the inconsistencies. The action and pacing are chaotic at times and the Character development and story telling is underwhelming, lame on occasion. The force powers our 2 leads have are really over the top and out of the realistic realms of our understanding in the SW universe. All characters minus Rey, Ben and palpatine are pretty much extras but The saga concluded well enough. Palpatines power is totally unrealistic but when compared to a villain like the extra snoke was I’ll take that all day long. It’s silly and a bit of an insult to us hard core fans but Abrams did give us fan service. Whatever anyone says. Cameos from Luke, Han and enough tidbits to keep the less cynical and negative happy. It was a noble effort and I think it’s a shame the critics in general have been a bit harsh.  This final trilogy , despite its many flaws, is better than the prequels. The prequels had a clear story, not so wishy washy but these films have done what they served to do in my opinion...",1
1477,"Still processing the movie. I was disappointed in the movie after the promise of the trailers. It was rushed, unevenly paced and lacked the emotional wallop one would expect (I still shed multiple tears).Saying that I still enjoyed it and I will see it again at the theater.TLJ messed everything up and I was actively angry leaving that movie, this just left me feeling a little empty, like I’d eaten a lot of junk food.I watch and rewatch all the Star Wars movies and have even come to love the prequels, so make of that what you will.",1
1478,"Almost succeeded to undo the last jedi nonsense from Ruin Johnson, almost.Ray is now training and fails her training, I am sold :)",1
1479,"Honestly, is the movie perfect? No, but there's almost no way to justify that this movie deserves anything less than a 5.0. I was pleasantly surprised. After all of the extreme negativity around this film, I was expecting the absolute worst. The movies are a fine send off for new characters that I don't particularly like. I find the interactions between characters to be interesting although I have limited interest in the characters themselves. Yes, the movie jumps around a lot at the start but it's easy to follow even as a pretty lapsed Star Wars fan. It eventually settles down into a film with a somewhat imperfect plot, but it's Star Wars. It's not a mature, well developed plot like Alien or Bladerunner 2049. Ultimately, it's a Sci-Fi movie targeting a younger audience and it does what it's intending to do extremely well. Far too much negativity over a film that is absolutely fine.",1
1480,"Ce Star Wars n’est pas le pire. Il a des mauvais points et des bon points. Le plus gros problème selon moi ses que J.J Abrams n’a pas assez de temps pour faire le film. Il a eu deux ans pour répondre à toute nos questions, écrire le scénario, tourner le film, les effets spéciaux, la poste Production, les décores et finir l’histoire. En plus au début c’était un autre réalisateur qui devait faire le film. Le film a de très bon plan de caméra, de beaux décors des environnement original. Le film va vite et la fin s’étire un peut mais ces très bien tourné. La mort de Kylo Ren et le retour à la lumière de Ben Solo ce fait peut-être un trop vite. Je n’aime pas beaucoup le retour de Han Solo pour convaincre Ren de revenir de côté lumineux, j’aurais plus mis Luke. Je n’aurais pas fait mourir Ben Solo non plus. L’humour est bien dosé et Daisy Ridley et Adam Driver son très bon. Ce film est un bon film j’ai passé un bon moment et je ne me suis pas ennuyé.",1
1481,"I saw the film on Dec. 23. I believed it wonderfully ties a nice ribbon to all 3 Skywalker trilogies. As a fan of the prequels, I liked how JJ Abrams made TROS similar to them, but with its own twists. The Rise of Skywalker was just a fun and enjoyable film to watch. Even though many very interesting concepts were just introduced in this film, I want to applaud to how Abrams tied all of it together, to make it the best that the film can be. The acting was phenomenal. My two favorite scenes are when Luke is training Leia and when the force ghosts are talking to Rey. However, I wish that we actually got to see the force ghost. It would've been such an emotional scene since characters from the past are present. The second half was my favorite. The first half was a bit slow, but be patient. I don't understand why many people hate it. A lot of the reviews I have read who hated Rise of Skywalker had invalid reasons or no reason at all. As JJ Abrams said...Star Wars is kind of like a family. Not all family members have to agree with each other, and so will trilogies or the franchise. It is a great movie, but the overall scores received are terrible. Although, that doesn't mean that the film is terrible. Audiences are overreacting. To all the people who are going to see TROS, do NOT get influenced by the bad reviews or coming into the theater believing its bad. Because if you do, you'll be disappointed.",1
1482,"I like this movie a lot. Don’t know why the critics are saying what they are saying. Yes, it is not the best, but it’s Star Wars and I love it. I have seen 3 times already.",1
1483,"This movie was a thrilling and exciting end to the Skywalker saga. It was everything about Star Wars that I love. Honestly, after the beautifully shot train wreck of a script that was TLJ I’m surprised this was so good. JJ pulled a miracle.",1
1484,this is a veryawesome star wars movie the fact that rey is a palpatine hansolo is in it and ben solo dies i love it the best of the trilogy,1
1485,"It was always going to be a tough crowd pleaser!Rise of Skywalker doesn't have the best story, plot, script or depth that you associate with the original (or even ironically now- the prequal era) movies. Is it the worst star wars film I've seen? No (episode 8). JJ did the best he could to rectify episode 8 and a lot.of gaps in the plot have been filled, just unfortunately with lack of true depth. I think he probably did the best he could given the mess he inherited. Disney- don't change directors with totally different vision half way through a trilogy!! Is it worth seeing? Yes, a couple times maybe- which for star wars is sad.",1
1486,"Definitely the best of the new star wars movies.  It did feel a little rushed in setting up the story line, but that was likely caused by RJ completely wasting the entirety of the 8th episode.  JJ picked up the ball that RJ dropped and brought the series to a satisfying conclusion without any dumb suicide jumping or Jedi flying through space.",1
1487,"The Rise of Skywalker is a solid film. Far from perfect, but close to great overall. The editing is choppy, and the character development for the supporting cast was the weakest link. But the heart of the film, driven by its main cast, shone throughout. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega both our in fantastic performances. And then there’s Adam Driver, who owned the stage and was mesmerizing in several scenes. The fan service (mostly) fun. And, chiefly, certain decisions, especially at the end, may seem cheesy or out of left field on the face of it. But really there was a deeper resonance to these moments that I fear may not be appreciated, at least how I saw them. There was a message that may be missed by your initial gut reaction. In the end, the film satisfyingly closed the chapter of the Skywalker saga. It tied things off in ways that left me positively nostalgic. The good greatly outlays the somewhat disappointing. And most importantly, the heart was always there.",1
1488,After everything the trilogy of trilogies has been through it's just unrealistic to think anybody could have made something that was going to please everyone. This was about as close as it ever could have possible come to perfect and I was entirely happy with it from beginning to end.,1
1489,"Loved the end of the saga, less happy with how some characters just got tossed like rose and hux, but epic visuals, and epic tie into the emperor.  Loved loved loved hearing the voices of all the jedi during the final battle.",1
1490,i thought the movie was great. i enjoy the 2+ hours i was there.  cannot wait for the dvd to come out. i been reading the negatives.  not sure what they all wanted. it did make a full circle with respect to skywalker if you saw the very first one they you will understand the ending of this one. special effects where great.  i think they left if open for future movies maybe way down the road because there will always be the one bad guy sooner of later.,1
1491,"As a life long Star Wars fan I can honestly say The Rise of Skywalker with flaws is without a doubt the best in the new trilogy, the action set pieces and tone of sheer wonderment are something to be in awe of. I went into the movie skeptical after reading many reviews and seeing some reactions but I can truly say I enjoyed this movie the entire time flaws and all.",1
1492,"TROS is definitely an improvement over TLJ.The actors have better chemistry and more well-written characters. The plot is just ""okay"" and propped up with a lot of spectacle and action - think the final battle from Aquaman.I could nitpick some aspects of the film, but really this film suffers from 1) following TLJ, and 2) being part of a trilogy that was started without any real plan.Overall, I had fun and was entertained.Don't go in expecting Endgame, and you should be happy. Or, if you hated TLJ, you'll likely enjoy this one.",1
1493,What is wrong with people??? Blinded by nostalgia I suppose.  This movie was hands down a 10 out 10... up there with the best of Star Wars films.  Please watch it without being automatically cynical ... I LOVED IT!,1
1494,"If you were hoping this would be better than ""Last Jedi"", well it is! A lot of great scenes, some great fighting scenes and some emotional scenes. Adam driver is one of the best actors to ever play a villain. Everything I wanted from a star wars movie was in this one",1
1495,"This has everything that you could want in a Star Wars movie. It takes everything that was bad, and was poorly written in the first two movies, and actually gives us something that is satisfying. The sith are actually something to be feared again, the jedi aren't hermits who have no convincing story, the conflict feels much more like a conflict. This is easily the best of the three main line Disney Star Wars movies.",1
1496,"It is far from perfect. The breakneck speed of the pace and action scenes is causing whiplash and if you sit down and think (which the movie doesn't allow you to with this speed), many things become too easy to deconstruct and fall apart.It screams like this was 2 movies in one and perhaps it is as it is a clear effort to cover all the errors and plotholes and weirdness of Last Jedi.But it is also the first movie in the new trilogy that feels like Star Wars. Many aliens, other civilizations, colourful planets (and not a National Geographic photoshop), a lot of travel and exploration. And the fan service, while on the thick side, this is what should be expected when you are closing 40y of cinematic history. Most of it is nice and you enjoy it. I was particularly pleased with the humor which finally hit the right SW note. No idiotic Mama jokes and Marvel awkwardness, just small subtle moments that work so much better.Lastly, I am very happy with the way to see the return of the Emperor. It was a clear (and first!) love letter to the hardcore fans as it is preety much a tribute to the expanded universe and what was considered cannon for almost 30 years.All in all, while not perfect, this was the only movie in the new trilogy that I came out with a smile and not puzzled (TFA) or distressed (TLJ), and for that, I am happy.",1
1497,"I am shocked at the abyssal scores people are giving this film. Ryan Johnson completely got rid of all the Force Awakens plot points, re-wrote and restarted the story in the middle and left Abrams with a monumental pile of trash to make sense of within a single movie.  JJ Abrams pulled off the impossible with The Rise of Skywalker and made a surprisingly enjoyable film to watch from the hot mess he was given. Of course its rushed, of course its a mess of trying to tie things together. It had to be since Disney swapped directors right in the middle who clearly couldn't agree on a script.  I came in with the lowest of expectations and was pleasantly surprised that it was a fun watch with many questions answered. I was shocked Abrams could even make something so enjoyable from hot garbage. Its far from perfect as a film but its definitely the best anyone could have done with the pieces given. The best description I can give is its as if Abrams was given two parallel universes to try and tie together into one, and the end result was overall messy but impressive. The cinematography is great, the action is fantastic. Much of the story finally makes sense. It really just left me wishing that Abrams had direction over the second film as everything would have had more time to be tied together and less rushed.   All in all, I'd highly recommend the movie to anyone who wants a good action film in the Star Wars universe.",1
1498,"Definitely better than 'The Last Jedi'. Even though the plot feels rushed (because the previous did not have a proper story at all) and the film featuring some cringy scenes, it still delivers in the end.Fight scenes were good, music of course, camera work too.There were also some good twists and powerful scenes with Rey and Ben.You should see it.",1
1499,"I really loved the movie. A a star wars fan I really appreciated how they fixed the mistakes made in the last Jedi. This film marks the conclusion of a saga that marked my childhood and teenhood, with a great and epic ending for the saga.",1
1500,"This movie is nowhere near as bad as the ratings suggest. I get it, many fans are unhappy, particularly with the 'Disney takeover' and JJ Abrams involvement but I'm not seeing much objective comment here. I've followed the saga fron the start, saw A New Hope as an 8 year old, and obviously am a fair bit older now. In my book, only episode IV and V are truly great movies, the rest are patchy, with some of the prequels being truly poor. Has anyone seen Revenge Of The Sith recently? Now THATS garbage, the key movie in the saga ruined. Through that lens, ROTS is way better. Kylo and Rey's arcs actually do have some emotional weight. Some of the planet sequences are breathtaking - saber battle in a raging sea? Epic. There were some fun moments too, actual humor and some good character additions (that little Baba guy was hilarious).Yes there is some fan service going on here, Abrams was trying to go back to first principles and produce something that honours the better parts of the saga. Ok, there are some dumb moments but it's nowhere near as dumb as TLJ.Lastly, I was lucky enough to watch this with my own 8 year old, who also loves star wars and I must admit to having a lump in my throat in the final scenes. Anyway, he loved the film, and for me that's the only review I'd give any weight to.",1
1501,"Having grown up with Star Wars films all my life, I have to say that this film was absolaurely fantastic. Very emotional and a fantastic way to tie up all the issues that the last Jedi threw at us. So so happy with it!!",1
1502,"I thought it was decent. I know it's a trend to bash the new Star Wars trilogy, but if you enjoyed the other 2 you'll enjoy this. If you didn't enjoy the other 2 you're probably forgetting how bad some of the the other Star Wars stuff is.",1
1503,"There were some really great moments, but there were also some really dumb moments. My main problem were the plot holes and the retconning of what I felt was the most important message of The Last Jedi, that the force can spring up anywhere. That you don’t have to be from a special family to be strong with the force.",1
1504,"Felt rushed and had some flaws - despite that I enjoyed the film. Was no where near perfect but was also a far cry from the death cries the Reviewers are putting out.Was enjoyable overall and despite some issues I would have changed, it did the best job it could and I also enjoyed all the actors as they did a fine job, too.",1
1505,"The movie was great, epic, emotional and satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga.",1
1506,"With it's fair share of flaws, this film is a lot of fun. I left the theatre smiling and eagely talking about it with my friends :)",1
1507,"After the ketchup ice cream that was TLJ, JJ and crew did what they could with what they had. However, much like TLJ (and partly because of the waste of time it was) a lot of emotional moments fell flat and didn’t seem earned. Also Maz Kanata looked better in TFA....it was really jarring when she was on screen. They may want to touch her up before home theater release.",1
1508,"Technically, the movie tries to pick itself from things settled in the previous entry. In the process, it tries to emulate a lot of the other movies of previous Star Wars trilogies but falls short of the ultimate potential it could have had. The characterizations in the plot did take a hit, once things seemingly felt having taken the course correction from The Last Jedi's plot elements. The Skywalkers become relevant all of a sudden, a tad above. That should have been the case right from the start, perhaps. The death of the characters in the previous entries permeates well into the third, affecting the final entry in the process.The director pulls of a feat to make it relevant and explores the safest territory to get this movie to the fans. I wont be surprised one bit, if fans approved of this movie more than the critically revered The Last Jedi. I had a lower score awarded to that movie.",1
1509,"Hmm, I'm surprised that so many people didn't like this episode, because after I the movie finished I was feeling excited and satisfied( unlike after watching episode 8 I was furious) 3 out 4 of my friends liked it, 2 of them fell in love( to be fair that also liked episode 8). At the same time, there another friend totally disliked the movie, he points out the moments that were lacking sense and it was hard to not agree with him. Nevertheless, he admits that episode 9 is better than episode 8. Honestly, I don't know why I liked the movie so much because it really has weak moments, but it also has really strong and cool moments, and that why I think I liked it more. Maybe after rewatching the movie I will change my grade but I don't think it will be too much different.",1
1510,"Loved it, as did everyone I attended with. A perfect popcorn movie and fitting end to the Skywalker trilogies.",1
1511,"Llore en muchas escenas, sobre todo en las de Rey. Igualmente en el desenlace  no llegué emocionarme, incluso hubo dos giros de guión que se podían predecir. En general es bastante entretenida, y algunos momentos rozan la épica.I cried in many scenes, especially in Rey's. Also in the outcome I did not get excited, there were even two script twists that could be predicted.",1
1512,"Not the best, not bad. But when you have to follow up the last mess, what can you do? C+/B- for salvaging it so it wasn't a complete mess. Biggest cons is that it was a little all over the place. Too many plot lines make it feel chaotic. The action was entertaining but the ending was a bit silly.",1
1513,"This movie is being dragged through the mud for what seems to be no actual cinematic reasons because of just how sensitive the subject is. What I saw in the theater last night, along with countless fans everywhere, was not a flop of a movie. It was a movie that was the essence of Star Wars. With amazing fan service that warmed the nostalgia in my heart, powerful visuals that made for wonderful light-saber duels, and a sweeping sense of ""we're all in this together"" paired with the importance of family lines.What this movie did lack wasn't nearly as extreme as others are making it in their click-bait reviews stating ""worst movie ever made"". It was a bit rushed, missing some background for side-plots, and lacking a tiny bit in the artistry of cinema; all of which can be explained... The Last Jedi was exactly flip-flopped last year of who was happy with it. Critics loved it but fans hated it. Take a look at the reviews. I loved it for what it was and although there were some unexplained force aspects, isn't that the joy of Star Wars and movies in general: the mystery. Not everything needs a manual on why it's possible especially when we're talking about the force, light-speed, and other made-up components. What TLJ lacked in these plot points and force explanation, it made up for in such a beautiful display of artistic scenes. Although I loved TLJ, it didn't setup the finale very well which caused it to be a little too fast-paced. I would have loved to hear more about Leia's journey in TFA or TLJ so it wasn't such a quick scene here. I would have loved more blatant artistry (ie. Red Room) in Rise of Skywalker, but Abrams used Rey and Kylo's ""Force-time"" chats and water fight scenes for artistry instead.Let's be clear, the mistake here was deciding not to have one director for all 3 or even both of them for all 3. The struggle we're seeing is a struggle of directorial difference, not one of good movie vs. bad movie. I hate that movies like this are ruined by people who have their checklist of 100 things they need to happen to be please. Just go to movies and enjoy them for what they are. Not to say there aren't bad movies, because let's not forget Playmobil came out with a movie, but there is certainly a movie here that is being placed critically below Jumanji 2 and Zombieland 2. Get your **** together reviewers and critics.",1
1514,"Dont listen to the critics, its a great Star Wars movie and a great end to the saga.",1
1515,"Take negative reviews with a grain of salt. People complained about Force Awakens being too close of a story to New Hope, then blasted Last Jedi for changing the formula. It's near impossible to satisfy Star Wars fans. This is a good movie and fitting end to the Star Wars saga which definitely plays it safe and can be choppy at times.",1
1516,"This review is not an easy one for me, especially since I struggled with finding something good about the movie. I had to watch it twice in order to realize what my impressions actually are about it.On my first watch, the movie left me mostly impassible while the story rolled in such a convoluted and disjointed way. The opening crawl left me off guard with its unbelievably awful plot twist reveal (though the trailers had hinted at the return of an important character); the action lacked any sense of danger and gravitas, as if it was all a walk in the park; some characters were severely mishandled and the one major revelation felt like a joke.On my second watch, maybe due to the resignation, I managed to enjoy the movie more. I could easily move past the jarring parts and let the show ride me through the emotional roller coaster offered. Thanks to this, I was able to uncover the positive aspects of the production.This movie works thanks to the three main characters, whom we see all together in the same frame for the first time. If more of this trio was shown in the previous installments, their scenes together would have more emotional impact. This movie works for the confrontations between Rey and Kylo, their connection and the way the Force is used in those moments (I actually loved this aspect). This movie works also for Kylo Ren, his performance and the choice he makes.Nevertheless, the fact the movie is constantly trying to patch up what was done in Episode VIII (pointlessly, imo) and that there was no plan since the beginning on how the story was going to unfold, bogs down the tone and pace of the movie. The repeated action setpieces of the past movies is also something we could have done without.Overall, this movie as well as the whole sequel trilogy feels like a missed opportunity for exploring new characters, new worlds and new situations. The excessive fan-service, the lack of originality (or guts?) and the absence of a clear direction is what dooms to oblivion big sagas like this one.I give this score not just to the movie, which still manages to deliver his pure, child-like intentions, but to the whole sequel trilogy, in the hope Lucasfilm and Disney will find the strength to dare and plan.",1
1517,"The movie was well done and many of the things fans have come to expect are all here: great visuals, great music, solid acting, and a breathtaking story.",1
1518,"First off, don't listen to the critics/fans on either ends of the spectrum who have been prone to hyperbole and will always rate it either a 0 or a 10. This isn't a 0 movie nor is it a 10 movie. This isn't be best Star Wars movie of all time, neither is it the worst.  Disney isn't the 3rd Reich risen from the grave and this isn't some SJW propaganda. But there are some big issues with Rise of Skywalker that can't be ignored. It's easy to tell that JJ Abrams tried to course correct hard after Last Jedi and it's just as easy to tell that the trilogy as a whole suffered from not having a single director for all three movies. The pacing is all over the place and there are definitely times where JJ expects you to just accept what is said or what happened for the sake of the plot and moving forward. If you're the kind of person that nitpicks the **** out of a movie for stuff like this you'll notice it and it might bug you. But dammit if I didn't enjoy it anyways. There's nostalgia bait and references to past movies and other established cannon, just a step away from the ""wink wink, nudge nudge. Did you see what we did there?"" type of references. The visuals are amazing and the spectacle is just as amazing. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver give their best performances of the series. The music is even more amazing courteous of John Williams which greatly enhances the movie and highlights how important a soundtrack is for a movie. Bottom line, Rise of Skywalker is a flawed movie that also has its shining moments. It'll be the most divisive Star Wars for a long time. Apologists will say its the Citizen Kane of Star Wars, naysayers will say it's worse than Attack of the Clones and neither of those are true. It's somewhere in the middle. Neither amazing nor garbage, but good fun for this particular user. 7/10 if only just barely.",1
1519,I liked Rise of Skywalker so much more than The Last Jedi. The plot and action were handled so much better. I was happy and sad with Rey's ending. A good and fitting ending to the Star Wars saga. I loved Rey so much.,1
1520,"This was a good ending to a long story of the Skywalker's.  I found it to be a fun movie to tie the loose ends together, yes it had things that weren't explained and at times it felt rushed. But over all it hit home as a starwars movie.",1
1521,"Not really sure why everyone is giving this film such a hard time, I thought it was excellent.  I saw this today with my wife and two children (aged 13 and 7 years) and we all loved it.  Myself and my wife, in our 40's, have seen all Star Wars movies from the 70's to the present, and there is no way at all that this movie was even close to the abysmal nature of the prequel trilogy of the 90's.  Of the new trilogy, this was back on track taking up from The Force Awakens, and far superior to The Last Jedi.  Star Wars first captured me when I was a young boy, and my son was enchanted by every moment and that is the best thing about this film - it keeps the magic for the children whilst still being satisfying for long-time fans of the series such as myself.  It is a fantasy movie and you cannot take it so seriously, just let yourself be a kid again and let yourself be taken on the ride of a lifetime.  Magical, enjoyable, nostalgic, feelgood and visually spectacular.",1
1522,"This movie was a blast to watch! Starts off slow & picks up leading to a grand finale for the saga. The ending feels like a satisfying wrap up for the trilogy and Skywalker saga as a whole. While mileage may vary with regards to opinions regarding story decisions, I know myself and others personally enjoyed this fun Star Wars story to its conclusion.",1
1523,"I would say, that they have finally made it!Truly a Star Wars movie! Enjoyed. Recommend to watch ;)",1
1524,"People are ridiculous, this movie was great. Everyone expects star wars to be perfect when not even the originals were. This movie is fun and definitely the best of the new trilogy.",1
1525,Excellent and brilliant film! You may have to watch it TWICE to fully understand but if you use your head and knowledge of Star Wars and are not just believing what is said and ‘what is written’ a true Star Wars fan will understand the Logic behind this well scripted and event plotful film 42 years in the makingPlease note the resurrection was cast in the short comic based events if you don’t understand read the booksThoroughly enjoyed Need a high IQ to fully understand the PLOTWell received Movie Ace.I have been a follower and movie critic for yearsExcellent execution5/5 STARSWell done J.J ABRAMS,1
1526,wow... i didnt really like ep 7... hate ep 8 but this one is one of the best... dont believe trolls and haters... its a must see and excellent ending.... bravo,1
1527,"Some of critics clearly don't get what makes a joyful film. This is fast paced, colourful, charming, fun, emotional and rousing. The storyline is engaging and the characters are all there. Nothing is perfect but enjoyment is priceless.",1
1529,Great end to the sequel trilogy! Very exciting but a bit too fast-paced. Still a great movie compared to the previous chapter.,1
1530,"Even though some changes could be made to the film, it is a fair ending to the Skywalker saga. JJ Abrams takes the movie and gets it into his path again, making it a classic Star Wars movie.",1
1531,"Not as bad as people make it seem, it was still a fun ride and I’m glad that the saga has now ended. Yeah I just would have done some things differently but I still think most will enjoy this especially younger Star Wars fans.",1
1532,"Great fun. Yes, it's a mess and all over the place, but it's the most Star Warsy Star Wars you're likely to see anytime soon.",1
1533,"The online reviews are too harsh. The plot is weak and seems to have been written by someone with ADHD.However it seems to be a film clearly done to please the fans and provide a conclusion to the franchise, and not to be a masterwork of writing. A very enjoyable basic IQ film for true SW fans that enjoy fanservice like lore (ie: datacrons) & force jumps.The huge problem with the film is its plot, which could have had lots of fat trimmed off it. The film feels like too much is happening in it, which gives migraines. But overall it's a satisfying plot.I suspect the bad reviews come from the liberties taken by JJ Abrams concerning the lore. Which I do expect to be divise. In a nutshell, imagine TLJ cranked up 10X. That's how I felt about this film. The fact that it still delivers a satisfying conclusion to the fanboys rewards it with an 8/10 in my book, because that's what was needed, above good writing.",1
1534,"A lot of things i wanted to see happend: holocrons, cool force powers, epic battles, sith planet, force ghosts, young luke and leia, restores mistakes of TLJ. But the movie is crowded, sometimes illogical.",1
1535,"The new star wars film isn't as bad as people say it is, and rating this anywhere below a 6/7 to me feels as though people are being way too harsh. The film must be judged on itself alone and not based on the entire sequel trilogy. The film has emotional scenes, amazing acting, stunning visuals and feels like starwars. It does feel rushed in areas but there is never a dull moment of the film. JJ did what he could with what he was given to follow story wise and you got to respect him for that.",1
1536,"Film in parte all'altezza delle aspettative con alcuni grossi difetti come la velocità complessiva di cosa succede, in più alcune cose non spiegate per colpa sempre della alta velocità e breve tempe della pellicola ma complessivamente di buon livello e con una trama ben delineata.",1
1537,"I had a lot of fun watching the movie and I think it's a good addition to the star wars movie collection. There was something fanfic-y about it, but that only made it better to me. It was so epic, kind of like the stuff we see in the expanded universe.",1
1538,Visually stunning but poorly paced. Still enjoyable for a casual Star Wars fan.,1
1539,"JJ Abrams and Chris Terrio definitely had their hands full trying to correct the mistakes of The Last Jedi as well as figuring out how to fit Palpatine into the story. The story keeps you engaged throughout. If you’re looking for nods to older movies and quotes and cameos, there are plenty to go around for the fans. Positives are the use of palpatine, I thought it was excellent, and the way he says his iconic lines are amazing. Negatives would be not SHOWING any actual force ghosts, just their voices. The final scene at tatooine could’ve been better with ghosts of Yoda, obi, and anikin.",1
1540,"It's quite the way to end the nine movie saga. I love the way that the writers learned from the errors of The Last Jedi and when someone mentions doing something Holdo would do, they are immedately told that it's a bad idea. The revelation of who Rey is compared to who she chooses to be is well done. Ren finds redemption, not by joining the Resistance, but by giving up the Dark Side. They even manage to get a few goodbyes in for old friends that have been absent.",1
1541,"The pacing seemed a bit choppy and rushed. The biggest and most glaring missed opportunity had to be the Sidious. If you're bringing Palpatine back, why not have Kylo (a Skywalker) be the one to put him away? Otherwise, I was very satisfied and genuinely happy most of the movie. I enjoyed how they fixed a lot of holes from TLJ. The action was enjoyable, visual effects were beautiful,  and the humor was done well. Fan service is a wonderful thing when it comes to Star Wars, I really don't understand why some fans would be upset from this.",1
1542,"The best Disney's Star Wars film. This is a true Star Wars film with all its elements, not as the infamous episodes VII and VIII.",1
1543,"The PERFECT end to the 9 (+2) movie saga. I was blown away. Go in with hope, and this movie will take you and your hope for a ride.",1
1544,"Excellent closure to the Skywalker saga. Only reason I’m giving it a 9 is because they had to do a lot of damage control for the last Jedi. It was exciting and for all that happened in the film it was easy to follow. It felt more like a sequel to The Force Awakens than The Last Jedi, and I liked that. Some Star Wars fans will never be satisfied, but I was totally satisfied with the film and I thought it was amazing.",1
1545,"THIS IS NOT A FAKE REVIEW - unlike SO MANY positive reviews for this movie, I am a real citizen giving my unpaid opinion of this movie - and I really enjoyed it! I followed the advice I heard - just enjoy it for what it is. I did, and it was a fun, well made Star Wars movie! It was a solid wrap up for these new characters, and did an interesting job tying them together with past films. Thank you J.J. Abrams and team for putting together this cool, fun movie!!",1
1546,Great movie didn’t see a thing wrong with it good movie to cap off the series,1
1547,"This is not a perfect movie. There are still some dangling plot threads, some rushed storytelling, some major plot holes but there is still that star wars feel to this movie. The action is very well done, the twists are engaging and the story finally feels complete. I applaud you JJ for making another worthy addition to the star wars sagaStill i wish anakin had a bigger role than a speaking role",1
1548,"Caveat: I am a life-long Star Wars fan and quite easy to please. Original, Prequels, comics, novels, video games, etc. Love it all.Having said that, The Last Jedi was the worse thing that ever happened to Star Wars. Just awful. That out of the way, Rise of Skywalker was a wonderful addition to the Star Wars story. It undid as much of The Last Jedi as possible, given the train wreck that was left. The characters were treated with respect, developed in meaningful ways, and viewers weren't assaulted with constant subversion of expectations. Go see it. Have fun. Enjoy a good Star Wars story.",1
1549,"The Rise of Skywalker is a movie that has a great soundtrack, breathtaking visuals and intricate VFX that fully utilize modern cinematic technologies. However the problem with The Rise of Skywalker begins with it's foundation. You can make the perfect movie that can please everyone but given a poor foundation, the experience can become bitter sweet. This occurs because of The Last Jedi which causes instability in the hearts of original fans who have been following every part of the Star Wars saga since the beginning of the franchise. To end the saga is a beckoning challenge, unfortunately this becomes ever so difficult when a poor movie is left to be retold through its future counterpart. With this issue, if you have ""two episodes of build up and one episode of conclusion"" , storytelling, character development , appropriate fan-service and mentions to nostalgia will come off as rushed, unfitting and desperate. Although J.J Abrams faced a very difficult task in applying these elements, Episode IX is not excused for rough story pacing, writing and direction but even in perfect nature it couldn't of escaped the bad reputation caused by the 8th installment of the series.The Last Jedi had set up The Rise of Skywalker for failure even before the next movie had been announced and created an imbalance between the latest introductions to the trilogy that fans could feel when they walked in the theatre this year.In conclusion, The Rise of Skywalker does check some boxes that make it an ending to the saga that most fans may come to accept as the movie ages. Although most cinema goers may find it hard to keep up with the plot of Episode IX, it can be seen that the movie gives great effort for the viewer to find conclusion in a galaxy far far away.",1
1550,"I would like to apologize in advance as I wasn't sensitive enough to notice any cons to this film. However, all I can say it's that I liked. I really liked. Full of surprises, epic battles and plot twists I did not see coming, this film is a nice conclusion to the Skywalker saga. Easily the best film of 2019 to me.",1
1551,"I’m glad that Abrams remembered there was an underlying story arc for the past 40 years and was not so overly enamored with his own abilities as an auteur, that he tossed the whole mythos aside. Thank you J.J. for valuing the franchise and the fans above the clamor of the critics.",1
1552,"I honestly don’t give out 10s, but I was captivated. There were schlocky elements, but I was too engaged to care. I almost walked out of Last Jedi and I thought there was no way this movie could be above average, but JJ Abrams managed to steer the ship back to engaging storytelling. I’m not surprised critics didn’t like this movie because I was baffled by the love for the previous film. I am surprised that the user score isn’t higher though. But whatever—it felt like a film made just for me. The difference to me between this and the last film is that I can forgive silly plot holes and logic when I’m emotionally engaged with the characters, whereas in the previous film I was bored by the story, turned off by the jokes, and had little to no investment in the characters.",1
1553,"Finally, some fan service! Very dark, powerful, emotive and true to the Skywalker saga. Fantastic.",1
1554,"Ok, so where do I begin? Well, firstly I have to start out with something that may be a spoiler for some, but not for others who follow the news. Ok here goes... J.J. Abrams does indeed rework and in some cases completely retcon a lot of the story elements that Rian Johnson introduced in The Last Jedi. No doubt in part due to the audience being completely divided on them. But also because Rian didn't really leave J.J. with many plot threads to work with all things considered. So he really he had no choice but to try and rework things so he can reintroduce ideas from The Force Awakens. However, there is one element of TLJ that J.J. keeps that has a HUGE impact on the story and the ending so I think fans who loved TLJ will forgive him by the time the end credits roll.As a result of all this though, the first 45 minutes of the film is a mad rush! It is so filled with exposition to explain the plot and tie things together from the first and second films in this trilogy that you can't even take a minute to process everything. But after this, the film does start to settle and get into its grove.Those who had issues with how Fin and Poe were portrayed in TLJ will love seeing them both come into their own in ROS. The returns of Lando and Luke were honestly brief but VERY memorable and added to the story in a big way. The movie magic they used to bring Carrie Ficher back from the dead to play Leia sometimes works and looks amazing, and sometimes doesn't work and just looks plain creepy. New characters in the film help flesh out the backstories of both Poe and Fin but do little else while Rose Tico isn't given much to do at all. The return of Palpatine does actually make sense though and Ian McDermid still enjoys employing the exact right combination of menace and ham to bring the character back to ""life.""But the main talking point of The Rise Of Skywalker is Rey and Kylo Ren. Both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver put in AMAZING performances and I'm sure everyone in the divided Star Wars fanbase will enjoy how their character arks end.While this film is touted as the last episode in the ""Skywalker saga"" of Star Wars, J.J. does add a few plot points that make me think that the saga of Rey, Fin, Poe has definitely not ended. It looks like Disney/Lucasfilm may be planning on doing more with Lando as well.To make a long story short, The Rise Of Skywalker may not be the ending this saga deserves...but it is the best we could have hoped for given all the circumstances. Best of all...WE GET ANSWERS to at least most the questions we've all had since TFA came out in 2015!Three and a half stars out of five!",1
1555,"I would ignore all the 0 score reviews, no way this deserves to be the worst of the worst. In fact, it is one of the best in the series. I thoroughly enjoyed it and had a blast watching it.",1
1556,Good fun.  Enjoyed by adults and kidsalike.   Expectations for these films are ridiculously high.,1
1557,"I’m 38 years old and have watched Star Wars all my life. I can see where some of the criticism comes from but for me the film had everything I could have hoped for. Action - laughs - Star Wars geekery. Brilliant and very satisfied. Bringing back the emperor made sense and the ONLY thing that left me disappointed was no conclusive answer to how he returned. Ridley and Driver were again the best part of the movie, fantastic acting especially together and the return of Han Solo plus young Luke and Leía albeit as a memory, made me swell inside :):):)",1
1558,"Absolutly amazing. This is Star Wars. The mysterious force, the good, the evil, Hope and friendship! Sure, Theres some choices in the movie, that we don't all agree with, but I feel like people expect EVERYTHING to be explained. It's Star Wars, it's supposed to be mysterious. Leaving something for the Imagination. Not everything have to be explained. It's the force and it works in mysterious ways... I can't wait for Disney and Marvel to expand this story through bookes and comics",1
1559,"Pacing is a bit too fast, but the movie covers everything necessary of the main plot, fills it with a tinge of fan service and plenty of action and ends with a satisfying ending. Most of the people spamming 0's are just troll reviews and fake new accounts",1
1560,"I watched the film earlier tonight with my son and both of us came out of the cinema with the same opinion,we really really loved the film.No spoilers here but I have to say I went in with low expectations (I really disliked The Last Jedi) but this film was so well told,made me laugh and cry in equal measure and it was everything good about Star Wars again. I haven’t enjoyed a Star Wars film this much since Return of the Jedi,I’d probably put this about on a par with that. It has minor faults but heck I’ll forgive JJ that after he opened back up some dead ends Rian Johnson closed in The Last Jedi,this was a great ending to the saga",1
1561,"Wonderful movie, everything I wanted go watch it. People need to relax for real",1
1562,"Nostalgia. Done right.First and foremost, if you're an older fan of Star Wars, the insignificant parts of this movie will move you, and maybe more so than what Disney intended for the ""all-encompassing"" story that you're supposed to focus on. But, that's okay, and that's what ""I"" and most certainly ""you"" need. With that being said, I only have two things to say.1. When Rey arrives on Ahch-To and you see Kylo's fighter burning, you KNOW the only way for her to leave is to fly ""Red V"" that has been sitting under water for years, as seen in TLJ. Then, the moment you see Luke raising it from the water, it just pulls your heart strings. I cried like the little kid I was. It brought back 5 year old me sitting in front of a square, curved SD TV watching The Empire Strikes Back in 1995. Oh, how I rooted for Luke like the hero he would become while realizing that his failure to raise the X-Wing made him human like me. It made him relatable and it made me root for him even more because ""we"" were witnessing his growth together. But, when we saw Yoda peacefully raise the X-Wing and say, ""That is why you fail"", it established a presence in Luke. It made him realize that ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE. It was a turning point, for us, and him. Because of this, when Luke raised his X-Wing for Rey, it was a passing of the torch and it was done wonderfully. I sobbed.2. Lastly, is this the greatest Star Wars movie ever made? Not at all, but it doesn't have to be. This movie does exactly what it should have done. It combined nostalgia, fan service, and a new story into a complex, yet wonderful ending that no one should be ashamed of. It is as if I am at peace now. At peace from having waited so long to see the end of this story. It could have been done better, but that's not the point. You need to watch this movie with the same mindset as when you watched the original trilogy. When you do, you can relax. It's a Star Wars movie after all. Be a kid and relish it.",1
1563,"The film has it's flaws and there were some choices I didn't agree with, but it's overall satisfying.",1
1564,"This film has many, many problems, especially when it comes to pacing. However, I can not deny how much I enjoyed watching it. It really is a fun film to me and I recommend that movie goers, especially Star Wars fans, go see it to form their own opinion on it.",1
1565,"I was not a fan of The Last Jedi and skeptical going into this but JJ Abrams made a StarWars movie for StarWars fans. It had all the nostalgia, lightsaber fights, and space battles you could want. It didn't try to be something it wasn't, it wasn't trying to be a statement or push boundaries, it was a fun and exciting StarWars movie and that's what I wanted and that's whats JJ gave.",1
1566,"good movie similar to episode 7, better than **** from rian **** jhonson, It could have been better but we can't expect much from Disneywars",1
1567,"Después de un Episodio VIII bastante flojo y arriesgado bajo mi punto de vista. JJ Abrams nos ha dado lo que los fans queríamos,pero...no muy bien envuelto. Miucha referencia, easter egg y fan service directo, sin idea original pero bajo mi humilde opinión no muy bien ejectuado. En cualquier caso, película disfrutable y entretenida.",1
1568,"Great movie! Answers all my questions from the previous film's. It is very fast paced, but I think it needs to be. There is only a few points I wish they have spent more time on. In my opinion, this movie is way better than the last Jedi and on par with TFA. Excited to see where the story goes from here.",1
1569,Don't believe the critics ... this movie is a lot better than the mess that was Episode 8,1
1570,"Even though I thought the Force Awakens was pretty good, I did not care for The Last Jedi as I felt it took the sequel trilogy in a direction that was not fitting. With the Rise of Skywalker, it seemingly did its best to mitigate the damage of the previous film by fixing both lore issues and plot holes. It feels more like a direct sequel to the events of The Force Awakens as opposed to being a direct sequel of the Last Jedi and while it is not perfect, both the writing and story are vastly superior when directly compared to The Last Jedi. We were finally given proper send-offs to many of our beloved original trilogy characters and even though the film, similarly to The Force Awakens, plays things too safe at times, the payoffs are some of the most emotionally satisfying within the entire Skywalker saga. Going into the theater I was definitely a bit worried, but when everything was said and done I couldn't stop smiling. Like Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith before it, The Rise of Skywalker is another proper conclusion that the true fans of this franchise were looking for. It gives the sequel trilogy some much-needed redemption and it is easily the best film within the sequel trilogy.",1
1571,A great ending for a great saga. Awesome action sequences and redemption arc for characters we know and love.,1
1572,"Loved it. There's plenty of comedy, action, drama, adventuring, and nostalgia (but not overbearing such). It's only problem comes from Abrams having to cramp the stories of two movies into one, after Johnson instead used Episode XIII to stretch two scenes into the length of a 2.5 hour movie.",1
1573,"I loved Rise of Skywalker my fav of the new trilogy - especially how it fixed the horrible writing of Last Jedi, in fact it may make that more watchable now. It’s got some great Star Wars moments in it, tons of action, explains all the questions & wraps up the whole saga nicely and good god is it beautiful to look at the visuals are amazing. Saw it on IMAX some parts were breathtaking. The script has some cheesy moments but I can forgive that, it’s clear J.J. should have been given the full trilogy to make by himself. Any ‘issues’ with the script are because they are trying to fix the problems that Last Jedi caused. I still hate how Luke was treated in Last Jedi & broke SW lore, but at least this movie tries to explain things in some logical way & link the whole saga together. JJ you did a great job with what you were given. Honestly I’ve been a Star Wars fan all my life and loved this movie.",1
1574,"I thought this was a pretty good way to end the saga. There are a lot of things that will make long-term fans happy, while also providing fair development for the new characters to the sequel trilogy (such as Rey finally learning about her parents).It felt like it was retreading old ground on several occasions though, with the way Ben Solo/Kylo Ren came to the decision to ditch the latter name feeling rather shallow. I also feel like some things were added purely for fanservice, such as Lando's rather superficial role and the scene near the end where Rey and Ben kissed. I want to clarify that I don't think the fanservice factors made the film necessarily worse, but they will most likely divide the fanbase.My biggest criticism with the new film though, is the decision to revive Palpatine. Not only does this largely lower the value of Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader's sacrifice in Return of the Jedi, but to me it seems like a lazy way to increase the stakes. They did an excellent job at portraying him as a menacing figure though, so I'll praise them for that.Overall, I enjoyed this one, but it isn't my favourite. Somewhat better than The Last Jedi.",1
1575,"Loved it! Fast fun and fan-pleasing just as Star Wars should be! As life-long fan, I’ve loved all the sequels. This one didn’t disappoint. It had enough of what I wanted and expected, and it still had things to surprise me. Only criticism is that it was kinda shameful to have so little Rose time after her set up in the last film.",1
1576,"En la nueva película de Star Wars podríamos decir que se logró un heroísmo por parte de J. J. Abrams. La banda sonora es épica, posee un despliegue visual gigante, sus efectos especiales y digitales son superiores a los de cualquier entrega de la saga, la fotografía es hermosa y tiene el montaje más versátil que jamás he visto en un largometraje... las actuaciones son excelentes (nada para el Oscar, pero se destaca el esfuerzo de Adam y Daisy), su historia es entretenida, además soluciona (a las fuerzas) el hilo argumental y narrativo que venía con huecos, incluso desde el inicio de la historia (La Amenaza Fantasma) y claro que no podemos negar que hay fallas, pero a nivel cinematográfico la mayoría de elementos funcionan, siempre y cuando seas un fanático de Star Wars verdadero; seamos sinceros, para entender ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" hay que tener muy fresco todo: cómics, novelas, videojuegos, series animadas, incluso hasta elementos de Legends que ahora son canónicos. Por otra parte, el filme está cargado de nostalgia, hay ciento cuarenta minutos de fan service en la pantalla, un guion casi predecible y con un par de detalles en cuanto a lógica que hubieran podido mejorarse. Sin embargo, los pocos problemas que presenta son de engranaje (sobre todo para el público inepto), y se deben al cambio de director/guionista entre los episodios de esta trilogía; aun así, no deja de ser una de las entregas más emocionantes de la franquicia.  Después de ver la película varias veces solo me queda una duda ¿Por qué los “fans” están decepcionados? Quizás los fans de Star Wars, como muchos otros fandoms, no saben lo que quieren, están confundidos y no lo van a admitir porque la mayoría de los fanáticos van con la intención de salir enojados sólo por costumbre, para sentirse únicos y especiales cuando en el fondo son un montón, pero la realidad es que la película esta divertida y seguro que con los años será apreciada como una “obra maestra” del espectáculo audiovisual.",1
1577,Great movie. Great plot. Great acting. Great ending. That is enough for me.,1
1578,"This is my favorite Star Wars movie of all time, my 2nd favorite action movie of 2019, my 2nd favorite movie of 2019, one of my top 5 favorite action movies of all time, and one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. The lead acting from Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, Ian McDiarmid, Joonas Suotamo, Anthony Daniels, John Boyega, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill was exceptional. Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Greg Grunberg, Harrison Ford, Shirley Henderson, Keri Russell, Naomi Ackie, Lupita Nyong'o, Kelly Marie Tran, Billy Dee Williams, Dominic Monaghan, and Billie Lourd gave phenomenal supporting performances. The visual effects were magnificent especially in the ocean scene, the final battle scene, and the scenes with Carrie Fisher. I loved the new creature and alien species especically the the Orbaks. I loved all of the new characters especically D-O, Babu Frik, Zorli Bliss, and Jannah. The writing and story was excellent. The makeup and hairstyling was superb especically on Ian McDiarmid, Daisy Ridley, Naomi Ackie, Adam Driver, Mark Hamill, Kelly Marie Tran, Carrie Fisher, Billie Lourd, and Oscar Isaac. The costumes were outstanding especically on Ian McDiarmid, Joonas Suotamo, Keri Russell, Naomi Ackie, Adam Driver, Anthony Daniels, Oscar Isaac, Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Kelly Marie Tran. The soundtrack was stupendous. Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker was so much better than I could have imagined and was a A+ movie.",1
1579,"A good, fun romp that left a smile on my face. There are a few plot holes you’ll have to forgive, and some stuff is literally explained in a sentence, but if you can get past that, it’s a rollercoaster ride that never felt like it was dragging. I think they did a good job of trying to tie it altogether after the mess that was left from the previous one. Definitely a high note on which to go out. I’ll definitely go see it again. :)",1
1580,"I'm very impressed with this movie.They managed to salvage the trilogy and repair a lot of the damage that was done to it in episode 8.It wastes no time in getting right to it's own plot, always pushing it forwards in a satisfying and intriguing manner.There is a bit too much fan service in this game, when it comes to the return of a few characters and places, but that's all quick and painless.The movie has a few jokes that mostly land, but more importantly, it doesn't make you cringe and experience Fremdschämen, as episode 8 did. Nothing in this movie was made to challenge Jar Jar Binks.They dealt with the death of Carry Fisher as well as they could. It can't be the same without her, but this movie honored her and her character.All reveals and twists are well thought out, make sense and are convincing, which is a breath of fresh air after the last movie, where they were just done for the sake of contrarianism and cheap shock effects. With all the possible routes that could have been taken,there is a chance that this movie will not make every viewer's  exact idea of what was going to happen next come true.But Episode 9 ends the trilogy as Episode 7 started it:By bringing respect back to the Star Wars universe and it's audience.",1
1582,"As someone who hated the first two movies my god this movies fun. I have one complaint about it and it’s so minor and spoilery it isn’t worth bringing up. Don’t let all the stingy negative reviews from “critics” dissuade you. See it yourself, it’s a movie so you liking it is subjective what a critic says about it shouldn’t influence you. Believe me I went in expecting to hate it and it’s probably one of my favorite Star Wars episodes due to some of the things it does. For me it did a lot of stuff that I’d wanted the trilogy to do for a long time. Go watch it and I doubt you’ll be disappointed.",1
1583,"Not sure what everyone else was expecting, but there is no way this movie is worse than TLJ or any on the first 3.",1
1584,Pulled together so many loose ends with a fee fairly clear story. It was fun and beautiful,1
1585,"Is this the best movie in the saga? NoBut this movie does not deserve the scores from fans who clearly watched the movie with the intention of hating anything it would be.Most of these scores don’t seem to be able to pin-point why exactly they hate the movie other than ‘Star Wars was ruined’.If they want to blame any movie, it is The Last Jedi to blame.With what The Last Jedi left for us, which was essentially the same overall plot of Empire Strikes back, except without the lessons from that movie and instead with our favorite Jedi, Luke Skywalker ready to give up on all of his friends and morals.At the end of the last Jedi movie, with Luke gone, no threat from the First Order since Kylo was a wuss the entire movie. He literally lost to a force mirage and Rey with no training or understanding of her power. And Snoke killed off for no real reason, there were no leads left at the end of the movie to follow for JJ Abrams to use.So with what JJ Abrams had left from that movie, he made an amazing and surprising attempt to re-right the ship that was the last Jedi.This movie is far more detailed than people realize, people saying it un-did things in the original or prequel trilogy clearly need to watch it again with a different mind set. If anything this movie stood for everything they did.Now could this have been a better movie? YesBut it was held back by what the last Jedi left it with, and that is why it is so fast paced. In reality it should have been two movies. One of the movies replacing the last Jedi. Instead, JJ was left with trying to make a movie to end an entire saga, and new trilogy with nothing of use. He literally had to put two movies together in one movie to end many stories, bring us a new villain since Snoke was dead, give us a huge threat to the galaxy to stop, give us a reason for Reys amazing power, give us a satisfying ending that justify’s Anakin bringing balance to the force in Return of the Jedi, and trying to fix our favorite Jedi and his principals and morals Luke Skywalker.What this movie did and pulled off was almost impossible and it succeeded with what it had to do.I just wish if anything The Last Jedi could have been redone, if that had been done we could have seen a very different plot, and dove deep into places we have never been.",1
1586,"Great way to finish the saga, great pace, amazing scenes, all your favourite characters appear and some powerful force powers used.. if your a fan of star wars, you will like this.",1
1587,This really was hands down the best starwars movie out of the nine in the Skywalker saga.,1
1588,"The movie is perfectly made from a technical point of view (music, visual effects, photography, actors performances). Also plot and script are OK and the movie is quite enjoyable. Two hours and a half well spent.",1
1589,"I will keep this short and to the point. Star Wars is not a planet, Star Wars is a Universe, therefore it cannot be contain in just a handful of minds. All the negative comments in my opinion are people who never want to leave the planet of Tatooine. The positive comments desire to go to the Outer Rim and the unknown. Well done, again, J.J.",1
1590,"There are certainly some things that could have been done better but the film is very beautiful and represents a worthy conclusion to the Skywalker saga. I highly recommend watching the film to fans of Star Wars and above all, I recommend going to the movie without prejudice.",1
1591,"A good movie in its own right but it had to be totally brilliant to fix the wrongs we witnessed in The Last Jedi. For me, it sadly wasn't enough but was was a thankless task.",1
1592,The best Star wars film in the new trilogy. Had some fantastic moments and some bad. But JJ Abrams did a fantastic worn with this one. He really did his best after TLJ mess.,1
1593,"The fan boys are upset about the lore of the Star Wars universe, if you want a fun night out this movie is perfect.",1
1594,"Rise of Skywalker had to be a difficult movie for Mr. Abrams to make.  This sequel trilogy had two different directors both running at full force in two different directions in Ep VII and VIII.  The last and final episode of the great Star Wars Skywalker saga shows how a great director and cinematic project team can pull off something amazing despite the disjointed story up to that point.  I have been a Star Wars fan for about 30 years of my life, and there have definitely been some really high moments, and really low moments in the series.  For me, and this is only my opinion, I thought Ep VII was trying to be too safe by copying a new hope.  Ep VIII had some cool moments, but I thought it was the worst movie of the sequel trilogy, that's due to my love for the Jedi story in Star Wars, and I felt that there were many wrong turns taken in regard to how Luke Skywalker was portrayed (granted I don't know what Rian Johnson's vision for Ep IX was supposed to bring for Luke Skywalker). Rise of Skywalker brought out some great acting moments by the entire cast of the movie.  The previous installments had some of the most stale emotional attachments in the series, but this movie corrects that (IMO).  There were a few new characters introduced in this new outing, and I felt that they were a good addition, and I enjoyed getting to know them despite being short lived.  There were a couple of romances in this movie, and while they could have easily been eliminated from the movie, I felt like they didn't take away from making it great.  Like others have mentioned, this is a movie packed full of story because it had to almost be a full story in itself, taking the ideas from VII and VIII and bringing that story to a close.   The visuals, sound effects, and soundtrack were all top notch.  The creative team on Rise of Skywalker took some creative liberties in regards to the entire previous concept of what the force is and how it is portrayed in previous Star Wars movies.  I personally think that their creativity paid off, and was impressed that I could still be surprised by the force in a Star Wars movie.  The lightsaber battles were really good, and I felt like there was a lot of emotion that went into them.  Space battles were really good, and had some real desperation to them at moments where you weren't sure how things were going to play out.  I like how Han, Leia, Luke, and Chewie all had meaningful impacts on the outcome of Rise of Skywalker.  Granted there was some backstepping that had to occur, and time taken to explain plot points from Ep VIII, but in general the Rise of Skywalker did a great job pulling everything together at the end.  It wasn't until the last scene of the movie that I felt like they wrapped this series up with a nice tidy bow.  I felt like this was one of the best movies in the series, and the only reason why I didn't rate this as a 10 was due to it being a bit too congested for one film.  I really think they should have made this final episode into two separate movies. I just love Star Wars though, so I could always use another Star Wars movie.  I hope that you go and see this movie because there really was a lot of thought put into it.",1
1595,"These reviews really show how metacritic is a joke. On the one hand you have people giving this a 2/10 (it's not nearly that bad). On the otherhand you have people giving this a 10 and pretending like this is a masterpiece.The reality is that JJ had to fix everything that went wrong with the Last Jedi, please Disney, address any issues or plot points remaining from the first two movies, be consistent with current canon, keep the movie entertaining, and make a 2.5 hr long movie. Since he had to do all these things this movie was never going to be any good. In the end we are left with a movie that suffers from pacing issues, throws so many different characters at you that it's difficult to keep track of them all, jams in connections to possible later movies, throws in the old timers for good measure, and doesn't end the trilogy in a meaningful enough way. Credit to Adam Driver however. In the last hour he says only one word and yet from his performance you wouldn't even realize this.In the end as a standalone movie it is entertaining enough. As part of a trilogy however its not able to make up for the problems that its predecessor introduced. No single movie frankly could.",1
1596,"I liked it and that's saying a lot, considering how much I disliked TLJ.It wasn't perfect but we knew JJ couldn't completely fix Johnson's mess is under 3 hours.Now, you can almost watch VII and IX and skip VIII without missing much.",1
1597,"Mucho contenido, bastante nostalgia, lado tubo una participación exlente. Y estubo bastante bien.",1
1599,"Don't mind the haters, or the critics: This is objectively a good movie. I have been in an emotional state in many scenes, loved the details, loved the story. I managed to avoid spoilers so I wasn't expecting how the story would unfold either. Is it perfect? Let's be honest: Not any Star Wars movie is, but we love them all with their ups and downs as a whole. That's what Star Wars is, it's more than just a movie or ""a"" trilogy and that's exactly why this marks a really good ending for this major arc of the main Star Wars story. I believe every true Star Wars fan will enjoy it and think so too after seeing it themselves.",1
1600,I liked most of all parts. Awesome CGI and tension during the whole movie. The ending could be disappointing to some people but quite good. More action than most of star wars movies.,1
1601,"Just see the movie, this days critics are drunk and don't have a clue about nothing, this movie represents what made star wars a classic.",1
1602,"A good movie of star wars for fans. All you can see in this movie it's about star wars, nothing more, no more casinos. Ty J. J.",1
1603,Just what the fans needed. The only reason this movie is getting “mixed reviews” because TLJ was such a failure as a Star Wars movie. Let me repeat as a Star Wars movie. It completely failed as continuing and embellishing the Star Wars lore. It ripped it apart to make it a good “modern movie”.,1
1604,There wasn't any way to make it the best SW film. So it's the best we could have.,1
1605,"The first half an hour is like an adhd kid off his meds and suffers because of it, but the rest of the movie is great!",1
1606,"I have seen the movie three times now, and after reading through a lot of reviews both negative and positive, I've come to realize that many negative reviews are based on people not understanding the movie - they claim they didn't like it because characters did this or that for no reason, when in fact if you paid attention there was a reason. Part of that is because the movie itself does try to pack too much in a short timeframe.  It should have been two movies.  But even without that factor, the movie is very comprehensible, just tightly paced.  Personally I liked the movie from the start, and liked it more each time I saw it, enjoying the many interconnections within it and references to other movies... to me I really loved the focus on Rey struggling with the question of going to the dark side, for a variety of compelling reasons, and her relation to Kylo Ren.  People seem upset that this movie upended some things from The Last Jedi, even though they were plenty happy about ""Subverting Expectations"" when that movie came out... A year from now many haters will realize just how wrong about this movie they have been, which is very sad as many more people could be enjoying it now without so much vitriol piled on it from a lack of understanding.",1
1607,"I will say that the new trilogy really shows that Disney/Lucas Film, truly did not plot out anything in advanced for the new movies. However, after the Last Jedi, I wasn't sure how they could possibly end the trilogy on a good note. Rise of Skywalker in a hot mess don't get me wrong, but I have to say they wrapped up the trilogy better than I was expecting.",1
1608,After being really disappointed with the last jedi my son and I went and saw it in 3-D and loved it.tllllll,1
1609,The best Star Wars movie I have seen since the original trilogy. Love from starting to end,1
1610,"This is a Star Wars movie for Star Wars fans, it's as simple as that. Yes I understand a lot of the criticisms being leveled at it from a critical perspective, but fundamentally, as a big star wars fan it was very fun to watch. People aren't understanding the near impossible job JJ had here. Not only did the Last Jedi leave the resistance almost completely wiped out and with no direction, he also had to bring together all 9 films of the series in to one larger story arc that made sense and involved characters from all eras. Was it the most creative  film ever? No, but it was never meant  to be. It was meant to give star wars fans a final send off to the setting and characters they have  known for decades, and it did that brilliantly.",1
1611,"Brilliant - often overly criticized movie. Tying up this epic saga was always going to be divisive and that’s clearly the case.  A warm and welcome return to the fast paced editing and afternoon matinee swashbuckling style of the original trilogy, and an abandonment of the prequels predilection for expansive explanation and indulgent back story to every piece of the plot!  It’s a fair observation that the first chapter of the movie sets the course that The Last Jedi didn’t set up - and corrects the sappy efforts at comedy and Disney reinvention that TLJ was guilty of.A master stroke of plot twists and and an ending that is satisfyingly vitriolic to a saga I’ve watched since I was 6 years old.In an era where being controversial in reviews affords notoriety, it feels as if that’s the motive for the other critics having slated this movie - I genuinely can’t find the same fault.  Perhaps attention spans are shorter? It’s true that a great deal happens - and it it’s fair that the two and a half hours running time packs an exhausting punch, but you don’t really notice the length, and the acts of this movie combine to satisfy the necessary emotions of revenge, justice and resolution - bringing balance to the force.The cameos, hallucinations and force ghosts are both fitting and welcome.Go see it. You won’t be disappointed.",1
1612,"While the film is certainly weighed down by the massive stain Rian Johnson left on the franchise with The Last Jedi, J.J Abrams was able to mostly pull through. This film was clearly written with the intention of fixing TLJ's flaws, as well as realizing the original intentions Abrams had for the trilogy. There is a bit too much time spent correcting the flaws of TLJ, but it was really their only option. All in all the film has the energy and pacing which made The Force Awakens work, but it is also much less derivative than that movie was, ultimately feeling like the type of sequel fans were expecting with TLJ.",1
1614,"It was fun. Went to watch a space opera and be entertained. I have enjoyed all 9 movies, and this one was one of the most action-packed ones. I went to see a children's sci-fi film that would likely have a couple of silly elements and questionable logic but would have great graphics, good acting, and a lot of action, as well as things added just for nostalgia (Chewie getting a medal). I got all of that. I love Star Wars, loved KOTOR, KOTOR II, SWTOR, and I am enjoying the Mandalorian. I don't see what's not to love about this film. Its a good children's film that keeps the amazing visual and fun elements of the previous ones. Its a top 5 Star Wars film. My only critique is that it is very poor planning to not have an overarching script made from the beginning. Drafting the script after every movie in a planned trilogy is ridiculous. JJ did a good job at making this last movie work, but Kathleen Kennedy didn't manage this well. Poor management throughout this trilogy that got lucky with this nostalgia-filled hail mary.",1
1615,"Best of the new trilogy! Thankfully, J.J. Abrams has saved the franchise after the let-down of Last Jedi. I wish he had directed all three, as it would have been a more coherent story. The actors were better than ever having finally ""found"" their characters. It's too bad Luke was sidelined, but that was the fault of the previous movie.  This wrapped up the Skywalker saga on a high note with both joy and sadness.",1
1616,"I loved it! It was the best Star Wars in the last couple years! This last Star Wars episode pushed all the right buttons for me, as a fan and someone who grew up with the original trilogy, I felt it was a satisfying end to the saga. There is plenty of fan service in this movie, which I didn’t mind at all as I thought those moments were done quite well, but won’t be to everyone’s taste, and there will be plenty of people who would have been hoping for something different. This final chapter felt more Star Warsy to me than the previous chapter and had some great moments. There will always be parts of these movies that will have you scratching your head and not making sense, but I think that’s always been there with all 9 episodes. Some great performances again from Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver who were superb in their scenes together. Anthony Daniels as C3PO was also fantastic in this episode, it felt like he had a much bigger role this time around and played the comic relief superbly. Overall the most enjoyable episode of the last three for me.",1
1617,This felt more like a classic Star Wars movie which is more my taste. Still think it would have been better if they just went with two movies instead of cramming it all into one.,1
1618,"ROS is an entertaining movie..if you do not have high expectations.  I saw the bad reviews, and therefore lowered my expectations a lot.  Therefore...I was not super disappointed.  There was too much action, which got tiring after a while, and not enough to story, but...it was an entertaining film that lots of casual movie-goers will enjoy seeing.  Hard-core Star Wars fans are critiquing the plot, and proclaiming the film horrible while..its not quite THAT bad.  It was just OK for a Star Wars movie, and at least ended well, so...7/10 is a fair score.  It could have been better in so many ways, but was still an OK film, and hopefully any future films actually spend more time on originality and story.  (I liked TFA, TLJ and Solo quite a bit, was so-so on Rogue One, which was very similar in having too much action and not enough story, but same way..was still an OK movie, and worth seeing.)  I would rate ROS...below those first 3, and about as good as Rogue one, but with the better main characters and the more important ""main story"".   Made to please casual movie viewers, but...not a strong story, nor a great movie.  But, not an abomination that deserves a 0 or 1 score either.  You can't please everyone.  but you should at least make the film what you think it should be, and not just cater to fans as...you end up with a jumbled mess of endless action sequences and ""chasing"" this or that plot item for ""action"" sake as a result.  Just a so-so 7/10, but it has its moments, and is worth seeing as well, even with its flaws.",1
1619,"This movie really exceeded my expectations. I came in and felt that this was just another Star Wars movie, but wow this was not - this was another level. I can call myself a fan of the franchise and have kept all of my Star Wars merchandise. I even brought my Princess Leia body pillow to the premiere. When I saw the epic finale in theaters, I couldn't help but think how the new trilogy surpasses the old trilogy in every which way. I would give it a 10/10 but the movie needed move Kylo-Rey kissing scenes ;) . YES, i am a reylo hardcore shipper:))))",1
1620,I loved the movie so much it was definitely one of my favorites in the Star Wars franchise. I wasn’t a huge fan of the “romantic” relationship between Rey & Ben but that’s my only complaint. Over all I thought it was very heartwarming and I did tear up a few times while watching it. I’m really going to miss seeing new Star Wars films.,1
1621,I loved this movie! Full of special effects and super funny. (And my wife liked it too),1
1622,"I enjoyed it, but with an asteriskRian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) is a mess at both a structural and thematic level; it spends 40 minutes on a side-quest that has nothing to do with the rest of the film; Holdo (Laura Dern) withholding her plan from Poe (Oscar Isaac) makes no sense; Luke (Mark Hamill) throws away his lightsaber (to hell with that scene); Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) becomes comic relief; there are resurrected flying space Jedi. And so we have Rise of Skywalker, which is a course correction if not a flat-out apology. And although I certainly enjoyed it as a spectacle, it's a deeply flawed film that feels like it was created by a computer algorithm designed to tick as many boxes as possible.The opening crawl reveals that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has returned, and has been manipulating events from behind-the-scenes for years. As the film begins, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is making his way to Palpatine's base. Seeing Palpatine as a threat to his leadership of the First Order, Ren is planning to kill him. However, rather than doing so, he watches in awe as Palpatine reveals a massive armada of hundreds of fearsomely powerful Xyston-class Star Destroyers. And so, the Resistance set out to confront and defeat him.Directed by Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams, with a script by Abrams and Chris Terrio, the biggest problem with Rise is that at no point does it feel like the culmination of a nine-film arc. Not only is there a disconnect between the three films in this trilogy, but there's a disconnect between this trilogy and the previous two, with the trilogy never really feeling like a valid continuation of the story. At best, it feels like a spin-off, with thematic connections and recurring characters occasionally shoehorned in to try to establish narrative continuity.Of course, a big question is whether or not Disney had a specific narrative plan going into this thing, with many arguing that the lack of coherence between the three films proves they did not. Especially important here is the return of Palpatine, which has been accused of being completely arbitrary. I can certainly sympathise with those sentiments, and I agree that his return negates Vader's sacrifice at the end of Return of the Jed (1983). However, there were hints in Force Awakens that there was a hidden big bad, and that that big bad was Palpatine, although to explain any more would constitute spoilers for Rise.There are also smaller issues with the film. For example, it treats death less than reverentially, with multiple characters dying, only to return in some form or another, which cheapens and undermines the sense of risk. The quartet of main characters also remain as insipid as ever – Rey is still a reluctant Jedi trying; Finn (John Boyega) is still a token good guy who used to be bad; Poe is still Han Solo-lite; Ren is still a moody emo. The biggest problem is that the film is built around the Resistance trying to get to Palpatine's base. To do so they need a Wayfinder, but to get that they need this other thing, but to find that they need to go here, but to do that they need a doohickey, but to get that they have to...you get the picture.For all that, however, I enjoyed Rise for the most part. Abrams and cinematographer Dan Mindel shoot the scenes in Palpatine's lair like it's a horror movie – deep chiaroscuro shadows, ominous caverns disappearing in the background, unnaturally powerful lightening flashing from above. Equally important here is David Accord's sound design, which features a constant chatter of unearthly and disembodied voices, like a thousand ghosts whispering at once. The scenes showing Rey and Ren speaking via Force Dyad are also excellent, as we see the background of one character's location appearing behind the other character, with the backgrounds shifting from one to the other as the scenes play out. A lightsaber fight makes particularly good use of this, with events in one location having an unexpected effect on events in the other.So, all things considered, I enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker and found it a vast improvement over Last Jedi. However, having said that, it never touches greatness, with everything feeling workshopped and focus-grouped to within an inch of its life. It looks great, and it's both exciting and entertaining, but it's also safe and predictable. And sure, you might say that fans rejected Last Jedi because it took too many risks, and now they reject Rise because it doesn't take enough, and there's probably some truth to that. But the fact is that it just never feels like a closing chapter. I enjoyed it whilst I was watching it and it's a decent enough Star Wars movie, with some terrific individual scenes. But as the final entry of a 42-year-old franchise (the most popular franchise in any medium in human history), it is, perhaps inevitably, a little disappointing.",1
1623,"La pelicula es excelente, me gusto mucho y vale la pena verla varias veces!!!",1
1624,"Was it the perfect conclusion I had dreamt it would be? Not quite. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the ride and have fun with it. Overall, I liked the previous two films better, but this one had a lot of great, emotional moments. Kylo & Rey (Adam Driver & Daisy Ridley) were the standouts (their stories/arcs were the most interesting). But ultimately, it felt like we had too much to set up and wrap up in a little over two hours, which made the end result not as satisfying as it could've been.",1
1625,"OMG! J. J. Abrams to the rescue... Without a doubt, this is a film with the spirit of the franchise. The visual aspect is impeccable, the soundtrack gives us goosebumps.Ignore the adventures of the previous tape (Luckily). A great closure for the adventures of Rey SKYWALKER.",1
1626,"Bad pacing here and there but good cinematography, almost every actor gave a strong performance, and the plot made sense",1
1627,"I'm not sure why it's getting so much hate to be honest. I hated 8 and this one was definitely better. I myself went on a ""media blackout"" as in I didn't watch trailers, didn't speculate on anything (learned my lesson with ep 8), and went to enjoy it for being a star wars movie. I feel like a lot of people have jumped on the hate train and are clinging to it. I think a lot of people like to act like these movies need to be something like The Irishman, and it has never been nor ever will be... Would I have changed some things that happened? Yes, there a few changes I would make with the ending, but that's my own personal taste. If you go in with no expectations and enjoy the ride as a star wars fan, you'll enjoy it. I went from almost walking out of episode 8 to thoroughly enjoying 9, and I will be going to see it again while it's in theaters.",1
1628,"Fantastic movie, JJ Abrams did an awesome job finishing the trilogy and the saga. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is phenomenal once again. 10/10",1
1629,I went in with low expectations but my expectations were exceeded.  I really enjoyed it.  Definitely satisfied with the ending of the Skywalker Saga.,1
1630,I'm giving this film a 10 just because it gave a huge middle finger to Last Jedi.,1
1631,"Reading the critics reviews before watching this movie was the best thing I could do, because I had so low expectations for this, specially after the Last Jedi. When the movie ended I was really happy and really satisfied with what JJ Abrams did gave us, since the circumstances were more than terrible. I know I am on the minority here, but for me this movie is the best of this trilogy. As a Star Wars fan, I am happy.",1
1632,"I was absolutely gobsmacked by this movie. It left me speechless as soon as the credits came rolling down. It was more than I expected. I was a bit worried beforehand when seeing the critic reviews, but once again I was reminded that bias and personal taste will always trump the opinion of an individual. What the one person might find interesting, the next one finds bland. I am an avid Star Wars fan, watched all 8 movies again (one each day) leading up to Episode IX, and I am truly amazed at how this movie brought the whole Skywalker saga to an end, and how this final chapter rounds off an extraordinary story. Do yourself a favor, go and see it, it’s definitely worth it!",1
1633,"I don't understand how fans can hate this movie. Real 2019 product here attempting to see a movie in the first 24 hours of its release just to see how much you can whine about it online. I enjoyed it. I think Abrams did about the best he could have done with it. Disney needed to have consistency over the trilogy. Ultimately, I enjoyed it, and enjoyed the trilogy, though I find things that I can understand frustration over.Average for a Star Wars movie. Still a damn good movie -- just not RotJ ESB TFA level.",1
1634,"Awesome.! Spoilers no. Spoilers without. Awesome.  Fun.  Those were the first two words that which came up in my mind.  Honour, thrill, hope, and, courage still live on as the third, to fourth, fifth, to, fifth, sixth word in my mind.  Not everyone else is true from zero to eight that the rise of skywalker that it is movie then and it would not be predictable with any character at all so fine only 7 characters' cameos should be the only reference to avoid more criticism only on from ign maximum it seems ""Star Wars: Cameos in Rise of Skywalker Cast and Sequel Trilogy"" for a tiny little post - little new years resolution goal.  And also this is not leaking and/ not leaking anything for the record in all  galixmulti and All  Galixmulti should all only be a thing only mentioned in the only new he - man and the masters of the universe reboot movie in believe early march 2021 whenever/ when it releases.  It has plenty of plot twists and nothing ever reptitive ever about the RIse of Skywalker movie and I ever doubt that ever less  than a quarter of a percentage would ever not want to go see the movie this movie right here and now.  Best ever  now in over a century to most likely over two centuries and or 5 five to 6 six of any to all centuries of any to all kinds.  Perfect ever score 10 out of 10.  Perfect score of 10 out of /10.",1
1635,"I feel like I'm in the twilight zone on this one. TFA was okay (better than it needed to be, as one review I recall put it, pretty accurately), but TLJ was fair to middling at best - a lot I liked about it, and a lot I didn't. Critics said it was the balls, bewilderingly, but whatevs. The Rise Of Skywalker is pretty much being universally panned by fans and critics alike, and I think it might just be the best of the three. Very flawed, for sure, and it probably benefitted somewhat from my lowered expectations (having gorged myself on reddit spoilers, I was already familiar with the outlandish plot points)...but overall I'd say JJ carried this trilogy, and while it will never be the OT, it sure as hell beats the prequels into Alderaanian dust. Time will tell, but it may have even retconned its way into making TLJ better. I mean, it's about spacemen with laser swords, lest we forget, and agonizing over whether certain villains should be dead or not is moot...that said, I would've liked a little more Darth Plagueis worked in there other than the passing reference, but JJ only had a couple hours to wrap up freaking Star Wars. Like any of us could have done any better.",1
1636,"A fantastically fun ride. Borrow some elements from the larger Star Wars universe that may feel foreign to the cinematic universe, but overall a well executed end to a big story.",1
1637,"Great film, did a lot of course corrections from TLJ which is nice, and considering the film it had to follow it did a great job. Its a bit choppy but very fun",1
1638,"There was a lot to recover and fix due to The Last Jedi.  However having to makeup for the last film and deliver the final, JJ pulled it off.  There is a lesbian kiss to appease the feminazi crowd the last film was made for, but the entirety of the film was for its fans.",1
1639,I loved it! It left me feeling very satisfied. It fit in perfectly with the other films.,1
1640,"The last installment of this saga is an action packed and emotional chapter that accomplishes the huge effort of bringing 42 years of Star Wars to an end.In The Rise of Skywalker fast paced action with almost no time to breathe gives the right tension and the high stakes that the characters needed to face in their last struggle. More than any other episode, this film shows how vibrant the galaxy is, thanks to the many beautiful alien landscapes that frame a high speed hunt for the big baddie. Despite the rush, weight is given to character's progression and emotions in the right moments, nevertheless, some might be left wanting for just a bit more time with the characters they have learned to love.The heroes' speed run across the galaxy comes with a price, since one can see some degree of scene skipping. This shows that the movie needed more screen time, but maybe a director's cut treatment will do the trick. However, this is compensated by the great interpretation of the characters, special effects and an amazing music score that recalls to all previous movies.Above everything, Episode IX is packed with references and continues stories and tidbits of not only the main movies but also the animated series. This is a clear tribute to the creators and fans of Star Wars and gives a feeling of character's continuity since Episode I. In the end, The Rise of Skywalker ends this book of Star Wars mythos with a strong and universal message about what is that truly defines a person.I am left with the hope that this is just closed a book of a larger saga, and that Star Wars deserves new books to tell more about the galaxy that has filled our imagination for years.",1
1641,"Despite falling short of a messy pace towards the beginning, I had such a fun time with this film. Phenomenal conclusion to the iconic story that is the Skywalker Saga. Especially loved the characters in this installment along with the comedic elements. Props to JJ and crew involved.",1
1642,"Lets be fair, episode ix fixed the mess of the trilogy's lore, at least it has more sense than before episode VIII & VII thanks to the movie's context and plot.Its not a masterpiece but is not episode 1 thanks godness, maybe even better than episode 2 . For me it was worth it, thats all i can really say.",1
1643,"WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!!Star Wars final chapter felt like an enjoyable journey, from the get go it starts with great action set pieces and continues through out, the new locations are gorgeous Disney really brought they’re all to make sure this film looked good. 2 hours 22 minutes is the run time and I honestly felt there wasn’t a dull moment it felt like a fight till the end and my eyes could not be taken off from the screen. Some of your favourite characters make a return in some way or another along with a very surprising and somewhat confusing twist involving a returning character.I feel there was missed opportunities through out the film most notably the choice of which Rey makes in regards to Kylo Ren’s offer to  join the dark side I feel if she chose to do so the dynamic of the film would have changed and made for a more jaw dropping and surprising twist then what we got the flow of the film was great and the final scene was magical highly recommend seeing it won’t disappoint",1
1644,"Not a perfect movie, not a logical movie. But an emotionally powerful movie that FINALLY gave Rey some character development and offered answers, even though not all of them made sense. Overall a thoroughly entertaining bookend to the saga (and yes I thought the ewok cameo was cute shoot me)",1
1645,"I really enjoyed this movie! It was a hude task for J. J. Abrams to finish an entire saga and we see throughout the movie that he had to repair the mistakes of The Last Jedi while continuing (and finishing) the story. I think we should all keep this in mind and give him some credit. Still, no Star Wars movie is perfect, but the visuals of this one are great, the lightsaber combats are awesome and it is a good conclusion for the Skywalker saga. So... just go see it and enjoy!!!",1
1646,"A hectic story, but this movie delivers emotionally on many beats; some is fan service, but some is actual depth. This trilogy ends better than I could have hoped after the last.",1
1647,"I really like the movies. Great variety of visuals, and the Star Wars aesthetics are just unmatched. I love this universe based on a beautiful philosophy. For all the plot-hole haters: The force has no boundaries, the only boundaries are in our heads. Reality is not what it seems. Even time is an illusion, and because of that the dagger can line up perfectly with the death star wreck. Everything is connected.",1
1648,"JJ Abrams manages to fix Rian Johnson's garbage, great movie, would watch it again.",1
1649,"This film is awesome. Most importantly, it feels like Star Wars. My only main issue with the film was the pacing but considering the circumstances, they did a great job",1
1650,"What an Epic Sendoff for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker! Absolutely the best Star Wars film, lots of throwback scenes from the previous ""Star Wars: films, Can't wait to buy this on Blu-Ray!",1
1651,Awesome movie!!! Loved it! Near perfect ending to the Skywalker saga. The movie felt a bit fast. Hard to digest the movie as it has so much content. Very emotional movie. Awesome visual effects! Wished Darth Vader was seen in the movie (somehow).,1
1652,The Star Wars GOAT. Sums up 40 years of lore and story in one movie. J.J. is a god and totally redeems what Rian Johnson ruined. This is the best ending anyone can ever hope for with nine films and different directors.,1
1653,"I thought it was amazing. This is what Star Wars is for me. Exciting, over-the-top, sci-fi fantasy fun. Not for boring old grown ups and Last Jedi fans (since it's heavy with the retconning). Critics say it's the worst since the Phantom Menace, but the fact is audiences had a lot of fun watching the Phantom Menace before the internet ruined it for everyone and I had fun with this movie too. It's a return to the old-fashioned, good vs. evil adventure story that Star Wars originally was. No post-modern subversion of your expectations (though it does have some interesting twists) and no bumming you out with real world politics and the idea that morality is a murky confusing mess. If you liked the Last Jedi or want Star Wars to be like Joker (or whatever else boring people who can't admit they like something that's kid friendly are into), you'll hate this movie. If you're just looking to have a good time and want better answers to the questions Force Awakens posed, you'll love it.",1
1654,"While not the best film of the saga, it definitely redeems what The Last Jedi tried to destroy. This trilogy would have been a lot more cohesive without that disaster of a movie in the middle.",1
1655,Amazing movie! Did a great job wrapping up the skywalker saga while also making the most of the new trilogy characters. LOVED it and that’s coming from a hardcore fan,1
1656,I am a long-time die-hard Star Wars fan. I found this movie to be a very satisfying conclusion to the 9 episode saga.,1
1657,"J. J Abrams, with sw8 as a burden, successfully delivers an epic ending to the boring postlogy. He had to do in one movie what should have been done in two, and in order to do that he have to define new goals and new ways to use the Force. Hardcore fans will hate it. But if you go open minded you should have (like me) a very pleasant moment.",1
1658,"The Rise of Skywalker is a satisfying end to the Sequel Trilogy and a conclusion that fits with the rest of the Skywalker Saga. It is rammed with action, answers, thrill, and excitement through from start to finish but suffers from a lack of energy in places, and the need to repair the probles that The Last Jedi created. It is a must-watch.",1
1659,"Fantastic ending to the Skywalker Saga. Not perfect, but really good! There is plenty of good fan service and plot twists. Worth every penny, can't wait to watch it again!  I wholeheartedly disagree with the Critics Consensus that rotten tomatoes has up for this movie.The first act was rough because he had to fix the issues from The Last Jedi, but the rest is wonderful! I am so incredibly happy that this movie was as good as it was. I wanted to be blown away, and I am!",1
1660,"It was a bit of a mess but still great. I'm honestly surprised to see bad reviews at all. It isn't as good as Episode VII but it didn't have nearly as much cringe as VIII. It had a beautiful ending, I'm not a fan of Disney's Marvel movies but it has been awesome to see a few Star Wars movies done right since RotJ.",1
1661,Really enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would. Far far and away the best of this latest trilogy.  Quite frankly I don’t understand the bad ratings.  Was it perfect?  No.  But I think JJ did an outstanding job given the hand he was dealt from TLJ.Will be seeing this one again.,1
1662,"closest to the original saga we have seen, while also expanding on our new heroes.  i loved it",1
1663,It has a frenetic pace.  It has loose ends to tie up.  It has to take care of 23 character arcs.  And the fact it ACTUALLY DOES that is quite a feat.  It's for fans.  Real fans.  True fans will love it.  Others may hate it.  No doubt it was course correction from The Last Jedi and its weird  character choices.  A fitting end to an era.,1
1664,Awesome story to wrap up the ending. Seems like the studio quit on it money and good filming wise compared to other films but the ratings on here are just stupid,1
1665,"Against all odds, JJ absolutely nailed this movie! I was mesmerised back in 77 as a 5 year old kid during episode 4 and again tonight watching episode 9, I was totally captivated, ending the Skywalker saga on a massive high.How our Princess was handled was absolutely perfect, the movie looked incredible, the cast were all amazing and John Williams score, as always, was consistently awesome. I left the theatre this evening with a tear in my eye and a huge grin on my face.My 13 year old daughter scored the film 10/10, my 18 year old son 8.5/10, my wife 9/10 and for me it was a perfect 5 star experience. I'm going back to see it again tomorrow, to once again take in that stunningly beautiful final Star Wars shot, in all it's emotional glory.Star Wars has been a massive part of my life and tonight the saga ended with me feeling full of wonder, awe and absolute total satisfaction; thanks JJ.Once again the majority of movie critics have demonstrated their irrelevance!",1
1666,Thank you J.J. Abrams for fixing the complete garbage heap that was the Last Jedi. This was a very good end to a recently divisive saga. If you hated the Last Jedi you're probably going to like this movie. My faith in Star Wars is restored. What an action packed film. I hope it's not true that they didn't have an outline for these three films or that Rian Johnson disregarded the outline. That would be insane. Great job JJ cast and crew.,1
1667,I actually had FUN in this movie. It was great to have the whole cast having ADVENTURES together. That's what Star Wars is about!,1
1668,This movie nailed all the right notes and is an excellent conclusion to the Skywalker saga.,1
1669,"JJ Abrams did the best he could and flawlessly did the impossible. Thank you, JJ. It was perfect.",1
1670,Best of the knew ones.  Overall I really enjoyed it.  The plot decisions felt right to me unlike the last Jedi Luke drama.,1
1671,Really enjoyed the film. I liked the plot. Wish there was more from this timeline because I finally feel like I’m used to these new characters.,1
1673,"This was a very enjoyable movie. One of the things that Star Wars has always given me, is that feeling of wonder and excitement. I got that out of this movie, and while I understand that not everyone likes it, that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of it. I really loved this movie.",1
1674,I thought it was a fitting full circle that leaves room for continuation. May the force with you!,1
1675,"This was very enjoyable and a very satisfying resolution to the franchise. I was not a fan of the Last Jedi at all and didn’t have huge expectations for this one but it restored my faith in Star Wars. Don’t believe all the hate, I really can’t understand it personally.",1
1676,O filme apresentou cenas meio desinteresantes e respostas que queriamosApesar de ter poucas batalhas de sabre o final apresentou uma grande batalhaE muitas referancias dos outros filmes,1
1677,"I thought the movie was good, it could’ve been better but it could’ve been a lot worse. It starts off really solid we see scenes of Kylo cutting though a group of enemies, which was quite brutal we see limbs getting cut off and a lot of it’s in slow motion which just adds so much to the scene. We also see the falcon with Poe, Fin and a few others running away from the first order having a bit of banter which was nice to see, i thought them making quick jumps to hyperspace was fun and demonstrates something we’ve been told since a new hope, that the falcon is fast which is nice to see we haven’t seen it being any faster than other ships before. The middle seemed a bit rushed to me running around like a bunch of fetch quests in a game but it didn’t ruin it for me. Palatine was great a little weak at the end but he was scary which was a fantastic change to the other ones where I saw him as quite pathetic. I didn’t mind the force powers either Rays force heal worked, it took away form some things that happen to Kylo but again it didn’t ruin it. I felt like they should’ve brought back all the former force ghost to help ray fight him instead they made them talk to her which I think was meant to be them helping her but it would’ve been nice, still gave me chills to hear Anikin, Obi wan, mace, yoda, qui gon and the rest of felt good. And we finally saw that Luke train Leia which should’ve been mentioned before. If you are going to see it ignore the reviews and go in with an open mind and remember all of starwars has cringy writing don’t focus on it take in the experience instead.",1
1678,"I loved it! Do not listen to the critics, they loved The Last Jedi so what does that tell you. The opening sequence (not shot, sequence) is my favorite opening sequence in all of Star Wars. J.J Abrams subtlety cleans up the mess Rian Johnson left us with and even repairs some of the things he did. J.J. shows us HE should have been in charge of all three movies in this franchise from the get go. The story is a fast paced action packed ride and we get the most powerful Kylo Ren we've seen, which is amazing. Rey EARNS her power through the  most difficult trials personally she's had in the franchise, which finally shows us the great character that she always was but now it let's us appreciate it and her place in the story more. GO SEE IT.",1
1679,"The movie is flawed, but it´s pure entertainment, that´s what Star Wars is all about.",1
1680,"Take two full-length movies, staple them together, and hit the fast forward button. It's the fastest-paced movie I've ever watched. It's convoluted. It's ridiculous. It's a mess. I liked it.",1
1681,"the only truly bad thing i can say about this movie is that there is a kiss so ridiculous in the final act that people in the movie theater were laughing their asses off about it. it’s absurd and has no chemistry or build up whatsoever. and it comes on the heels of a “redemption” that is never a redemption at all; just simply a switching of sides from one second to the next.however, apart from that, it’s the most star wars movie i could ask for. it has heart, it has action and fun and emotion and the good characters trying to stay good people even in the face of incredible odds. it’s such a fitting end to the saga that i left the theater more relieved than i thought was possible, with my only thought being: “ok, that’s over; now i’m ready to see other characters and stories in this universe!”.",1
1682,"See it yourself, don't jugde by reviews. I was really sceptic about it, I didn't like 7 because New Hope 2.0, I didn't like 8 because Rian Johnson. But 9...amazed me, there is a lot of adventure and emotional moments. Quality moments which importants for Star Wars fans, Star wars lore. I was ok with every plot move and decision. Walked out completely satisfyed because I have learned and seen a lot of things I wanted. Thanks J.J.",1
1683,"Don't listen to the haters, this was as good an ending to a multi-decade, 9 movie arc as could be hoped for (especially given that one of the main characters' actress, Carrie Fischer, died before filming could begin).  JJ Abrams was forced to make a couple hammered together plot points that can be chastised as silly or unreasonable, sure, but I don't see how the movie could have been done without them.  The conclusion was nonetheless very satisfying, beautifully filmed, and well worth seeing.  I can't wait to get it on iTunes and watch it again!",1
1684,"It's not easy to fix what Rian Johnson did to the series with The Last Jedi but J.J. Abrams does an amazing job to give the saga a satisfying ending for the fans and trying to give the illusion of a red thread through the last 3 movies. He fixes a lot of things that The Last Jedi did and while he could have done more he has more respect for Rian Johnson's work than Rian Johnson had for J.J. Abrams' work.If you liked The Force Awakens you will most likely like this movie too. However, if you liked The Last Jedi you probably wont like this movie.",1
1685,"Although it's undoubtedly flawed, the movie itself tries it's best to be an emotional and compelling ending to the worst of all trilogies. While it fails in most cases, in others it succeeds. And it is in these rare moments of joy, where an obvious pattern is to be seen. If only this whole trilogy was given to a single director with one coherent vision, perhaps we would have got a Star Wars movie we both craved and deserved.",1
1686,"So I didn’t like the Last Jedi, it definitely underwhelmed me and I just didn’t like what i saw.  Now with the Rise of Skywalker I had a lot of reservations going in, and I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was funny and had me on the edge of my seat, right off the bat I knew what was going on, the movie did a great job telling us what was going on, and I never got lost in the story. I even laughed a lot more than I thought. Honestly this was a great end to the saga and I look forward to seeing what the next step is. The movie isn’t perfect but everyone needs to remember right or wrong the last Jedi messed a lot of things up and this brought everything back full circle.",1
1687,"The movie was really good and super enjoyable! A good old fashioned movie and nothing stupid like a lot of the TLJ jokes. Really good cgi and sound. I'm kind of glad some of the action was abbreviated. And Palpatine wasnt as wonky as previews made it appear. Rose was cut to about 3 lines and 4 secs of the 2.5 hours. There was a girl kissing girl scene, but nothing like the Holdo agenda in the entire movie. Trust me, I hated TLJ and after reading the msg boards for a couple days, I was prepared to be let down. Finn actually had a good part and contributed. Only 1 porg. Good Job JJ. I'd give it an 8 of 10.",1
1688,It definitely fixes the flaws and mistakes that episode VIII have done and I have quite enjoyed it,1
1689,"Really don't get the hate, yes there are plot holes , yes there are things that don't make sense but that's always been the case since a new hope.The performances from the ST leads were fantastic and there are so many iconic and memorable moments in the Film. I also thought the way they dealt with Carrie Fisher was fantastic and it was a really satisfying arc for Kylo",1
1690,"If you hate the Last Jedi as much as I do, go see this movie. This was a big middle finger to Rian Johnson and his trash film that derailed the trilogy. Was SW9 a great film? No. There was some really dumb stuff in it. Was the story a hot mess? Yes, but it had to be if it was going to fix the Last Jedi and still give character arcs for everyone. Rey actually has a character arc and no longer a Mary Sue. Ghost Luke acts like a master Jedi instead of a bum. Poe is respected and has some of the funniest moments (yes, this movie actually has jokes that land), Finn is not a goofball character. Our three main heroes actually bond and you can feel their friendship. C3P0 and R2D2 are in this movie a lot, which was missing in the first two. The dumb plot points from the leaks are true, but our characters are saved. Go see this movie.",1
1691,Very strong. People have been critical but it delivered in the emotional heart of Star Wars.,1
1692,"Now to think of it, after all of its positives and negatives. J.J Abram did the best he could do for Rise of Skywalker. Last Jedi was horrible and J.J did a great Job repairing the damage. Rey is op because she has palpatine blood, and palpatine is the most powerful sith ever. Rey being palpatine and palpatine being what he is surely seen in the future star wars. Overall a good comeback. Sequels and the Original are still the best for me of course.",1
1693,"The final conclusion to the Skywalker saga. The movie was well crafted and beautifully constructed. Another masterpiece of storytelling from Director JJ Abrams. Although many are conflicted about this movie now I believe in time people will come to love this movie as much as I do. The story draws from current canon and also from the larger legends universe to nicely end this amazing movie franchise. Visually spectacular. Before judging the movie, go see it for yourself.",1
1694,"Best film from all sequels, finally they decided to do something with the Force better than only pushing things and make lightning from fingers, characters are great, story is ok, only in first 15-20min of film things happen too fast, I was touched in one scene, great movie, I love it",1
1695,"It wasnt the best Star Wars movie ever, but it isnt even remotely as bad as some people make it out to be. If your a Star Wars fan, see it in the theaters, if not, wait for the dvd.",1
1696,Great plot. Jumpy beginning. Finds pace in the second half. Overall good. This is the way.,1
1697,"This movie is Amazing! The negative reviews are just from embittered moviegoers and critics. Metacritic ranked this film the tenth out of the eleven films and yet ranked The Last Jedi  second. For me this movie did everything I wanted and then more. It’s incredible what they were able to do in terms of getting things on track after the missteps in The Last Jedi and Carrie Fisher’s death. I feel like this movie brought things full circle as much as possible and gave a ton of nods to fans. Whereas The Last Jedi was Rian Johnson’s attempt to upend what Star Wars is all about, The Rise of Skywalker tries to recapture what was in the originals and tie up the loose ends to close the saga satisfactorily.  And for me it did just that. The fact that ROS brings back the traditional tropes of the originals is why critics are giving it bad reviews. That’s why they loved TLJ so much. TLJ was Johnson’s attempt to see how much he could upend and still get away with. Doing things differently for the sake of doing things differently doesn’t make a good final product. Hence why Luke’s arc was almost ruined. There is some restoration of his journey in ROS. Anyway, just focus on enjoying the movie and stop worrying about what these bitter critics are trying to pick apart.",1
1698,"I LOVED how Kylo and Rey had this conflict going on, Rey with the dark side, Kylo with knowing what's right. The movie got a lot of backlash, but it was the character development in the movie was phenomenal!!",1
1699,"With the tumultuous backlash of The Last Jedi, JJ Abrams cranks up the pacing of this film to get the ball rolling. And it doesn't stop.Despite having issue with some creative choices, the film was very enjoyable.",1
1700,This movie is fantastic. Considering how Rian Johnson left the franchise JJ did an amazing job cleaning up his mess and giving the true fans the Star Wars we deserved. Every issue people have with this film starts with TLJ being the cause. Thank you JJ for all the little things you did in this movie to fix the series.,1
1701,"Nice film, with great performances from Ridley, Driver, Isaac and Boyega. Sadly, it lacks of many important things. And fails on understanding the universe of Star Wars. Please Anakin is the chosen one, come on, he didn't even appear.",1
1702,There were a few things I would’ve changed but that’s just based on opinions. Overall I really enjoyed watching the movie and thought it was a great edition to the trilogy and SW universe,1
1703,"It was a great movie, I honestly don’t understand the hate for it.If you are thinking about watching it but are looking at the reviews and seeing that there bad don’t listen to them in my opinion it’s a great movie",1
1704,"Unlike The Last Jedi, and to some extent, The Force Awakens, this movie will be the most re-watchable, and most analyzed over time. These are two characteristics that are essential when it comes to Star Wars. The only real flaw of the movie is that it's rushed. The story decisions, on further analysis and over time will become much more palatable to the fans when compared to the story decisions made in The Last Jedi.",1
1705,"The only thing I’ll say is many of the reviewers on here clearly have no understanding of mythological structure.  In a cycle things return full circle. And to get caught up in plot holes and logic when your watching a movie from a franchise, set in another galaxy, that has always eschewed the physics of outer space, is sort of silly. Was the movie perfect, probably not, but to say it’s the worst in the saga is major hyperbole. I mean worse than “Attack of the Clones”? Come on! That being said I’ve seen AOC like twenty times because, warts and all, it’s part of the Star Wars. Also, all of the films since the original have existed in the context of a larger universe. Books, comics, tv shows. So, if you’re having trouble following along,  perhaps your confusion says something about your personal interest in the franchise.  Anyway I give It 7 out of 10 because I found it very satisfying. Only ESB gets a 10 from me. May The Force Be With You.",1
1706,Great conclusion to this trilogy. JJ Abrams did the best with what he had under his hand. Exploring mythology not yet seen in a SW movie,1
1707,Loved it.Very well done. I don't understand the negative reviews. I am glad I chose to see it,1
1708,"Really not sure why any star wars fan wouldn't enjoy this film, its action packed, fun, emotional and a good finale to the story. My wife, my two young children and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and look forward to watching it many times again,  well done JJ and George, 40 years in the making",1
1709,Much better than ratings suggest. Everyone expects too much because it is Star Wars. If you really look at it and rate it as you would any other movie it is great!!,1
1710,"I think the film is definitely better than ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The last Jedi"".",1
1711,"I really enjoyed this movie,  The director did a good job of saving the trilogy. Some of the elements felt thrown in out of the blue but I think it was needed.",1
1712,"After seeing this movie 7 times, I can say it's the best movie I've ever seen and I've been a Star Wars fan since the 70s.  But if you aren't a fan that knows the story well, most of this movie will go right over your head. The critics are clueless.",1
1713,One of the best movies I have ever watched I don't understand why people hate itBut I don't mind lising to them and hope disany dose the same keep up the good work,1
1714,Thought it was exciting and entertaining great job by JJ Abrams. It really hit all the marks,1
1715,"An incredible achievement. Abrams, Terrio, and the whole team had an almost impossible task here but they miraculously delivered. Contrary to what I'm seeing from many people in the film critic world and a small minority of fans, I thought that this movie was very much inspired and ambitious, taking many risks that could have easily fallen flat but instead somehow worked beautifully. Moreover, the love and care that went into crafting it shines through in just about every single scene; the resulting experience is pure delight soaring through a deluge of tears.I was blown away by how much of Leia we saw, and how well they pulled it off; I was expecting for her role in this chapter to rely way more on indirect references and inferences, but instead she was right there. Sure, knowing that it was built upon footage that was taken in an entirely different context makes it hard to squint enough to completely blur the seams, but more than anything else, I was deeply touched by how beautifully her scenes and arc were woven into the overall story. I don't think I've ever cried so much during a movie!Leia's incorporation wasn't the only miraculous element of this movie; it was really the overall story and how strongly it brought the whole saga together like a jigsaw puzzle. So many questions answered while staying true to Star Wars as a modern mythology filled with powerful archetypes (and mysteries), and it never felt cheap or overwrought to me. I think it actually made The Last Jedi (which I also liked a lot, just in case you feel tempted to write me off as another Rian Johnson hater) better; there were multiple elements in that film that I struggled to make sense of, but this one somehow managed to pull many of them into the fold in a fascinating and seamless way. It didn't undo or diminish anything from ""Last;"" it only built upon and enriched that chapter's plot and themes.More miracles: The performances in this film, especially by Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver, were the best acting I've ever seen in a Star Wars movie. There really wasn't a weak link anywhere. John Boyega was the best he's been in this trilogy, Oscar Isaac was great as always, I absolutely adored Keri Russell as Zorri Bliss and Naomi Ackie as Jannah, and the returning cast from the original trilogy were (seemingly) effortlessly perfect (I loved how big of a role 3PO had!). The chemistry between everybody was totally natural and at times electric; really all you could ask for. Oh, and Babu Frik and D-0! So good!All of this came together to give us a movie with a ton of heart and soul, lots of shocking surprises, a powerful message of hope and love, loads of thrilling action with my favorite lightsaber duels ever, and just the right amount of humor that managed to be fresh and playful while still having that classic Star Wars feel. And it was just plain fun! Remember fun? And finally, it had MAGIC. This will probably enrage ""Rise"" haters to no end as the ultimate sacrilege, but I honestly haven't felt such a sense of magic in a Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back's Yoda and X-Wing scene on Dagobah impossibly combined a small green hand puppet, Miss Piggy's and Cookie Monster's puppeteer and voice actor, a fog-machined studio swamp set, a model spaceship, and John Williams' score into something miraculously sublime. Perhaps we can thank Carrie Fisher's spirit for intervening with a little touch of Force magic in this one.Just one more thought, and for some this will probably be the most polarizing: I couldn't help but notice how powerfully this final chapter of the saga lifted up a number of simple but deeply universal messages just as the strongest of the previous episodes have, and in this case they were quite relevant to the dark times we currently find ourselves in. I especially loved Zorri's ""They win by making you think you’re alone"" and ""There's more of us"" while stormtroopers moved throughout the village separating children from their families. So very, very applicable to the nightmare we're going through in the US (and many other parts of the world) right now. (Sorry Trump fans, I don't know how to put it more gently. Star Wars has always been a cry of protest against a very real dark side, whose traits -- anger, hatred, cruelty, greed, narcissism, deceit, impulsiveness, impatience, authoritarianism, autocracy -- are so thoroughly personified by the current resident of the White House and his GOP sycophants that this episode can't help but have an overtly politically message if it wants to stay true to the values that have undergirded Star Wars from the beginning.) The scenes of community and diversity, fueled by love and hope, among members of the Resistance shine as an alternative vision for us to strive towards. And for those of us with loved ones who have fallen prey to these dark, tribalistic impulses, this movie also offers a powerful reminder to not lose hope in them. May the Force be with us all.",1
1716,"I have been a star wars fan since I was 5 I'm 19 now. What an emotional journey this film was and is. If you don't like the last Jedi because of its flaws this fixes a lot if not all of them. It fixes the Rey character for me as well. If you are a fan give it a shot. The film isn't perfect obviously, but obviously only one is. Empire Strikes Back and my favorite Revenge of the Sith. Rise of Skywalker is actually my 3rd favorite star wars movie and my favorite of the sequel trilogy for sure.",1
1717,"I'm going to give it an 9.  From an entertaining aspect, that's where it belongs.  It's action pack, a lot of cinematography, and great star wars lore.From a hardcore star wars fan, it clearly missed the shot with many people. Aiming to please more than just your average viewer.  From the awkward kiss between Rey and Ren (Wow similar names) to the death of Lia, to the way they handle Luke a lot questionable decision.My biggest issue with it, is lack of originality.  I felt like this whole trilogy, was more of a remake of episode 4,5,6.It's a story about a protagonist journey to bring balance to the force  (Luke = Rey).  A message was given by a leader (Obi Wan + R2D2 = Lia + BB), and a villain, with family ties, trying to stop them (Darth Vader + Luke = Palatine + Rey)    I felt like they were writers/director was too scared to develop their own story.  P.S. I wasn't quite sure why everyone had to die either..",1
1718,Best film since the original trilogy. Ties everything together for a definitive end of the story.,1
1719,"I loved this movie. Easily the best of the 3 in the new trilogy and better than all the prequels. After investing over 40 years into this series I truly don't think Abrams could have stuck this landing much better. The bad reviews seems to complain about ""to much fan service"".  Translation:  he did too much to make people who love star wars love the movie instead of catering to film critics. And they say he made no brave choices?  That was his brave choice.  Risk bad reviews and make a Star Wars movie for people who love Star Wars - not for the people with film degrees.  I love art films as well but this is ending Star Wars and I wanted this movie.  Thanks JJ.",1
1720,Loved rise of the skywalker. Amazing ending to the saga. Need to see it again.,1
1721,"What do you wish for? A movie about space samurai wielding laser swords who occasionally lift things and use mind control to be fluid and clear? A movie based on a trilogy, based around 8 other direct tie ins to stand on it's own? This movie is not any of those, it will never be everything you want a hundred million dollar movie franchise to be. Do you wish to ignore the horrible decaying world around you for a couple hours and change? Want to chuckle, be enthused, depressed, and maybe even cry? Then give this movie a chance. The people who have already decided their opinion on this movie will not be moved, nore will I even try to push them. This is Star Wars, enjoy the ride, or hate the bumps in the rollercoaster.",1
1722,"The movie is just perfect at delivering answers and an outstanding end to the beloved saga.Although it's not flawless, it has that many beauties that blinds you to it's flaws and wouldn't let you go out of the theater with out a proud-smily face.",1
1723,Le film est dynamique et très dense en action. Alors oui certains éléments ne plairont pas à tout le monde. Cependant cet épisode sauve un peu la baraque.,1
1724,"JJ Abrams did a great job here, after the train wreck that was the Last Jedi. The media has decided to hate this movie unfairly, not unlike what they did with Joker. But the entire audience clapped at the end. I thought it was a great way to wrap up the series. Adam Driver was amazing.",1
1725,"I liked it. Fast paced, great visuals and so much better than horrific episode 8. Thank you JJA for quite good solution to this mess. I love the casting - Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo are perfect in this episode. They deserved better story",1
1726,"Best movie of the three. I wasnt a big fan of the 1st one, was mixed on the 2nd, but this one delivers. Non stop action, has all the characters, ties all the story lines from the original three, keeps you on your seat, and has a climactic ending. I'm thinking some of these guys giving bad reviews were going to give this one a zero no matter what.  There is no pleasing them. I myself have been a Star Wars fan for 40 years. I saw A New Hope in the theater a gazillion times as a kid.  So as an old school Star Wars fan, I can say this one hit the mark and was a fitting finale to the Saga.",1
1727,"I personally love the film, I think it ended perfectlyThe only thing I wish they added was the force ghosts of anakin, Obi-Wan,Yoda, and explain why Rey has a yellow lightsaber",1
1728,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was unfortunately not given much to go off of from Rian Johnson's mess that was 'The Last Jedi'. This film takes the mess left behind and executes some stupid and silly ideas very well. This film was enjoyable, the action scenes were very much impactful and a joy to watch. The acting is exceptional and runs alongside amazing directing by JJ Abrams who does a very good job to make it feel like a 'Star Wars' film. That being said, the film was relatively convoluted but it was not extremely hard to keep up with the plot, there is just a lot to take in here. Overall, 'The Rise of Skywalker' is unpredictable in good ways, takes risks that work out pretty well, but with that comes a bit of a mess that unfortunately can make someone lose their focus with the screenplay. People are going to say it just sucks and it ""the worst star wars film,"" but that is not true at all. Just try to enjoy it, it is not spectacular or by any means the best 'Star Wars' film, but it is really good and worthy of having the name ""Skywalker"" in its title, and a good amount of that is derived from that terrific ending. Score: 7.8/10",1
1729,"Purely loved it! Wonderful film and a great way to finish this saga...Don't really understand all the anger, I enjoyed and will keep watching this beautiful film again and again!",1
1730,Best of the sequel trilogy. Great conclusion. Lots of action. Lots of emotions. Best lightsaber battle of the saga. Amazing space battles. The cast is wonderful.,1
1731,"Great movie, somehow resolves all the dangling threads in a very enjoyable (albeit incredibly fast-paced/dense) movie. Not sure what the trolls are on about, this was clearly a movie for the fans and a labor of love, but clearly a big portion of the internet is still too butthurt about Last Jedi to just enjoy it. Highly recommend.",1
1732,"So my girlfriend believes my numeric review of a 7 is too generous.  However, my own justifications are explained further.  I can understand the fact that a lot of unresolved plot points had to be quickly exposed.  I had a bad feeling about midcourse correcting the film's directorship from Colin Trevorrow to J.J. Abrams, who, let's face it, has very few thought-provoking or original ideas of his own.  So much of what was developed in 'The Last Jedi' gets jettisoned within the first 10-15 minutes of this installment of the Skywalker saga.In this go-round Abrams plays it safe to the point of feeling disingenuously contrived and rushed, leading to essentially Return of the Jedi 2.0.  The movie clocks in at close to two-and-a-half hours, when it could have been slightly longer, and might have felt more complete.  For a true die-hard Star Wars fan like myself, I find it difficult to bear the fact that Rey's parentage is explained in near split-second flashbacks.  Why the film did not explain further how her parents could have evaded Sheev Palpatine (their own father) for close to ten years further adds insult to injury.  Thanks to fanboys shaming Kelly Marie Tran for her bubbly portrayal of Rose Tico in 'The Last Jedi', she gets placed on the back-burner in this one.  Lando Calirissian gets no more than a few snapshots worth of screen time. The fact that Ben Solo dies saving Rey further closes the gap for any possibility of passing on the Skywalker lineage, even though Rey says at the end that she is Rey Skywalker.  The only possibility of saving some of these plot points is if a novelization, a non-EA video game, or Special Edition of the film fills in the gaps.With all of that being said, the movie is worth watching at least once, perhaps twice in theaters, if for no other reason than to be able to see it in Digital, as well as, in 3D.",1
1733,"Very great movie.  I've watched the star wars saga my entire life and have delved into the lore as well.  This movie does a great job of tying episode 7 into 9, and also explaining potholes developed in episode 8.",1
1734,"Did people watch the same movie? The effects are amazing, the story caps off wonderfully, and while the pacing may suffer a little, in reality, this was a fantastic star wars film that gave me all the feels a star wars film should.",1
1735,Excellent    the best of the new trilogy.   Wraps everything up well...a couple of awkward moments.   The end of the Skywalker Saga..  or is it?,1
1736,"I don’t think this movie is perfect, in fact I don’t really like the beginning. But,I think it was a great end to the saga and think it deserves above a 50.",1
1737,"Reviewers are babies. JJ just had to do a ton of damage control from the mess Rian left him. It was a great movie, best of the 3.",1
1738,"I really enjoyed it. Yes it has flaws, but it's my favorite of the sequel trilogy and nowhere near as bad as some critics and bitter ""fans"" would have you believe. A fair portion of the movie was somewhat predictable but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I recommend seeing it for yourself with an open mind.",1
1739,"Much like the last two movies, there's no way this movie could please everyone. There's no way it could live up to expectations. But I still enjoyed it. My only real critique is that they cared more about fan service than story, but the story provided was entertaining. The acting was top notch, the theme felt like A New Hope, and the ending was pure emotion. It's definitely not a movie for everyone. It's definitely not deep. But it's still a great movie and we'll worth a watch.",1
1740,"Thought it was great. I think they were all pretty good, the first was the weakest for me but overall it ended well.. A lot like the last trilogy.",1
1741,I love the movie The movie have good ending for 9 movies  Ray and ben vs palpatin was incredible Palpatine was very powerful but Luke was with ray,1
1742,"¡Increíble! Coge algunas de las mejores cosas de las viejas películas, coge algunas de las mejores cosas de las nuevas, y hace un mix excepcional en el que más de 2 horas de película se pasan volando. ¿Tiene mucho fanservice? por supuesto, pero ¿en qué cabeza cabe que un fan se queje del fanservice? Es una película hecha de un gran fan, para fans, y tiene momentos realmente épicos y emotivos.Alucinante.",1
1743,"Let me start by saying the following, I have lost all hope in star wars from Disney but this this movie saves it all.Don't listen to low rating reviews this movie is amazing in every possible way. yes, it's lacking the SW 1-2-3 saber fights but the lightsaber fights always were a path to explain something else. basically this movie finishes off most if not all loose ends. and I think gives the ending that the characters of the SW universe deserve. a huge amount of action, tears will be shed, all in all, amazing movie.",1
1744,Great movie for fans of the series. It's a bit of a mess structurally but it's the character moments and well done fan service that elevates this movie to something special.,1
1745,"The critics are wrong, non stop action, a must see. A great conclusion to the Skywalker saga. So much to take in and enjoy.",1
1746,"The critics got this one way wrong, The Rise of Skywalker is absolutely a satisfying end to the Skywalker Saga! It is the best movie in the Sequel Trilogy. I came into this movie with somewhat lowered expectations due to the Last Jedi, but I was pleasantly surprised! The action and fight scenes are well done and fleshed out, and the movie’s plot didn’t feel as rushed as I originally thought it would be. It redeemed what the Last Jedi tried to destroy. Overall, I’d give this a 8/10 but I’m giving it a 10/10 to negate some of the idiots who are giving it a 0/10.",1
1747,"I came only from the cinema from the night session, the film is very good Star Wars magic is there and the chemistry between the characters is simple cool there are still a lot of very good moments that will give you goosebumps and peace if you are a real fan of star wars then the film will come to you and by the way I am a real fan of stars and me I liked the movie, I don’t understand the people who are supposedly fans, but they didn’t like the movie, what kind of fans are they?And as for the critics, you really can’t read them, it's like the story of a blade runner who understood.Thanks",1
1748,"Es una buena ejecución para una trilogía algo dañada por las decisiones que se tomaron, personalmente me encantó esta cinta, y fue un buen adiós para la saga de los Skywalker y al mismo tiempo abre el camino para más proyectos, esta pelicula juega con la nostalgia de los fans de las precuelas como de la TO junto al hecho de que es una pelicula entretenida y lo que diga la critica me chupa un huevo, a mi me me gustó .",1
1749,"For what we were left with after 8, I felt that this was great closure and a movie truly made for Star Wars fans.",1
1750,"While not the better SW movie so far, it’s clearly a good conclusion for Disney Star Wars trilogy which has been badly conducted and directed from the very start. Packed with action and emotion, main characters are now bold enough to take space on screen, secondary ones aren’t very present, it’s visually impressive, musically deceptive. A good movie in a bad trilogy. Better movie than the prelogy anyway. Go see it, then we can turn the page and go along with the Mandalorian and other equivalent stuff! ;)",1
1751,"It certainly is not perfect, however given the absolute mess that JJ and co were left with after The Last Jedi, they have done a brilliant job and closed off the Skywalker saga in a fun and satisfying way. It made me feel like a kid again which is exactly what I want from a Star Wars movie. I don't understand why people aren't liking it? Maybe they have poor taste?",1
1752,"The first half is muddled but once it gets going I really enjoyed it. I think after the last one which pushed very little forward and chopped off so many plot points it was a hard film to make, but I enjoyed it!",1
1753,If I were to honestly rate this movie i would give it a 76%. I think the hate is over the top with critics everywhere saying it is the worst star wars movie yet. Remember those critics also saying the last jedi is one of the best. I think in general most audience members enjoyed the movie with some good moments where the audience actually laughed. The story is messy and it isn’t the best star wars movie but it is a good one nonetheless! If you’re not sure to go and see the movie i would give it a shot but expect it to be messy in the beginnig.,1
1754,"Abrams and Terrio deserve nothing but praise after taking what the TLJ did and gluing it together into a consistent ending without actually disregarding Rian Johnson's story. While the overall saga resents from the clear lack of a well thought out and unified plot for all 3 movies this installment stands out as the best of the new trilogy. This is the movie that current generations will praise further down the line. It's vibrant and despite moving sometimes too fast for someone not so young it flows nicely and keeps you trapped in the adventure. Fans will complain again because it certainly does not follow the principles set by the original trilogy, this is what happen with TLJ too and while I certainly dissagree on some things from that movie and I do not fully embrace the ""Let the past die"", you certainly will have more fun watching this movie if you stop holding on! and let go!",1
1755,"It’s a great star wars movie, not without flaws. It goes too fast at the beginning I hope we’ll get a longer version when it comes out in blu ray. I really like the ending given to the saga. Don’t listen to the haters or soncalled « fans » , I’m a fan too and I loved it!",1
1756,"I went to see it this evening and I thought it was insane, the story line was perfect and I thought Avengers Endgame was going to be my personal best movie for the year, but I have to say Star Wars was incredible well done to there whole cast :).",1
1757,"I enjoyed this movie and I will see this movie again in IMAX. Tops TFA for me, wonderful job JJ and crew. Though I do say I hope to see more star wars movies.......with a little more continuity if we are doing a trilogy",1
1758,"Full of surprises, fixed The Last Jedi and gave us a good trilogy ending. I was without expectations and left the movie theater almost in tears. It was good to see Carrie Fisher one last time.",1
1759,"The best from latest trilogy, fixes all the mess TLJ was. A bit rushed and overstuffed because of fixing previous installment, this movie improves ep7 and fixes 8 making the whole trilogy to look better. At least, JJ had a plan.",1
1760,"Best movie in the latest trilogy. It had to spend a majority of the screen time fixing the absolute garbage the Last Jedi was. It was a solid Star Wars film - You'll notice a lot of low scores are because ""it's like they just checked boxes in what fans wanted"" lol As if that's a bad thing. Go watch it. :)",1
1761,"I think this was the best movie in this trilogy. It's much better than the critics are saying.  If you like Star Wars, I highly recommend seeing it",1
1762,"It is a good movie, it is not perfect, but it is full of pleasant surprises, and although it is not the best ending, it is a worthy ending considering the mistakes of the other director, you can enjoy it quietly, may the force be with you.",1
1763,"Out of what it had to work with after TLJ, I think it’s a 10/10 but it was 2 movies in one.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Good fun, like Star Wars is supposed to be.Once the Disney haters relax, we’ll see the real reviews show this was actually good, albeit a space fantasy that is supposed to bend the rules.  They don’t run out of fuel in this one, for example...If you didn’t like episode 8, you’ll like this one, and visa versa.",1
1764,This was the best Star Wars movie I have ever seen. It hits all the points. Minus one point for some shaky acting and a handful of mixed up plot points. Otherwise I highly recommend this conclusion to one of the greatest cinema sagas ever.,1
1765,"Not the greatest but certainly worth going to see. O had a few problems, with it, never explaining anything with Palpatine, just there in the begining and no explanation of it. The whole world he was on was, they had 8 movies previous and no mention of it, then it felt like GOT with the whole thrown thing....that said, it was still a really good star wars movie that's worth watching.",1
1766,"Everything I liked in this movie, I really liked, and everything I didn’t, really hurt the film for me. The film is the fun action space adventure I wanted after my slightly above mediocre reaction to The Last Jedi, and that’s what I got. However, some things in this film just feel too cultured, or too convenient as plot points, or instances where something magically works but shouldn’t, these moments just didn’t work for me. And honestly a lot of of the first half of the film could have been removed and used to further develop character or build relationships that were never really touched on in the previous two films. Although I enjoyed the movie, it just shows how this trilogy had no preconceived plan and that The Last Jedi essentially ended every plot line that was supposed to be carried on from The Force Awakens.",1
1767,Second best Disney Star Wars Film after Rogue One and better than The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi in my opinion.,1
1768,"There so much they had to pack into this film that it feels a bit rushed, but overall I really enjoyed it. I think it's a great ending.",1
1769,"It’s clear that this movie should have been broken into two films so that it can properly build up the characters and the stakes but this is the problem with what TLJ did, it left a hole in the middle trilogy for the final film to pick up on. This film has a lot of plot with not much room to breath and it makes sense, if JJ had done episode 8 then his trilogy would have been far more consistent. But I still think what JJ did with the concepts and lore expansion for this film is great compared to TLJ which did not much at all for Star Wars, I feel that if episode 8 were the first half of is movie it would have been much better received, the whole trilogy really.",1
1770,"I loved it.  Lots of Action, lots of nostalgia, a great balance in the story, zero predictable, good jokes, 10 out of ten from me a 32 years old casual fan that have seen all the movies and haven’t really enjoyed too much episode 7 and 8.",1
1771,Honestly would have given an 8 but many people here giving the movie a 0 or 1 are not fair to the film at all. More time with Lando would have been great but overall it was a good ending.,1
1772,"Hardly a great movie, but great fun and far better than the disaster of TLJ.",1
1773,Going right up there with Empire and A New Hope as one of my favourites. Answered everything from Last Jedi and surpassed expectations.,1
1774,"Just sit back and enjoy the ride. It may not take you where you think you want to go, but in the end, both the ride and final destination are a fabulous finale.",1
1775,"I been a star wars fan since I was 2 years old this movie was, Well done and the last Jedi was a fan film that divided us all. We can't blame Disney for making a good end to the triolgy. I don't care the isults I am going to recive. I am a hardhard core star was fan this film was amazing. You say what you want but it was the best of the trilogy and it will be talked about for decades too come. I am also looking forward too the new old Republic series that should  be better than the prequels it may have revan as the main character.",1
1776,the movie was a lot to take in but that doesn’t mean it was bad. for such a big saga the ending was quite fitting. it left some lose ends but thats a good thing because its a fun thing for the audience to end the story for themselves. i highly recommend to go see it.,1
1777,This is the best Star Wars movie ever!!! This is the ending we all deserved,1
1778,"J. J. Abrams does an excellent job in edit and direction for this film. The acting and pacing of the film is great. Story is great. Secondary characters and sub plots are done respectively.  New images, creatures and devices are presented.  If you are concerned about critics, the critics are basically making the routine criticisms of any sequels, which is quite silly when you know it is a sequel.",1
1779,"Way better than expected, fixed a lot of the problems I had with The Last Jedi.",1
1780,"This is a good movie and I don't understand all the hate. However, what this movie fails to do is surprise, which happened in The Last Jedi, Empire Strikes Back, and Revenge of the Sith. I give it a solid 9 out of 10. It is an overall decent movie here, it just missed the surprised part.",1
1781,"While this movie probably only deserves an 8 (that's my personal opinion, although I admit objectively it should be only around a 7), I feel like a lot of people aren't giving this movie a chance and aren't really thinking for themselves. I think the nostalgia and hype that surrounded new Star Wars movies has also fully worn off and I think this movie will age much better than the Force Awakens and the Last Jedi. Really, this was actually the most enjoyable of the sequel trilogy, in my opinion, and overall felt like the most authentic Star Wars movie since Episode 3 or Rogue One (I haven't seen Solo though). Yes, it still had moments that felt weird and honestly shouldn't be in the movie like the Last Jedi, but there weren't nearly as many as in the previous movie and they weren't always consistently awful (and some even had redeeming parts). Furthermore, it was the most original and enthralling story of the sequels and had some really great moments as well (unlike the tedious and subpar Force Awakens).",1
1782,"I loved this movie, and I've been with Star Wars my whole life. I loved The Force Awakens but was deeply turned off by The Last Jedi. This might just be my favourite Star Wars movie of them all.",1
1783,"The movie is excellent. We present a great story of the Star Wars universe, surpassing its predecessors. The action and thriller scenes made me and the people in the movie room thrill, especially with a breathtaking ending. But there are still scenes in this movie that Dysney should work a little better.",1
1784,"The strenght of the movie clearly is the emotional journey that spreads all along this intense & spectacular adventure of epic proportions. It takes place 3 years after the events of ""The Last Jedi"", thereby all our main protagonists have evolved and now all have to deal with the return of a familiar face : Palpatine.The struggle between the light & the darkness has never been so vivid. Our bloodline can or can not define who we are, because at the end of the day it always comes to our own choices anyway. And it's never too late to change the course of events ; as long as there is life, there still can be hope.Keeping alive a strong belief into this hope : that is a central theme of the entire movie. The love, the empathy, and the will to work together for a greater purpose.Another aspect that is immense and the heartbeat of this final episode, is the deep link between Rey & Kylo/Ben... With the influence of past mentors & parents to bend the destiny in a precise direction. And despite the doubts that litter the story and the destinies of our protagonists, all these connections make this film a wonderful ode to symbiosis/working together for a common benefit. Which always is the key to the development of life itself. And it very much is what the force is meant to be. Because without life : it's nothingness.The new additions (characters), plot twists, and even the cameos, all play an important part in the progression up until final chapters of the movie ; the ""grand finale"". And having Ben back to life, thanks to Leia's sacrifice (the life of a bright soul in exchange for another soul to be redeemed), in addition with Han's heartwarming words... Luke giving Rey a nice push, with light side teachings that are as well heartwarming.Rey facing her dark destiny, but by always staying faithful to what she believes in. And Ben finally back to light in a most epic way. Those are emotional bits that can give you so many chills... The gorgeous space battle brings a grandiose epicness to these last scenes, with all these ships and people unifying for a common goal. All of this in the name of the peace for the galaxy as a whole.How not to talk about all the Jedi in Rey !... Giving her the only thing that is powerful enough to erase the Sith once and for all, which is : the unity. Which is something that the Sith are incapable of doing. The rule of two is the result of the selfishness that is an inherent trait of what being a Sith is. Each Sith wants the unlimited power, and he wants it all for himself. While the Jedi always consider the benefit common to all... And having Rey, who is a Palpatine by blood, but a Skywalker by heart (as referred at the very end of the movie, btw), being the tip of the ""lightsaber"" ; it is quite simply a moment of relief.Ben's death divides the audience, but he found his redemption (after all the horrors he has commited) by giving his life in exchange for Rey's, who unlike him has not fallen to the dark side. Yes, Ben would probably have deserved a funeral and/or a force ghost... I can agree with that, but I don't fall into the hatred bandwagon because of things that I consider as details. Don't get me wrong, I would love to see new/future editions of the movie, including such things. But I also would be fine if it stays this way. Why ?... Because Ben has played his role in all of this, in the best possible way ; and to me that's what matters the most. Plus we have Rey coming back to Tatooine, right in the Lars homestad (which is a truly peaceful moment to witness)... Paying hommage to Leia & Luke, and marking this new era of peace by leaving their two lightsabers at rest. What a soothing symbol it is.The last scene satisfied me even more, with Rey now having a last name that defines who she truly is... Which is the disciple and in a sense the spiritual daughter of both Leia & Luke, but also the lover of Ben Solo/Skywalker who gave her a new life (resurrection/rebith). And what a sweet feeling to see this yellow lightsaber which evokes the Jedi Temple Guards, because in a way, Rey now is imbued with the role of Guardian of the Force itself...How satisfying and soothing all this movie was to me. All these deep & intense emotions... But also lots of memorable scenes of a visual standpoint ! With new planets, locations & settings...or revisiting places like the Death Star we know so well, but now in ruins... The lightsaber fights were imbued with these emotional vibes that can be felt all along the movie, and looked really cool (I mean, it's Star Wars) ! Also, Finn & Poe of course, but also Chewbacca & C3-PO : the secondary characters all have a moment to shine and play a pivotal role for the greater story. I don't forget Leia and the wonderful way they smoothly integrated Carrie Fisher in this movie, building scenes around her performances. Lando & Palpatine coming back, were a great fun, and hearing all the past Jedi voices was a magical feeling...",1
1785,"I was not expecting anything from this movie after really disliking The Last Jedi. 20 minutes in and I was really enjoying it but scared it would take a turn for the worse. It never did for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it and was satisfied with the ending. If anything it's made me hate The Last Jedi less. JJ really did a great job with this finally ",1
1786,"As a watcher of Starwars for many years I thoroughly enjoyed this ending to the skywalker saga. It's not perfect, but one can find fault with any of the Star Wars movies. A very moving end to this tale.",1
1787,"a near perfect finale for the skywalker sagagreat in everything, plenty of action, makes sense and delivers",1
1788,This is a good movie and a good ending to the Skywalker saga. I didn’t mind Rey calling herself a Skywalker even tho a lot of people didn’t like it.,1
1789,Great film Great story would have loved a greater space battle well done Disney.  Rey is my hero now ,1
1790,This hands dow was one of the best movies to end the Skywalker saga. Me and my family really enjoyed it and it was a great way to end it out!,1
1791,"I loved the rise of Skywalker, even with all of its flaws. Way better than the last Jedi. WAY better. Made me feel something I felt only in the original trilogy.",1
1792,"JJ Abrams is a SAVIOR. After the HORRIFIC episode 8, I thought their was nowhere to go. JJ tapped into the novels and pulled the figurative ""rabbit out of the hat."" (i.e., Timothy Zahn Novels).I went in wanting to hate this movie. Within the first 10 minutes, I was curious. Within the first hour, I was hooked. Great Job.",1
1793,"JJ Abrams redeemed the Star Wars story as best he could. Johnson had taken it in a meaningless direction which departed wildly from the heart and soul of Star Wars. When you watch a Star Wars film, you are looking for a mythical story, not a modern cautionary tale. This is why Johnson's take on Star Wars made no sense. He departed from expectations in a way that did no service to the story. Abrams did his best to reset the course. The film does feel rushed in some ways, because Abrams sadly wasn't able to lay the groundwork for his big reveals in the second installment. A key reveal regarding Rey's parentage was not explained with as much detail as it warranted. However, nonetheless, this film had heart and magic. It depicts Rey's inner turmoil beautifully, and Ben Solo's complexity is depicted masterfully as well. The supposed critic consensus on this movie is baffling. I'm not quite sure what movie they think they are evaluating. This is supposed to be Star Wars, a story that is ultimately classic in form at its heart. And that is precisely what Abrams has accomplished.",1
1794,He's not as bad as everyone says!I liked him and I think he concludes the trilogy well. The script is the weak point of the film but it's still acceptable and everything else is worthwhile.,1
1795,"This movie has it's fair share of issues, but overall it's a great end to the saga.",1
1796,I'm so glad JJ was able to salvage this trilogy after ryan johnson did his best to ruin it. I loved this movie and thought it really wrapped this story up nicely.,1
1797,"A herculean achievement. JJ Abrams brings the true Star Wars spirit back to the franchise with a story that builds on the entire history of Star Wars, course corrects the missteps of TLJ, and gives Adam Driver his best turn as Kylo Ren, all of it sprinkled with surprises and delivered with unrelenting action. The perfect conclusion to the Skywalker saga.So why the haters? Maybe the pacing was a bit unrelenting. OK sure, but so what. A lot better than it being dull and slow. People don't like Palpitane's return. But we all knew that going in. True, there is not a detailed explanation as to how he survived, but he's hooked up to a million machines so it's pretty clear he was salvaged by someone in a way similar to the way Vader was salvaged in Episode III. There is only so much time in the film. We can see more about that in a DVD special features or in the novelization. Finally, people complain about Palpitane's power at the finale. There is a very specific reason he was able to do that at that moment, but apparently the haters were not paying attention.",1
1798,"Achei que o JJ Abrams fez tudo que pôde pra consertar os erros do Episódio 8. Eu não queria dirigir um filme desse calibre, você tem que se preocupar em acalmar fãs que acham a trilogia inteira ruim (e que levam star wars como filosofia de vida e agridem quem achou a trilogia nova boa), você tem que se preocupar em não destruir a infantil mente das crianças (e, por tanto, não pode criar plots do calibre de um Game of Thrones da vida), e também precisa acabar não só uma trilogia, como também uma história que já tem 8 filmes e inúmeras HQs de background. Vejo esse filme como um ótimo tributo à saga, apesar dos pesares!",1
1799,Don't know why everyone is hating. I thought it was great. Rey being a palpatine was predictable yet it was something I wanted to happen anyway. It felt like Abrams had to clean up the mess left by Rian for the first 30-45 mins but it leveled out into a great ending for the saga.,1
1800,"It's surprisedly entertaining when you're wasted as hell and, the action scenes are up to your imagination.",1
1801,"Sensacional, salí más que contento del cine, se convirtió en mi segunda película favorita de toda la saga!",1
1802,"I would highly suggest avoiding 1/10's or 10/10'sThis is a solid movie and its really enjoyable to watch and have a fun time laughing. It's very condensed, spending a lot of its time wrapping up the saga, and the pacing feels off because of it. But the humor is solid most of the time and you will enjoy every minute of the film.",1
1803,"Справедливый фильм,который не нравится тем кто придумал себе другой",1
1804,"Great movie, hard to bring an epic to an end. No matter what JJ would´ve done, the buRRhurt would´ve hated it. Let go of your feelings and expectations and just enjoy it as a movie, like when you where a kid. Most of he tidbits you only get when you really know Star Wars. My daughter (10) loved it and wants to see it again.",1
1805,Honestly as a Star Wars fan this nailed it the way J.J. brought back iconic characters is what you wanna see. The fight scene on the old Death Star was fantastic plus more near the end,1
1806,"Some or gonna love it, some may hate it. However, please don’t go in thinking that it is going to be awful because of Last Jedi or that it completely ignores it. It acknowledges what occurred in that movie yet concludes beautifully and with a lot of references to the past!",1
1807,"Hard to say anything... Many episode, many experience. I watch the first SW in VHS, and now the Skywalker Saga finally ends. The E9 have few problem, and some good things, but this is an correct ending i thing. Not the best, but correct.",1
1808,"This movie was everything it needed to be. Nothing more, nothing less. I wanted to give it a 5 but being star wars gives it a +2 to begin with",1
1809,Very good. I'm a big fan of J. J Abrams. I hope that it Will not be the Last movie about this period,1
1810,"JJ Abrams did his best to veer this sunking ship of a trilogy  back into the light, but was unfortunately too late. The movie is bad because of The Last Jedi, completely trashed 6 movies worth of Star Wars lore. It has some good moments, but as I watched,  Han Solo's line 'That's not how The Force works!...' kept ringing in my head. I also can't stand the new heroes compared to the classic ones... they just don't work for me. I am still giving this a good rating for JJ Abrams respect for Star Wars and his attempt to make this movie feel like one set in universe we know and love. I wish Rian Johnson had never been given the chance to mess Star Wars.",1
1811,"I see where people would not like the incredibly fast pace (or the fact that the fricking emperor is alive) but I feel like it had to be this fast paced to make up for the previous two movies’ lack of story. It feels like 3 movies stuck together, and like something epic is constantly happening. It seems to be a polarizing movie, but as someone who has been a massive Star Wars fan for my entire life it was probably one of my favorites.",1
1812,It was perfect it fixed the last jedi which is exactly what starwars needs.,1
1813,"A more than fitting end to the Skywalker Saga, some how JJ Abrams has made the ultimate send off for fans no matter what side of the Last Jedi debate you sit on. A modern masterpiece!!!",1
1814,"SPOILER-FILLED REVIEW: Star Wars Episode 9 was truly amazing. Every single scene was brilliant. The plot was very straight forward and you could really feel the looming threat of the Final Order. The pacing felt very right - an Infinity War sort of conclusion to this saga. Luke felt more like Luke, of course wiser on the other side, and the Leia scenes I thought were very very well done considering how much material they had to work with. The main characters were great, to have them all together at last, and their acting was just SO GOOD compared to the last two movies. Lando’s introduction was very well done as was his performance, and he was genuinely helpful this time. The new characters were great, they didn’t feel forced-in the way that Rose felt in Episode 8, and Poe Dameron and the bounty hunter chick was great. All the C3P0 and Chewy parts felt very authentically Star Wars. This movie echos a lot of classic Star Wars themes, like some small moments like when Kylo is about to defeat Rey in the water lightsaber battle, and how no one really dies when they fall into a pit (Darth Maul, Boba Fett) While they could’ve shown how he escaped in the first scene like Gandalf fighting Balrog it’s completely fine that they didn’t. That’s what the extended universe is for. Anyone that says Rey is a Mary Sue is brainwashed by our current politics etc. There were obvious things in The Last Jedi but this film on the other hand was completely free of pushing an agenda. Why does it even matter what sex the main character is anyways? Of course she is powerful, she’s the granddaughter of Darth Sideous. It’s a challenge even for her to hold such power in the beginning, but through meditation and training she was able to stay in balance. I thought that her accidental force lightning was a great example of how much raw power inside her she’s still learning how to control. I really loved how they did the Chewy dying scene and then showed the audience right after, and also how Rey was able to sense him, it was all very well done. Anyone that says that Palpatine was added in and wasn’t the plan all along: Look at the way Rey stabs her lightsaber in Episode 7 and then watch Palpatine do it in Episode 3. It was all planned from the beginning. The Snoke clones were awesome, and the true Emperor being the puppet master throughout the entire saga was genius. Palpatine returning didn’t really diminish Darth Vader’s redemption imho, because even if he didn’t kill the emperor that day he still saved Luke from getting electrocuted to death. The space battles were good, and when the fleet of people arrived it was certainly on a much greater scale then we’ve seen before (even in the prequels) and the lightsaber battles were intense and satisfying with them using the force to block etc. They weren’t choreographed as crazy as the prequel fights but definitely were the best ones of this trilogy. As far as fan service and nostalgia goes this film certainly had less than the prior two, none of it felt corny or out of place. The force being used to heal was another great part of this movie, it was just as cool as it was in the latest episode of The Mandalorian, and the Emperor using Drain Life on Kylo Ren and Rey was fantastic, as was Kylo using the last bit of energy he had to save Rey. It all felt very much like the force was like Chi now (Chi, Ki, Prana, Life-Force Energy, whatever you wanna call it) and I thought that was pretty sick. And I personally liked Rey using the name Skywalker at the end, felt like such a blow to Emporer Palpatine, that his blood line would use the name Skywalker instead! I guess I’m the only one that thinks that. This film has much more rewatchability than the prior two, and definitely did the impossible and made the sequel trilogy feel better as a whole. The Last Jedi has some really bad parts, and also some really good parts like Rey and Kylo using that connection Palpatine made and they learned how to do it so they still could after. Btw being able to teleport objects was a really sick addition to that, I could say that’s way more like Star Wars than the Holdo maneuver lol. I’d cut out parts of Episodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 and I honestly wouldn’t cut a single part out of this movie, every scene was fantastic. The kiss was great, it was built up over a period of at least a year after they established their mind Link in the last Jedi, I thought it was fitting that they kissed because Rey loved Ben Solo and he was finally just Ben now. Palpatine using Kylo Ren to kill the heroes that defeated The Empire 40 years ago was great story-writing, and ultimately this trilogy ended up being much better than if they just turned the Thrawn trilogy into movies. 10/10 Masterpiece",1
1815,"This is an EPIC closure for the Star Wars Saga, extremely emotional and with several potent moments which ties perfectly the three trilogies of Star Wars. The cast is just perfect, with awesome action sequences and some great shots. The Rise of Skywalker when it bets, bets HIGH and at the very end it pays very well.",1
1816,"Fantastic movie, really rounded the 42 years in the making. Answered more questions then raising questions. Amazing story and great consistency throughout the whole movie. Well worth watching, definitely getting this on 4k to rewatch as many times possible. Amazing work and dedication by all that both wrote it and participated in the making of this end to the saga. A huge congratulations on this amazing movie!!",1
1817,"Thought the movie had character, good amount of comedy action, music was incredible well timed.",1
1818,"the best of the three of the new saga, very entertaining! epic battles, its a shame the last jedi exist",1
1819,"Finally a good Star Wars after Episode 8 and Solo. I did not think it was possible to be as good as it is after the last movie, but its a worthy end to the saga. It feels like a Star Wars movie, we get what we wanted. This would be even better if we had a real Episode 8.",1
1820,"I loved it, great finale. The film ties everything nicely and provides a conclusion that is very satisfying,",1
1821,"Been watching for 40 years.  This movie is cheesy, paced a little poorly, and tries to shoehorn in a lot.  It also is a blast to watch for me and the kids.  Excellent fan service.  For those who are gatekeeping so hard, try and relax.",1
1822,"If you're looking for a hardcore starwars payoff, you're not gonna get it. What you are gonna get is a 10/10 casual experience, better than Force Awakens. Not gonna lie, you're gonna wanna watch this film. Grab some friends, grab some food & a beer & get ready for a good time. Perfect for the holidays.",1
1823,"Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker is a great Star Wars movie. I really don't understand the hate aimed towards it at all. It's got great character moments, great emotion, great action, a great story, great chemistry between the cast. What more could you ask for?",1
1824,Fixes all the mistakes the last jedi made and finishes the saga beautifully.,1
1825,Full of unforeseen twists and turns.  Some surprises were satisfyingly expected.  Beautiful cinematography.  Perfect musical ensemble for being the last for John Williams.   You’re left with all questions answered at the end.  Although it leaves it open to be expanded into a variety of split stories to be told.,1
1826,"Maybe it's not the best of the nine movies (for me the fourth best), but you can enjoy it if you stop listening the haters.",1
1827,This is one of the best star wars film created. I'm sorry you hate it but others disagree.,1
1828,"I had fun, and that’s what matters. There’s a lot going on in the first hour, and the film takes a bit to settle in, but I never felt like I was bored or wanting more.",1
1829,This movie is what you call a satisfying ending to the saga and delivers on many key aspects of the film. It is the best in the trilogy and deserves recognition on how well constructed and how well JJ Abrams did o finish it like it did. Well done JJ for making a good Star Wars movie,1
1830,Excellent movie.  Don’t let the thoughts of those who only want to spread the lack of joy in their own hearts discourage you from enjoying what you want to enjoy.,1
1831,"All these comments are from twelvies who didn't grow up watching the original trilogy every Saturday morning in the 80's.Star wars is much more than plot and making sense. If you can't comprehend this then you are not a starwars fan.Star wars is more about hope and belief in good. This movie produces this spirit. Stop hating on it and the people that originally found hope from episode 4 (THE ORIGINAL)JJ Abrahms (and Disney). Thank you. I grew up with Star Wars (born the year the original was released). I spent every Saturday morning from when I can remember watching the original trilogy.This movie gave all the origianl trilogy heroes (Lea, Luke, Han, and all droids) so much of a goodbye in brilliant spirirt, as well as character development and ending arc's and stories of the new characters (and the plot) of the final trilogy. Kylo/Ben's and Reys were particularly great and engaging.This was a true starwars movie and I had to hide my tears.Starwars fan from day 1.Fight for those you love, not for hate or revenge. Learnt from Star wars. 1977 - 2019",1
1832,"Um bom filme de SW, mas que perde por ficar na zona de conforto, e não ter nem 10% da coragem que Rian Johnson teve. Agora me diz, tô falando mentira?",1
1833,A round end for the saga. I don't mind all the things that the other watcher bothers with kylo and Rey..Also some things didn't had to be.,1
1834,"I really enjoyed the movie. If you feel the same then spare yourself and stop reading negative critics!After all it's a fairytale! With princesses and monsters and swords and knights. Multiple lightspeed jumps? Sure, it's a fairytale! All of a sudden healing powers? Sure, it's a fairytale! Kissing the princess? Sure, it's a fairytale!Enjoy the esthetics! J. J. Abrams gave us beautiful pictures, once again. Rey walking underneath the Sith cube - I would put this straight on my wall! In the end the film gave me what I wanted: High polished star wars design, a few answers to open questions and a proper good bye to all my favorite characters. You might call it an overdose of fanservice - for me it's a good ending to the saga.",1
1835,Thanks JJ!!! I'm very happy with what you did! The pace and humor were spot on!! The Score and Sound effects sounded inspired unlike The Last Jedi. It may have reconned The Last Jedi(which is a good thing because that movie is 80 garbage) but last Jedi did that with Force Awakins. Rise of Skywalker focuses on Legacy characters and the 3 main new heroes which was sorely lacking In TLJ.The movie brings balance to the force of Star Wars fandom.,1
1836,"Speaking as someone who had become incredibly jaded with the Star Wars franchise, who was not excited about the Rise of Skywalker trailer, and who is sick and tired of your Baby Yoda memes, let me just say, I just saw The Rise of Skywalker, and I think it's the best Star Wars since Return of the Jedi. I'm not going to call it incredibly thought-provoking (it's not) neither will I cite its incredible insights into the human condition (there aren't many), but what it is is a rip-roaring sci-fi adventure and a sprawling space opera epic that feels more akin to 1980s George Lucas than anything I've seen since. It's almost Spielbergian.What J.J. Abrams brings to the table is an incredible love for the original trilogy and even the prequels. The movie is gushing, just bursting at the seams, with adoration and respect for this franchise. I mean, it's bursting at the seams in almost every regard—aliens, robots, explosions, ways in which one might use the force or a lightsaber. It's one of the frequent complaints critics are throwing at it. But if you sat through the last two Avengers films with no complaint, I don't think that should be an issue for the stalwart nerd. I don't think this movie erases The Last Jedi. In fact, I think it's nestled The Last Jedi a little deeper into my hard, calloused heart, as well as those awkward prequels.When The Rise of Skywalker trailer started with all those clips from episodes I-VI, I'm not gonna lie, I was annoyed. I was like, ""No, Disney, you're not going to manipulate my nostalgia and sucker me into yet another one your money-sucking mega franchise event films."" Alas, J.J. Abrams has manipulated my nostalgia, as he always does. Someway, somehow, this stupid movie has made me fall in love with Star Wars all over again. Maybe not Solo. But definitely the canonical numbered films. It's a big blustery behemoth of a love letter to Star Wars nerds everywhere.",1
1837,"Is there too much fan service? For sure. Does it 'tick all the boxes'? Yep. Does it stray too much from the comfort of what makes Star Wars Star Wars? Nope. I think it's far from perfect, but JJ Abrams did as much with the discord of the past two films (and the legacy of the previous 6) as he possibly could, and I found it to be more enjoyable than not, and that's the best that this fan of 43 years could hope for.",1
1838,"This is good movie, and one of the best trilogy endings. Don't trust haters, they will say anything to underrate sequels",1
1839,Rey has the very first cannon yellow lightsaber if you if you dont count clone wars as cannon and the scene were emporer Palpatine  force lightnings an entire fleet was by far the best in the movie.,1
1840,"Una obra maestra cinematográfica, que posee algunas fallas de lineamento temporal, algo que se debe al cambio entre director/guionista que hubo en la trilogía final. Sin embargo, Abrams logra superar el reto y entrega un final digno para los mas conocedores de la franquicia.",1
1841,It was exactly what it had to be. JJ did the best he could with the garbage he was handed by Rian Johnson. This movie was good but we will never know how good it could have been had The Last Jedi not been the worst Star Wars movie ever.,1
1842,"Una película que rescata a la saga después del desvío brutal que representó la predecesora en donde Rian Johnson perdió el norte sobre las características de personalidad de los personajes. Si bien con aprietos argumentales, puede curar y recuperar el espíritu de Star Wars lo que la hace un film excelente para los fans de hueso colorado.",1
1843,"I'm reading some reviews that say ""this is just fanservice"" and ""no plot to follow"" or ""no surprises"" BUT those are by people who did not watch the same movie I did. The one I saw had a very clear plot. If by ""fanservice"" they mean the movie wraps up and fixes what problems came before it, then yes I am glad it did so. When I hear there were no surprises, well that tells me the opinion is jaded by the fact that you wanted to love The Last Jedi so much only because it was a terrible movie and needed your expectations ""subverted"" that seeing a movie that had a well paced and cohesive story upsets you because it did not upset everyone else. It really was a lot of fun. The movie was ominous and dark, visually amazing... Characters were believable and not campy. Far more serious and if they ever decide to go and make a saga based in the old republic, then there is so much material introduced in this film that it would only further be a benefit to the audience. The movie is inspiring and renews any and all lost faith I had after that trash that was The Last Jedi. It isn't without a couple points of ""well that doesn't make a lot of sense"" or ""that didn't need to happen"" but what film does? This has the least of those problems by far. I've heard people say ""well what was that about"" and after I explain it was IN THE MOVIE they always say ""ohhh yeah"", so don't be that person. I hate to hype the movie up this much but it truly was great for several reasons.",1
1844,A fun action filled ride. Really enjoyed this and a great way to end the saga. A must see.,1
1845,SOOO GOOD—such a satisfying ending!! JJ did a great job with this movie...i was crying out of pure happiness throughout the entire movie. I can’t wait to watch it again!!,1
1846,"An amazing movie that somehow lived up to the impossible standards for it. A movie that ties together the entire franchise, and although has its pacing issues, pulls through in the end.",1
1847,EPIC!!! FANTASTIC!!! INCREDIBLE!!! STAR WARS AT IT’S BEST!!! What an incredible ride and to end off this saga in this fashion is nothing but AMAZING!!! Go see this and enjoy the Christmas present JJ Abrams gives us to close off this 9 chapter legacy. I am speechless and after reading all the critics comments I was worried. They should all lose their jobs when you have a masterpiece like this to watch!!! OMG and go see this with an open mind and enjoy this Star Wars eye candy!!!,1
1848,"Watched the triple bill on opening night. This movie made ep 8 worth watching, and somehow managed leave what seemed like the entire screening satisfied enough that about half of us stopped to talk about it afterwards.",1
1849,"Complix amb el que gran part dels fans esperaven. Té aspectes criticables, com qualsevol altra pel·lícula,  sobretot les s formen part d'una saga. El problema mes gran és de la trilogia, que de la peli en concret.",1
1850,Excellent family film very emotional. obviously those who don't like it have no emotions apart from hate.,1
1851,"Alright so this movie was actually really good, When I went into the theater I thought it was going to be absolute trash. The beginning was pretty bad, in a way how they crammed things together, but as the movie went on it was actually very well done. They covered most of the mistakes they did in the previous movie ""The last jedi"" I'm not going to give any spoilers in this review... but if you do want to see it, and your not sure. I would highly recommend seeing it.",1
1852,"Episode IX while not a perfect movie was still very enjoyable and fun conclusion to the new trilogy of films. The movie was well paced, never dragging, and filled with lots of awesome moments to satisfy fans. Go into the movie an open mind, grab some popcorn and just remember to have fun with it. If you're looking to pick it apart you definitely can and if you're looking to have fun with the movie you can as well.",1
1853,"Thank you JJ Abrams for the Star Wars movie of my dreams. Many of the problems of the previous Star Wars movies were corrected, and the inspiration you took from the books was very satisfying.",1
1854,"For me, the best of the bunch. An entertaining action adventure that doesn't try to be more than that. Star wars is not a battleground for social justice, political correctness or slapstick humor. This movie aced the tone, which was badly off with the last Jedi.",1
1855,"JJ left the franchise in a good place.  I liked all of the movie, it felt right",1
1856,"Best movie of the sequel trilogy, jj saved star wars! It really feels like star wars again, great homage unlike Last Jedi, which was really terrible!",1
1857,I absolutely loved it. Great ending. I loved the entire Star Wars franchise.,1
1858,"Lots of fun, lots of feelings, a great addition to the saga! Go in with an open mind and you'll love it",1
1859,"Some may choose to hate it, others may defend it in a way that seems pathetic, but I genuinely enjoyed this movie and consider it a thrilling and satisfying end to the skywalker saga. The lightsaber fights are some of the best yet, and Ben and Rey's character arcs are brought to a satisfactory conclusion, and while still leaving opportunities for the future. All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes star wars. It may not be the clone wars or return of the jedi, but it is special in a way that I've only seen in this trilogy, any I'm excited to see what they do with these characters in the future!",1
1860,"Why so hate, I love it, it's fun and very plausible. The story flows well, just need your imagination and some starwars knowledge which also include games and animations.",1
1861,That was amazing! I loved the “fan service”! I loved Rey! She’s incredible!,1
1862,"Look...there is no coming back from Rian Johnson's: The Last Jedi but somehow Abraham's does it and patches most damage that film did to the star wars franchise. As a die hard star wars fan since I was a little boy, I found this film somewhat beautiful and very enjoyable.",1
1863,"Total fan service and loved every minute of it.   Don't worry about all the sniffy reviews by critics who are not willing to admit how wrong they were about Last Jedi and trying to hide it.   This is rip roaring, fun, fast paced adventure and I loved every second of it.  It does make me think how better this trilogy would have been without that idiot Rian allowed to do a film in the middle...  If I have one complaint, this had so much to say, do and fix (from the last film) what it could have gone as two movies.",1
1864,"Parts of the ending were not what I envisioned and wanted but regardless. Overall, I absolutely loved it. Action packed. Always moving and I loved that.",1
1865,"A fitting end to the saga. The scope and pace of this film is monumental. Somehow JJ managed to find a balance between completing the new character arcs, paying homage to the expanded universe, tying up most of the loose ends... And crafting it into a coherent production. Hats off!",1
1866,"This was to The Last Jedi what Return was to Empire.A thrilling and exciting action packed ride which served as a heartfelt and fitting conclusion. Empire (the franchise high point) brought depth, nuance and subtlety to the franchise as did The Last Jedi (which I loved but is somehow seen by many to be the franchise low point ",1
1867,"Final satisfactorio, emocionalmente demoledor,una lastima que The Last Jedi haya dejado tantas preguntas sin resolver.",1
1868,What a way to end the saga! Some interesting plot twists and an emotional ending filled with memories. It was worth the time.,1
1869,"Heavy on nostalgia and fast paced, but great plot points and true star wars heart.",1
1870,"While the film isn't perfect, and no film really is, in my opinion and a true Star Wars fan, it's really one of the very best Star Wars films of the past 42 years. I just wish this movie were a bit longer and less fast-paced and they included some of the other Force ghosts from the past, but it is what it is. And for that and the amazing story that's told, concluding not just this sequel trilogy but all three trilogies, I think we should all really be thankful. There has never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan. The cast and music and story...were great! Ian McDiarmid (Emperor Palpatine) and Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) really stole the show and that's a great thing! I say, totally ignore all the toxic fans and so-called ""critics"" that love to hate on things. Anyone who doesn't really like this film can't even really be considered a true Star Wars fan because how could they not want the story and the Skywalker Saga to have an ending after over four decades!? Everything comes to an end. Whether you like the story, some of the decisions made and the ending or not, it's your opinion. And that's all it really is. Star Wars is not yours. You are just very lucky to be able to enjoy these movies, all of us are very fortunate to be able to have had them continue on in the form of this excellent sequel trilogy. I hope the silent majority of fans, like the Rebellion/Resistance itself, rises up and posts positive reviews because if you don't voice your support for this film online, the toxic fake fanboys and their insignificant critics, will drown you all out. They want you to feel alone and isolated, even if you liked the movie or want to go see it. So go see the movie, enjoy it, love it (hopefully!) and post positive reviews to counter all the ridiculous negativity!",1
1871,"This movie was everything i ever wanted from a star wars film. perfect ending to a great new trilogy. if you truly love star wars, then you too will love this movie. i cant wait to see it again.",1
1872,"Eu amei! Chorei, ri e gritei! Achei muito bom!! Não liguem para as críticas, assistam e tirem suas próprias conclusões!",1
1873,A good SW movie. Do not let Anyone tell you othetwise. Go and find out for yourself.,1
1874,"Really entertaining, it would have benefitted from being slightly longer since it had to deal with the fallout from episode 8.",1
1875,"After watching this film I felt JJ Abrams did what he had to do to fix the horror of Episode 8. I felt like you could watch 7 & 9 and still get a complete arc of this Sequel ""Trilogy"".Much like the Force Awakens where JJ did what he had to do to put faith back in to the fan base, JJ once again is forced to try and build trust in the fan base, and I think he does that. He acknowledges and in my view, fixes/retcons? the errors and plot problems with Ep 8. Mainly the Holdo Light speed Maneuver, Reys lineage, and a lot less Rose.The beginning of this film is rushed a bit as they bounce from planet to planet, but this is necessary to fix episode 8. There are nods to all three trilogies which either uses references to old locations, characters, or bits of plot to really tie all 9 films together. JJ also answers the key questions he posed for Episode 7 that Ep 8 ignores/changed.The plot is a little predictable, but its Star Wars, its a Hero's Journey, so you know what to expect. I really like the finale story wise and the central theme of the entire series is finally fulfilled. There are some subtle things that are easy to miss in that regard.  I really like what they did with Rey.  You do find out the truth about her parents. As for Kylo, I really liked his arc and felt he was the most fleshed out of all the new Trilogy characters. We also get to learn a bit more about Poe's history which was an interesting twist, and the banter between him and the other characters was enjoyable. Fenn has some new development which was foreshadowed a bit in the prior to films but was a good payoff. We also get a couple new characters (droids, aliens, heroes, villains, and of course Cameos.)Music is great as always. There are a couple fantastic cinematography shots, the wave scene reminded me of Interstellar a bit, and of course there is the ""WOW"" scene like with the death star explodes.I did not notice any direct tie ins to the Mandalorian series, so if you haven't watched that it won’t matter and it won’t get spoiled. It’s possible there was something small I missed. There are indeed some nostalgia moments in the film and one near the end that brings closure to a fan favorite character from the original trilogy that was completely unexpected but enjoyable.There are no End Credit scenes so you don't need to stay, but its interesting to see all the famous people that are storm troopers in this film. The list is quite long.",1
1876,I enjoyed this film and feel like it answered some important questions about Rey's family history. Also I think this trilogy is trying to inspire a whole new generation of fans and include them as part of skywalker legacy. Much of what was presented i expected in the last jedi.....better late than never. TFA still was best of this trilogy and at least this movie picked up where 7 left off.,1
1877,"Один из самых лучших эпизодов Звездных Войн, получил от фильма такую же бурю эмоций, как от просмотра эпизодов, снятыми Джорджем Лукасом. Рекомендую к просмотру.",1
1878,"A phenomenal end to the new trilogy. The performances from all actors is incredible, with Adam Driver stealing the show once more. But what this film really puts forward is it's comedic side. With some wonderful banter between characters, and just funny visual moment really put this at my number one favorite Star Wars Movie. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys fun sci fi adventures.",1
1879,The sequels had their problems but they somehow managed to bring it all to a satisfying end.,1
1880,"Watch it! I was very surprised with this movie. I didn't like The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi. There are quite a few coincidences that keeps the movie going. I wish that some would have been dragged out more, but oh well. The ending was not exactly unsatisfying, but I really would have wanted it to be different, I accept it but it's difficult.",1
1881,"well not as robust or creative as the last Jedi, The rise of skywalker is still arguably a quintessential star  wars film that fuses action and adventure with dark fantasy.",1
1882,"The sequel trilogy has been amazing, all 3 better than empire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
1883,"Star Wars is supposed to have themes that inspire greatness.Without spoiling:Redemption, Leadership, Self Sacrifice, not following our parents faults.These were all explored.This is the trilogy for a new generation, I loved it.TLJ made a lot of mistakes but this film was able to turn it around, make a movie that is watchable, has twists, has compassion, empathy, and the best fight choreography of the series.This series was leading to this moment and you owe to yourself to see it completed.",1
1884,"Brings the Skywalker saga to a satisfying close. Great acting, great effects, solid humor, and interesting new characters. It's a bit fast paced at times, but very enjoyable overall.",1
1885,Filme agrada fãs e não a crítica.Sou fã quero service.Obrigado jj abranhs,1
1886,"Funny how episode 8 got that excellent rating from the critics...this movie should have got that, I am a star wars fan but even for me episode 8 was confusing and should have went in a different direction, I liked episode 7 and I'm open for the new triology, j.j. had a different job to make the last movie imagine how hard it must be...I respect the last episode I really enjoyed it, it had almost no ""wtf"" moments episodes 8 had so I give it a 8/10 rating! I I have goosebumps moments and there were sad moments ... Give it a try and try to be open for a technical well done and funny movie!",1
1887,Could not have done any more with what they had to work with. A movie for everyone,1
1888,With the return of a true sith lord it all makes more sense it's also complete evidence that Johnson should have never been given a movie to make with the name starwars,1
1889,Thoroughly enjoyed! Too much fan service my a*s. Heck of a way to wrap it up!,1
1890,"Movie was awesome fun experience people. need to stop latching on to what they think they want and just enjoy the experience because it was very fun, exciting, and amazing emotional movie!",1
1891,"Rian was passed the ball only to pop it, duct tape it to a wall, and called it art. This movie does the best it can given the circumstances U-U",1
1892,"The perfect close to the saga, very nostalgic and well made. Not a disappoint to the fans so don’t be afraid of don’t like it if you like the others",1
1893,Much better than the disjointed second in the trilogy. Beautifully shot and directed. A fitting end to a multi decade series of films.,1
1894,This movie is so amazing!I kinda don't know what people are whining about this movie.I had no problem watching this movie.It is the end of the Skywalker saga,1
1895,"There is a lot of hate for this installment of Star Wars, and I do  understand that. But lets get things into perspective. It is quite strange to see Lucasfilm being in the exact same position that Warner Bros did with the Justice League as well as Universal's Furious series. They had an installment that sets a direction that was hated by long time fans, as well as losing a key cast member.  Essentially, what J.J. Abrams did was herculean, and  essentially involved a lot of retcon of the previous story line, dashed in with a dollop of nostalgia. (Hello, Palpatine) Sure the action sequences and production values are still stellar as usual, but the fact of the matter is that the plot buckles with all this strain.  The end result though is still pretty great, better than the worst of the prequels, but having a similar quality to the 'Revenge of the Sith'. The highlight: Daisy Ridley's and Adam Driver's incredible performance and chemistry as the two main leads. Both are so believable and great in their acting abilities that you get buoyed.  Kudos also for the rest of the cast, especially Billy Dee Williams. His charisma saved the day.  Yet, at the end of the day, this installment feels like having too many cooks cooking the broth. They buckled under fans' demands, and relented to them in the wrong way in many respects. Clearly, there is a lack of creative direction almost derailed this saga, and Kathleen Kennedy sadly is not as 'visionary' as Kevin Feige of the MCU. Alas, fuming Star Wars fans can take comfort that the Mandalorian on Disney + is an amazing show.",1
1896,"Rise of Skywalker shows us that making sure your writing is perfect makes a movie good, unfortunately, the mark was missed with this movie. The reason I score this review so high is not that it's Star Wars, but It was enjoyable to watch. Space battles were fantastic, the pacing was fairly smooth and the characters were fun to watch. All up, watch the movie, it's good, not perfect, but you won't hate it. Looking for a good Star Wars film? Rogue One is still the best Star Wars Fim of the decade.",1
1897,"Rise of Skywalker feels like a 6 hour movie set to fast forward, but it was actually very enjoyable.  Maybe knowing some of the spoilers ahead of time softened the blow of the dumber plot points, but I feel like the movie did the best it could with the position the previous two movies put it in.  There was no compelling villain coming out of TLJ, so I don't blame them for bringing back the emperor.  The movie was a lot of fun, but they really played fast and loose with the force abilities.  Also, the lack of really exciting, well choreographed lightsaber duels was disappointing.",1
1898,..............................................................I enjoyed it.,1
1899,Given the absolute mess made by Ruin on Ep.8 this was always going to be a difficult task. I think he did a great job with the few remaining plot elements and barring some janky scenes and the pathetic fake character death it's an entertaining film with actual Star Wars at its core.,1
1900,"You’re not going to get a “film” when you see The Rise of Skywalker, but that’s more than alright. It packs several emotional punches, hits all the right spots, keeps you on your toes, and manifests into a conclusion that leaves just about nothing to be desired. I can’t wait to see it again.",1
1901,"I don't know why millennials feel so betrayed by Star Wars. Is it because their generation can only truly identify with the prequel trilogy? Is this what has caused the generational chip on their shoulders to begin with? Because if you grew up as a kid with the original trilogy, laughed at the prequel trilogy before purging it from your memory and vowing never to acknowledge them again or, God forbid, expose children to them, then there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy a good time at this movie. If you're looking for this to be a foreign art house film or get triggered when the list of Oscar nominations comes out because the obscure limited release movie you heard about but didn't get a chance to see because you were too busy being offended by something you read about that happened ten or more years ago, then yeah. You might be the type who won't enjoy this movie. But then again, you're probably too busy waxing your beard with freshly squeezed avocado juice at Starbucks. But if you're not looking to start your own online university with an upper-level Cinema Appreciation class based entirely on the merits of this movie, and you are the type who can just sit back and enjoy seeing someone at least trying to provide a few more chapters to the stories you cherished as a kid because something is better than nothing, then yeah. You should go see it.  And bring your grandchildren because they will enjoy it, too. Just be sure to tell them about how hilariously bad the prequel trilogy was. Then tell them that it's ok to laugh at their parents when they get home because Star Wars hated them just as much as they hate Star Wars now.",1
1902,"As someone a bit saddened after TLJ, I really loved this film! As a fan of the other Star Wars films as well, I didn't feel like it was excluded irrelevant old news as I did in Ep.8. Much more positive vibes. This being the last one, to end the Skywalker saga, bring on the fanservice and homage! Loved it! Wanted more. Wish it was a longer film, fit all it could in such a relatively short time. Felt like a film for fans of all the films not just the latest ones. Thanks!",1
1903,"I had a hunch that this was going to turn out to be better than the ""critics"" reviews, which over the past years have become increasingly full of themselves, and not what they were watching. Kudos to JJ and crew for hanging in there and delivering. My son and I both enjoyed this immensely. It has a heart as big as a Wookie's.",1
1904,Not what I was expecting but ten times better I rank it second place in star wars movies 100/10,1
1905,"very very good, dont understand negative reviews.Best of the trilogy. Ren and Rey excellent",1
1906,"Es el fin de la saga no puedes esperar mucho más que esto, buen final para los skywalker, tiene ciertos problemas de ritmo pero en general es muy buena película",1
1907,"I thought it went back to being a good Star Wars romp.  There were some twists I didnt see coming, but being an avid novel reader should've seen coming.  It wasnt trying to be overly political or pushing an agenda like The Last Jedi.  It didnt have anything overly silly.  I think it had originality bringing it back into the quality of the original trilogy.  My favorite since Return of the Jedi!",1
1908,"Don’t let the reviews fool you. This is the best episode of the new trilogy. If you’re a long term fan you’ll love this movie overall. It’s not perfect, but it deserves the ten. Is there some fan service, sure. That’s not a bad thing though. TLJ was anti fan service just to subvert your expectations. That’s like thinking you’re about to drink apple juice and you get iced tea. Wow, weren’t you surprised. No I wanted apple juice. This film is Apple cider, and you know what, I loved it.",1
1909,"I LOVE this movie.  As a fan of Force Awakens (saw it 5 times in theaters, yes) this movie delivered the goods.  This was the sequel I had in mind.  All the references to earlier films (both subtle and obvious) were handled cleverly, and that led to a great star wars feel throughout.  This felt like a Star Wars story at its most elemental and that’s what makes it so worthy.  Light versus dark, the passing of generations, battling one’s inner demons, friendship, overcoming adversity by banding together.  The wonderful and optimistic themes of the series are all present.  This movie does so much right and is so fun that I’m not even going to nitpick it.  I’m just very thankful that they gave us one more great movie in this trilogy.  JJ and the cast and crew did a phenomenal job.  There are images and scenes in this movie, especially toward the end, that I will never forget.  Inspiring.",1
1910,This movie is absolutely amazing. Loved every minute of it. Call me a fanboy if you'd like but I enjoyed what they salvaged from TLJ,1
1911,"Saw this last night and thought it was fantastic! 9 of us went to see it, ages ranging from 10-49 and everyone loved it! Ignore the critics, a great way to finish the saga! 10/10...",1
1912,Loved it. A fitting end for a 42 year saga.  I will miss the Skywalker's. Hoping Disney has some more Stat Wars stories to tell.,1
1913,Superb! Throughly enjoyed it. Much better than TLJ and a great end to 3 great trilogies,1
1914,I must be stupid.. I dont get the hate.. it was starwars. Goes to show dont follow everyone's opinions blindly. I liked it. I dont care for Reylo but I still liked it and Rey is a Mary sue. but I still liked it,1
1915,"The movie is pure fan service but a really well done fan service. JJ Abraams chose to work safe so it is not a movie that goes far from the expectations. The 3 main characters (rey, finn, poe)  are finally reunited and working togheter on the screen, and the movie, for the first time in this trilogy, doenst goes because of the original ones, the main characters are really finn, poe, rey, and kylo. So this is it, its a great movie that finish this saga in a great way that have a lot of moments that may do we fans cry. And like the whole star wars saga, it always stays in family cry",1
1916,After the abomination that was the Last Jedi I didn’t expect much from this movie.  To my surprise it is good and the best out of the modern trilogy and the prequels. Still can’t beat the original trilogy but is definitely a must watch for Star Wars fans,1
1917,"Had my expectations really low for this one. As a fan of star wars I was expecting it to be bad (Not bad as disgusting and awful like ""The Last Jedi""), but it surprised it me how well it fixed some horrible decisions made in TLJ. Could have been better, but because for all the crap it had to fix from TLJ (Restoration of some good character arcs like Poe, Finn, Luke, improvement for Rey and Kylo's arc, disappearance of the awful romance between Finn and Rose) it ran out of time and some scenes seemed a Little bit rushed. Sure that a lot of things could have been better explained, but are more logically structured than TLJ.Sincerely, it's the best movie of the sequels, and average compared to the prequels. Falls short compared to the original trilogy.",1
1918,"Leans into the themes of the Skywalker Saga. The ride is flawed, but it is a fun ride. It ends the Saga, and opens the door for the sandbox to open wide.",1
1919,"Much better than TLJ. Better than I was originally anticipating. Certainly the best of the new trilogy. The bar was admittedly low and it definitely has its share of flaws. It never quite reaches the greatness of the original films. However, there are some very memorable moments awaiting long time fans.",1
1920,Definitely another masterpiece from Abrahams and and epic conclusion of the whole Star Wars saga. Well done.,1
1921,"While it has flaws, it also has the merit of keeping afloat the ship that Rian Johnson almost sank, which is no small feat. People keep complaining about the amount of Fan Service, but come on, it's Star Wars, that's part of the charm, it's never been an over intelligent saga, just a family space opera.",1
1922,Thought it was an 8 but balancing for these moronic low scores! Great ending!,1
1923,"I've loved Star Wars all my life, and I enjoy watching this movie immensely. I think it's a beautiful thing how broad a spectrum of opinions there are on this movie: I'm glad we're not split so neatly in two anymore. ^_^  SW is a hot mess and always has been. Besides other human beings, it's the most imperfect thing I love so much. And I think the best is yet to come!",1
1924,Best sw film after return of the Jedi episode vi because it is so much fun don’t take it seriously that’s what episode 1 is for yo,1
1925,"Star Wars episoxe IX The Rise Of Skywalker is exactly what we all wanted and what we deserved, unlike the Star Wars The Last Jedi which was a big mess and a cuss to the fan base.",1
1926,"Thank you J.J for making sense as much as you could, with what Rian Shambles left you with.",1
1927,"JJ did a great job piecing the franchise back together. Still some holes, but certainly not the garbage the ‘critics’ are painting it out to be. The same critics that loved and praised the crapshoot that was TLJ.",1
1928,A tight fast pace film that feels fun and it's meant to delight the fans who love star wars and not the jaded masses who want the sky and will not settle for the moon.,1
1929,A movie that was made for Star Wars nerds for sure. Casual audiences may not get it or appreciate some of the more nerdy parts but boy for a true Star Wars fan was it everything I’ve ever wanted. Deep into the lore with some truly cool scenes. Loved it. Not perfect but amazing still.,1
1930,"Movie's very fast, but still for me as a fan it is still a very good ending for the whole saga.",1
1931,I’m not sure why this is getting such bad reviews. I think it has been the best one. This film has more dimensions that makes it very interior analyze. The force dyad is particularly interesting for the plot.,1
1932,"Film yang bagus, menghilangkan banyak pertanyaan di beberapa episode.......",1
1933,"Outside of the awkward Leia cameos, it's an awesome movie. Stop being self-righteous haters and deal with it.",1
1934,"This episode is amazing, it expanded the scope of the movies by adding to the lore of the Sith. The Star Wars fanbase needs to stop complaining over every installment and just enjoy the films. Guess what makes the MCU so successful? It's fans don't crap all over each movie, asking for impossible things.",1
1935,"Great movie.  Most people that ""hate"" this movie either hate a woman lead action character or the ""PC social message"" from this trilogy.  They were going to hate on this movie no-matter what.  I've seen all Star Wars movies in the theater, my kids have seen all the movies as well.  They loved this one just as much as I did.",1
1936,"Just finished watching it about an hour ago. Its far from a perfect film, but what Star Wars movie is perfect? I think they did a good job trying to fix everything the Last Jedi did. I was surprised that I actually enjoyed the film, and got teary eyed four times during the movie. The pacing is super fast, and kinda makes the film feel rushed, but I get why its like that. I know there will be a ton of haters hating on this new addition of Star Wars, because hating movies on the internet is the ""trendy"" thing to do, but its a damn good movie, and feel content with how it all ended. Its not the ending I wanted, but its still good. Can't wait to see it again.",1
1937,"I have grown up with the franchise and am a hardcore fan. Not every Star Wars movie has been perfect, and while this one isn't either, the enjoyment factor as a fan is a 10/10. If you are a fan you will love it!but It is a great ending to the saga!",1
1938,It was a very emotional movie with really good surprises and action. The best ending to this epic saga that I love. I think the people that maybe won't like this movie are OG Trilogy fans that couldnt move on the OG trilogy. At the end this MOVIE is the official end to the Main Star Wars storyline and people who just want to ignore it is a fool because like or not DISNEY OWNS THE STORY NOT YOU and is just facts,1
1939,I really must say I liked the movie and i did not like the last jedi so this was make up for this one.,1
1940,A worthy ending for 40 years of cinematic history. Didn't thought they will manage to clean it up but JJ Abrams did so :),1
1941,"This is a film made with love for Star Wars fans. It may have some pacing issues, but if you’re a Star Wars fan, you should love this.",1
1942,As a hardcore Starwars fan I think this is an epic conclusion to an epic saga. What I take away is that JJ Abrams is a genius.,1
1943,The visuals where amazing and the music was great. Story was not perfect but still the soul of Star Wars was present!! I left the theatre with a good feeling and that’s the important part off it!!,1
1944,"I loved every second of it, its not perfect don't get me wrong, but this is a beautiful way to end this story after the mess Rian Jhonson made with the last jedi, thank you JJ Abrams. Yes it's a bit rushed and a bit all over the place but that's pritty much because again due to Jhonson.",1
1945,"Some reviewers seem to be expecting a level of dialogue and plot that is consummate with The Godfather. It's a Star Wars film, with a target audience of Star Wars fans, and it hits that target audience well. The first 15 mins skips around a bit too much for my tastes, but beyond this point The Rise of Skywalker is a enjoyable romp that sends series back to where it should be, it's not quite the original trilogy, but it's not far of. I'm not going to give spoilers, and but if you liked the originals and/or episode 7 you'll like this. I felt both thrilled and emotional in parts, just go an enjoy it.",1
1946,"The film was forced to be original having already rehashed EP4-6 in EP7-8, and for that reason alone was good.It clarified everything in the previous films, giving them a new context so you can look at them as a bit less of a rehash.A lot of respect was paid to what the Jedi really are. You'll have to see it to understand.As the trailers show, Palpatine is still around in some form - and he absolutely should be. Of course he foresaw the traditional concept of an apprentice overthrowing their master and had spent his life working out how to cheat death like he hints in EP3.It suffers from the same flaws as EP7-8 with the characters being aware of things that the audience are not, confusing the audience sometimes.There is a lot of back and forth and I'd like to say this is a good thing but it didn't feel good. You'll have to see it to understand what I mean by ""back and forth"" since it could mean many things.The lore of the antagonists was not explained very well to the audience in this film, leaving them to guess it.Overall 9/10, with the 1 remaining being for the stated flaws.",1
1947,This movie truly hit all the right areas for me answered almost all the questions i had about the characters. Carries scenes were masterfully done at no point did it feel like they had been drafted from another movie. Ultimately leia was amazing in the movie as for pace sometimes it does stammer but in most parts an amazing ride enjoy,1
1948,"I have seen this movie in 3d and can only say that this is a masterpiece. It does not only introduce and maintain strong characters to and of the Star Wars Universe but fills a lot of Star Wars universe issues up, background content etc. Some would say it also fixes past Star Wars movie ""errors"", if you want to name it this way. The cast is simply astonishing and belongs to the finest actors in our generation. The emotionality of epic scenes for the movie itself as well as independently of and for the entire Star Wars universe is multiple times given and a must for any Star Wars fan as well as anyone who ever had a bit of sympathy for Star Wars, which is nearly the entire planet. How the directors managed to build these stable and strong emotions up, maintaining them and slowly unleashing them toward an audience that is used to emotions in movies during uncertain real life times with sometimes very chaotic emotions, is art second to none. There is one issue with certain very rare appearances of characters and their ""behaviour"" which does not always seems to match how you would expect them to behave or act, but only of side characters in 2 or 3 minor scenes. This is the only issue that I would have to name ""odd"", but the special effects alone turn it into a 10 out of 10 movie. The main actors turn it into a 12 / 10 stars movie and the directors and producers turn it into a 15 / 10 stars movie that defines the Star Wars universe new.An epic movie with an even more epic story and ultimate epic end of the movie. If you think that I am a bit exaggerating? No I am not, just watch the movie.I have become and even bigger Star Wars fan.The following comment is really just for those who have interest in the ""behind the scenes"" meaning of Star Wars, especially when seeing Star Wars as a media presentation of the real US satellite defence program named ""Star Wars"", to which the franchise belongs as it is a powerful instrument when a satellite defence program receives additionally a massive fandom and related support behind.I recognised a small easter egg in the movie and the scene placement related to the background information of the Star Wars Rebel insignia. It was for me, for someone who is highly critical of the Islam, always an issue when the Rebel Alliance emblem could be seen similar to the flag of the state of Brunei. The easter egg has shown me the real background information for it. When you close the Rebellion symbol then you have the symbol of the Bajorans, from the Star Trek universe. This for someone who is a lot in the background information of Sci-Fi made in USA was simply fantastic to grasp that both symbols belong together and belong to a wider US government psychology for symbols in sci fi appearances, especially how long they have been planned. Others would say it is just coincidence, but for this I simply know too much of US government symbol placement. Not to mention the near subtle only association for a ""phoenix"" symbol, of which I had to read myself and would never come to that associative conclusion.",1
1949,"I loved this movie. I've grown up with Star Wars and felt this was a fitting conclusion. I think it's hard to please everyone because people have invested so much into these films that nothing could live up to there expectations. To me, the film was better than I had expected. I also wonder if the score is lower because when I try to rate the film on here, the scores come up as 1 to 5. I need to remember that the highest score is a 10 and recognize that I can scroll over.",1
1950,So many critics hating this movie ,1
1951,I enjoyed the movie but it wasn't as good as the original 6. It did have lots of surprises and twists and turns,1
1952,"A fitting end to the trilogy. Last Jedi created a lot of problems that this movie had to solve, they did the best they could.",1
1953,"I'm giving this a 10 simply because there are way too many unwarranted 2's and below. It's by no means a perfect movie, but it's light years better than the divisive The Last Jedi.My family and I saw this twice on the day of release, and found it very enjoyable.JJ Abrams seems to remember that those of us that have been here since the late 70s are fans as well, and he peppers little apologies for TLJ throughout the film.",1
1954,Definitely the best of the sequels. Actually probably the best star wars film since Return of the Jedi,1
1955,The best of the trilogy just Perfect thanks jj You make me happy for christmas,1
1956,"I don't understand everyone's need to hate Disney, I thought it was an amazing film with lots of interesting twists and turns and questions answered.",1
1957,It's fast paced and exciting the entire ride. Familiar faces and new ones take you on a journey through history in the Skywalker Saga with this climactic conclusion. It's an emotional roller coaster and certainly brings the story to an end.,1
1958,"Daisy Ridley y Adam Driver consiguen ""salvar ""de una manera brillante una saga que ha sido vapuleada por la edad del odio del Internet, una época en la que por desgracia muchas personas encuentran su diversión en destrozar películas, videojuegos y el entretenimiento en general con críticas de odio y menosprecio al trabajo de los demás de manera gratuita.Kylo Ren y Rey consiguen mantenerte pegado a la pantalla con una película y final de la historia trepidante.La película no está dirigida ni por Jonshon ni por jjLa película es dirigida por los fans de star wars y se convierte junto al imperio contrataca y venganza de los sith en una de las mejores cintas de la franquicia",1
1959,"I've seen the movie, as a Star-Wars fan I love this ""closing"" movie. I did have the feeling that some scenes needed a bit more breathing space, because some seemed too hasty to me. But overall it was a great movie! Too bad there are so many sour reviews here on Metacritic, pathetic. To everyone who still has to go: Don't be discouraged, go to the cinema and enjoy it, and don't sit there (in the cinema) like a critic. Merry Christmas and a Happy 2020.",1
1960,"Okay. Episode 7 was too edentulous, but not bad. In episode 8, I was simultaneously delighted with bold ideas and upset with some of the worst scenes in Star Wars history (like Super-Lea flying in space). Episode 9 is not flawless, but lacks the shortcomings of the previous two. His own flaw is the rush with which events unfold. I can assume that Johnson has moved too far away from Abrams' original idea, so JJ had to correct the narrative and simultaneously tell the plot of the new part, which led to the fit of two scenarios into one. Even so, Episode 9 is one of the most dynamic in the series. It has a lot of beautiful and spectacular moments and locations, the characters behave quite adequately, especially given the general rush of the film, which sometimes does not give them time to experience. And I think that of all the plot porridge that came out at the junction of episodes 7 and 8, Abrams carved out quite nice and logical. Not the best part of the franchise, but probably the best part in the trilogy. Perhaps Kevin Feige will have a more holistic narrative in future films.",1
1961,"Best Star Wars movie so far. All said and done, this movie is the most rewatch-able.",1
1962,"JJ Abrams does a wonderful job trying to save the series. It's corny, but it's Star Wars.",1
1963,"J.J. Abrams does it again! Great ending to the saga. Yes, the plot is active, but you'd expect a finale to have all that stuff in there. Most questions were answered satisfactorily and the actors hit their mark.",1
1964,"Movie would have benefitted from the complete exclusion of Rain Johnson from the trilogy but still manages to deliver a captivating story that brings a close to a story filled with characters so beloved by fans old and new. Reinvigorated my belief that I am, indeed, still a Star Wars fan.",1
1965,"I’m not going to post a lengthy review. Just a few words:This is it, people. This is Star Wars. Some people will like it. Some people won’t. But this is the real stuff. If you don’t like this movie, it’s just that you don’t like Star Wars. There is nothing wrong with it. I’m sure there will be tons of other movies out there for you. But JJ got so much right with this one. Just the scene with Ghost Luke catching the lightsaber that Rey throws away (and behaving as the good old Luke we knew and loved) is priceless.... one of many metaphorical undoings of TLJ mishaps. There are a few nitpicks here and there, of course, but overall I exited the cinema smiling ear to ear like a child, something that haven’t happened yet with the new trilogy.",1
1966,Absolutely loved it!  Thank you J.J. Abrams for an awesome cinematic experience!,1
1967,"This movie did so much with the remains The Last Jedi left behind it tried to restore and finish the trilogy at the same time. I didn't dislike The Last Jedi though I am aware of and understand the disservice it did to the rest of the franchise. This movie The Rise of Skywalker fixes most issues and continues to provide a great storyline with a lot of fan service to make it entertaining, allowing you to say your goodbyes, to cry, and regain hope. It isn't perfect this could have been more than it was, please treat it as a separate movie there's so much more to love and appreciate, it is an honor to have been able to see it to the end.",1
1968,My Grandma and I loved it!  Totally didn't make us cry. I don't understand the the bad reviews but to each their own.,1
1969,A lot of fun to watch! All about the fans which is ok. Subverting expectations is not always necessary.,1
1970,It is fast paced.Episode 8 now doesn't really matter.Some brilliant StarWars moments. The horses are idiotic though!It is good. Stop whining,1
1971,The rise of Skywalker was very entertaining it received a round of applause from the audience.  The force was strong with this movie a great job with the visual effects and action,1
1972,"I feel the rise of skywalker is one of the best Star Wars movies released from Disney Star Wars and I give it a solid 8.5/10. Sadly, what ruins this movie is the fact that many fans, critics and general movie fans were already prepared to hate this movie before its release and according to my opinion, bad press and critics are to blame for this movie's poor ratings. I feel many fans and critics rate this movie on the basis of the last Jedi and I have to agree with them that episode 8 is what ruined the Disney Star Wars saga for good.  I also find that many critics believe this move is a rip off of The return of the Jedi and I have to say the scenes that made Return of the Jedi so memorable among fans is the basic essence of this movie, and that basic essence which powers Rise of skywalker makes it a cohesive ending for the 9 film skywalker saga.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My personal complains against this movie... (minor spoilers):I find the return of the emperor a bit odd as we all saw Palpatine being thrown down the death star shaft for good by his apprentice Darth Vader and was assumed dead but he is back, and the explanation for his return is a bit lacking.The sacrifice of Vader seems as if it was thrown down the reactor shaft of the death star.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In general, Rise of skywalker is an amazing must-see movie and I recommend it to all fans of all ages. I also like to urge the audiences to “see through the lies of the critics”, and enjoy this film with an open mind. I would like to close my review by saying may the force be with you.**********************************************************************************",1
1973,"The movie wraps up the series well, and even explains some things that were left unexplained in the previous two films. I found it satisfying and interesting, and thoroughly enjoyable. I'm excited to see where they go next with Star Wars now that this whole saga is over.",1
1974,Solid ending for the saga!Every characters have their moment of gloryThis may be one of my favourite episode of all,1
1975,"it's not a bad movie, i enjoyed seeing the movie, yes it has few things that makes you think: wtf? but in general you can go to the theater and enjoy 2 hours of your life seeing the movie",1
1976,"Great ending of Skywalker saga. This movie isn't perfect, but it's really fun.",1
1977,"It was made for star wars fans obviously a few issues as far as setup from the last Jedi, and it was burdened with tying up alot of loose ends, but I loved it",1
1978,"I loved the movie so much! I'm glad they pandered to the fans wishes. Critics have an agenda, didn't see what they had hoped it would be so bashed the film. Very clear on that front.",1
1979,"I’m giving this a 10 mainly because of the toxic fandom around Star Wars. By no means is this movie a 10 or a 0; It’s more like a 6 or 7. Yes, the overall story could have been tighter but that comes from a lack of storyboarding and Ryan Johnson writing the final movie into a corner. I absolutely loved The Last Jedi and what it tried to do, but honestly, where do you go from there? Yes, Ray Is a Mary Sue. She wears her plot armor hard, but it makes since because as the darkness rises, the light rises to meet it. If Kylo, Snoke, and the Emperor are all still kicking around then it would make since that the light, Ray, rises to meet it. There it always balance in the force, unlike the fandom. Going forward, can we all start acting like adults when discussing our space wizard movies.",1
1980,"As a life-long Star Wars fan of both the Prequels and Original Trilogy this movie delivers an experience unlike any other I’ve seen. The amount of twists and turns is almost too much to absorb in one viewing, but this expansive journey adds so much to the lore and heart of the saga. Not a perfect film by any means, but it’s answers for previous questions, spectacular battles, and overall wow factor really hit at home. The late Carrie Fisher also gets the send off she deserves in this film and I have to say I was holding the tears back. If you’re a Star Wars fan what are you waiting for? Go see it!",1
1981,"Is it the best movie of the series? No. It is not. However, that doesn't mean that it lacks merit and character. It is over-produced and you can see DIsney's strong hand all over it BUT it is still A STAR WARS MOVIE!! I'm more frustrated with the so-called ""fans"" of Star Wars ragging on it. Be honest to yourselves, no matter what they came up with you were going to hate on this movie. The last film (Last Jedi) proved to be so divisive that it was inevitable that this final installment would be met with mixed feelings.All this being said, I had an absolute blast! I will openly admit I saw the glaring flaws and plot holes that were there (it's hard to miss some of them) but it never once stunted my enjoyment of this finale. I cannot wait to see it again and, even more, start from episode 1 and watch all the way through at home with my future children. This series did one thing right throughout its entire life: bring people together to watch a movie. There are few things as generally wonderful and powerful in this world as sharing that common bond with so many people.",1
1982,"Everything I could have asked for and more. Enjoy it, it's the last one. They did such a good job of fixing all the universe shattering crap Rian Johnson did in the Last Jedi.",1
1983,"Saw 9 this morning, liked it a lot better and I was very reluctant in going. Pleasantly surprised and in a strange way let's me enjoy Star Wars again, now maybe I'll get around to seeing Solo which kind just passed by. Reviews are right in a way, it is ""safe"" as in it tries to actually be a Star Wars movie as you know and even expect it, but to me that is a good thing. And a lot better than the arrogant, pretentious artificial dissonance that was 8.",1
1984,"While this film is not perfect, it does a lot of things to make fans happy! It is a fitting end to this trilogy and while I wish it was longer to allow for more exposition, it was fun and beautiful! It’s not necessarily a perfect ending to the saga as a whole but it’s a good movie nonetheless and deserves to be checked out! Definitely a Star Wars movie through and through!",1
1985,"Action, nostalgia... It's another Star Wars movie and I enjoyed it immensely!",1
1986,The arc with kylo ren made me love this movie. And people tend to not enjoy all the fan service but personally I was fine with it. Movie felt more like star wars than tlj,1
1987,"I came to this movie with no expectation and was positively suprised. This was best movie of the trilogy. Maybe it was not perfect but its just a movie and it did its part. I cant imagine it to be any better.I like the searching for Sith artefacts part, the hidden Sith planet, huge battle in the end that made more sense then the one in beginning of episode 3. Lightsaber duels were little bit boring to be honest. And the final duel between Palpatine and Rey could have been better.",1
1988,"No es la mejor de la saga, pero resuelve muy bien lo que ha sido star wars todo este tiempo, un gran final para una gran historia. Arreglo el desastre de los últimos jedi, aunque sobran esas bromistas made in Disney, a mi me ha dejado buen sabor y me emocionó.",1
1989,"Not a bad ending to a bumpy trilogy ride. For those that enjoyed TFA, Rogue One, and Solo, you will enjoy RoS. It hits a lot of the marks you would expect of a Star Wars movie and while it does not dig too deep, it delivers the excitement back to the fans. The first 30-40 min has a large amount of jumping around to get the story caught up to where things need to be to close out the film. If many of these initial elements could have been in TLJ, this transition would have been much smoother. I found myself really appreciating elements from TLJ that set up and fit very well into RoS to tie characters together and reinforce actions they made while leading to the next actions. Overall, all the marks were hit for these characters, especially Leia, Kylo Ren and Rey. Action was on point and there is lots of it, Humor is in the right places, and the nostalgia of what Fans like has returned. Well done all things considered.",1
1990,"Much better than many critics would have you believe, yes it has some problems due to the mess left behind from The Last Jedi and sets off at a lightning fast pace to pick up all the pieces. However it shines whenever Kylo Ren is on screen as it turns him into a truly imposing figure and Adam Driver is excellent. This also leads to some of the very best interactions between the two leads and I only wish we got more of this and of course JJ making all 3 which would have solved many of its problems. Overall a very entertaining ride",1
1991,This movie is easily the best Star Wars movie  ever!!  If you are a fan of the older books (now called legacy since 2014) you will love it. The sith are back!,1
1992,It's like taking a drink from a firehose but the water is so delicious you don't care.,1
1993,"Some criticisms of the pacing of the first 1/4 of the film are valid, but it is a Star Wars nerd's dream. Bottom line: entertaining and definite servicing for the hardcore fans.",1
1994,loved it for the most part. biggest problem for this film is that it needs more setup than the other two films in the trilogy gave it. the hole trilogy needed one cohesive vision from the start and it hurt this one the most.,1
1995,I think this was the best JJ could do with the dumpster fire he was handed.,1
1996,"This movie was fast paced and packed many great things into it. I'm a long time Star Wars Fan, and I think the movie was AMAZING. Go make your own opinion on it and see the movie!!! May the force be with you, always.",1
1997,"Had a little trouble deciding on the rating for this. The left side of my brain is frustrated with the many plot and structuring issues, but the right side of my brain was absolutely entertained by this.The movie has maintained the current and original trilogy's legacy of being the definition of a popcorn film. The action is great. The movie looks fantastic, really the most visually impressive of all the Star Wars films.The cast and characters are again great. I'm glad to see the trio of Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley), and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaacs) all together for a substantial stretch of time. The interactions between the three are great. (They could've had more time together.) I also liked the new characters with the exception of the Knights of Ren who despite being first teased in Force Awakens, just don't do enough.The humor works well. However, I felt even though C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) has been comic relief since the beginning, he was too aggressively jokey. I liked that this continued the last film's theme of hope.Now for the problems. These three films changed creative control from JJ Abrams to Rian Johnson and back to Abrams without the Disney brass doing enough to pre-plan or control consistency. Abrams did a lot of things I found so maddening that I'm shocked that the producers greenlit them. The major threat in this movie introduced so quickly and with such little plausibility. Reveals and plot elements pop up so arbitrarily that they don't feel natural at all. It's a little like poor fan fiction. Abrams jams way too much story in here in order to arrive at the conclusion he wants. I felt Finn just wasn't given enough room to breathe and was disappointed with how his story ended.The whole change in directorial voice is exacerbated by the fact that Abrams like Johnson before him is actively resistant in running with what he is given. Abrams does something that is a major slap in the face to his predecessor, which is so mishandled in its execution. It takes you out of the film. Say what you will about the Canto Blight subplot in The Last Jedi, but I liked the character of Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). I didn't like that they cut her role so short in this not to mention completely axed her set up from the last film as a romantic interest for one of the characters. It's like Abrams decided he didn't like her because he didn't create her and she wasn't in his plans.J.J. still has his Achilles heel of being too blatantly nostalgic. It isn't half as prevalent as in the Force Awakens, but there are a couple moments where it raises its head and is downright insulting to the audience.I know I talked way more about the cons and the pros, but it's easier to talk about what doesn't work than what does. When it works, the movie pulled me in and would make forget the problem areas when they weren't around. It still embodies the essence of a Star Wars film. I'd rank this as the weakest of the trilogy but better than Solo and the prequel trilogy. This is one of those films where your opinion could really go either way. I've found both negative and positive criticism of this to be accurate. If you're already uber angry at the first two movies and didn't think or were unsure if you wanted to continue, then you really might not want this. However, if you enjoyed the ride so far, I suggest you take the gamble.",1
1998,Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. A fitting ending to the Skywalker saga. I found it very thrilling and smiled from ear to ear.,1
1999,Best Movie of the sequels.....................................................,1
2000,honestly enjoyed the movie despite the hate it gets from wannabe movie directors.,1
2001,"What a film! Yes it has flaws, yes it plays it safe, but it did the near impossible task of having to end a forty year saga, trying to fix the wrecking ball of the Last Jedi which left the film with no identiable antagonistic forces, while also rescuing the Star wars legacy AND setting the series up for the future. It did a remarkable job and once again the critics are lost at sea.",1
2002,"Honestly I went to watch the movie hoping the movie would be at least decent, and I left feeling like it was the best Star Wars movie or too two. Go watch the movie, it has a little of everything, and it’s not a copy and paste like the first couple.",1
2003,Loved it! I thought JJ did a fantastic job... Delivered satisfying conclusions to story arcs that were setup in the Force Awakens. Can’t wait to see it again!,1
2004,Tbh what they did with Palpy I thought was super dope. It might not make sense to some but the way it all went down gave me chills.,1
2005,"No es la mejor película de star wars, ni de lejos, pero al menos es mejor que el episodio 8 y cumple su función de película palomitera",1
2006,"Good end of saga, i like it. But Ben and Rey relationship is something strange.",1
2007,Wow! ,1
2008,"The best movie from this new trilogy, IMO it should have lasted a bit more to fix all the havoc Rian Johnson movie did (on his movie the Last Jedi). It would have been nice to understand more on what happened -the plot- between the Last Jedi and the Rise of Skywalker, and to explain the stories and whereabouts of the main and secondary characters, other than that is a balanced end to this new trilogy",1
2009,Fixes the stuff TLJ ruined...pretty good movie. If only Rian Johnson was never hired,1
2010,"I’ve been a rabid Star Wars fan all my life and I have to say that this movie was deeply satisfying. There were many surprises along the way that were not expected, especially the big twist of Rey being The Emperor’s granddaughter. I read a lot and listen to Podcasts on Star Wars and I never once heard anyone suggest THAT theory! It was all just a great way to tie it all up. On top of that, the visuals were amazing, there was good comedic moments, there were NO annoying characters dominating the story line, the score was sensational, there were plenty of geeky fan moments, the plants and overall atmospheres were awesome, the red storm troopers and ultimately the battle sequences in the air, in space, on land and with lightsabers were perfection. I will see this movie again and again just like I did in 1977! Oh, and I loved the fact that they revealed force healing in The Mandalorian on TV the day before this movie came out so there was a small connection to what we’ve all been following on the small screen. Amazing job Disney! I suggest that if anyone rates this movie in a negative way that you are not a true Star Wars fan and you just don’t get it. This is grand entertainment of the highest caliber. This is moviemaking, storytelling, artistry, technology, creativity, vision, and just plain old passion that Walt Disney would have been proud to put his name on. I’m sure his force ghost is standing close to all that made this movie and he’s giving two big thumbs up!",1
2011,"I really liked it.  Sure, the opening is muddy and some parts don't land well but the majority of it is a love letter to the series.  If you're a fan, you most likley love it.",1
2012,"Not hyperbole: The best Star Wars movie since ROTJ. After TLJ, I was skeptical going in, but it was the best movie-going experience I've ever had. It was gripping, emotional, surprising (but not forced) and most importantly, fun. Each to his own, but I don't understand how anyone who has ever enjoyed a SW movie could hate on this one. Give it a chance -- it'll surprise you. The entire theater was cheering after it was over.",1
2013,"While it seemed like they tried to fit a whole sagas worth of movies into one movie, I thought that Rise of Skywalker was great! Surprised that they were able to end the trilogy with an actual story.",1
2014,Not a hardcore fan of Star Wars but liked it a lot intense and well rounded closed pretty well all the characters and the action sequences super cool,1
2015,"Far and away the best Star Wars movie of the Disney era. Fixes all of the **** recons TLJ made. It is a little jarring at first with all the jumps, but it was still amazing despite that.",1
2016,This movie has pacing issues byy it t otherwise is a fun sequel to The Force Awakens. Weird that they waited four years to release a sequel to that film.,1
2017,not perfect but I enjoyed it and that's all that matters to me. critics know lots about cinematography but f all about star wars,1
2018,Enjoyed very much tied up the whole Skywalker saga very well and keeps you on the edge of your seat,1
2019,"When I went to the cinema to see the previous movie, The Last Jedi, the plot managed to break the fourth wall by it's sheer stupidity several times. That did not happen this time. In the context of Star Wars (books+movies) the story makes sense, less so in context of previous two movies. There are also some cringe moments, minor plot holes etc. However, this is definitely the best movie in the trilogy so I'm ready to overlook these minor problems. Sad part is that it's probably better to skip previous two movies (definitely Episode 8) completely and watch only this one and you would get a better experience.",1
2020,"I found The Rise of Skywalker just as enjoyable as the rest of the current trilogy and as a Star Wars fan you could tell the amount of effort that went into the whole production, with a fantastic atmosphere and plenty of tangible sets, aliens and droids. I'm not going to lie, I had a smile on my face the whole time. For those nitpicking, since when has the series ever been devoid of cheesy moments? Much better than the critics had me expecting!",1
2021,"I went into this movie with an open mind and knowing that Rian Johnson had created quite the divide and that J.J. Abrams had a lot to close in just one film. First off, I left the movie theater with a smile. The movie was a balanced pace and always kept me engaged. I dont know why people are always complaining about this film. What did you expect when Abrams had to start from where he did? People also need to have an open mind when it comes to the story. For example: some fans are mad that it ruins Anakins legacy. Did it though? He brought peace and balance to the galaxy for a long time. How long did you think that balance would last? Forever? The film also had a nice array of cameos from several people like Wedge Antilles, john williams, and on and on. Movie critics who dont know anything about the Star Wars universe need to just shut up and not even review the films. Again, from where this film had to start off at, it did a very good job of bringing the series to a close and the fact that it brought respect and dignity back to lukes character and the lightsaber is more important than anything else.",1
2022,"While this film had the impossible task of retconning The Last Jedi and correcting the trilogy's dues, all the while capping everything from the prior trilogies, it gets it done in splendid fashion. The story of light and dark coalescing into one and snuffing out true evil once and for all is a captivating one, and the perfect way to finish off this story. Ben and Rey's story is brought full circle. Luke and Leia's story is, quite literally, brought full circle, bringing a proper end to the Skywalker lineage. While I don't appreciate all of the creative decisions in The Last Jedi, RoS helps bridge that appreciation for the whole franchise. It does justice to the characters and to the fans who don't go to the cinema to be challenged, but who go to love a good story and Star Wars. I have spoken.",1
2023,The Rise of Skywalker was a really good movie with a giant problem (spoiler warning) Ray kills the Emperor and ruins Anakins legacy. But other than that the movie was pretty good,1
2024,"Excellent movie! Fast paced, excellent visuals, and a great story. It’s a great addition to the Skywalker saga!",1
2025,"Great film with everything I was hoping for, the only problem is the pacing is slightly rushed but that is to be expected given the vast amount of storylines that needed conclusions",1
2026,People need to stop complaining it's a great movie lots of action and was able to wrap things up even tho they weren't as some wanted,1
2027,"This movie is everything I wanted to see from Star Wars.  I have no idea why so many people are unhappy with it.  I enjoyed it from start to finish* and it satisfied everything I was hoping for after the (mostly) terrible Last Jedi.  *Except the very last line in the film... that was lame. :-)Still, overall, this is now my second favorite Star Wars film. Go see it and decide for yourself!!!",1
2028,A fitting end balancing the force of those who crave the traditions with those who embrace the new characters and elements too! See it for yourself. I enjoyed it quite a bit!!,1
2029,"I went to the theater with low expectations. To me, no director could stick the landing with such high stakes. Somehow though, both my friends and I left the theater satisfied. Abrams had a choice between upending norms to please critics (muddling the clarity that a nine-film saga desperately needs) and pleasing fans with a solid film. I've read reviews calling this ""fan-service,"" but how can this be a bad thing when the support of fans is what has made Star Wars financially and artistically independent from Hollywood for decades. Another criticism sure to surface is calling Rise of Skywalker ""predictable"" or ""lacking in imagination."" First, I outright dispute the claim of lack in imagination, since I don't think anyone could have predicted where parts of the film went in terms of special effects and Star Wars lore. The second concern - predictability - is somewhat more valid. However, my question is: what else could you expect from Star Wars? From the start, George Lucas' goal in Star Wars was to distill the common threads of every human mythology into a universal and optimistic space opera. That universality is the cause of Star Wars' worldwide success. Think Rise of Skywalker was predictable? Operas are predictable. Get over it. Now, if we can all respect a style of story telling that has existed as long as humans can remember, we can appreciate the film for its actual content. Instead of focusing on conventional plot like community college art professors stuck in the modernist era, we can see that Rise of Skywalker has nuanced themes of morality and historicism. The most obvious theme is a historicist analysis of how tradition intersects with action. With the prequels ending in the Revenge of the Sith and the original trilogy ending in the Return of the Jedi, it is clear that the Rise of Skywalker is a statement on how to proceed into the future. Essentially, the saga functions as a Hegelian dialectic. The conflict between the Jedi and Sith produces a synthesis: the rise of skywalker (purposefully lowercase). The Rise of Skywalker proposes that we can respect and receive support from our past (a respect clearly not understood by critics chiding Abrams for lack of originality), but create new traditions and ways of thinking. Behind this simple moral truth that will be grasped even by the children in the audience (the true audience of Star Wars from day one if critics could ever remember the innocence of childhood), is a complicated and self-reflexive postmodern masterpiece that tells us that, despite the fact that the democratization of art has necessitated its simplification to its most universal form, meaningful new ideas can be produced. In lighter matters, I felt that, despite being an all-consuming finale, Rise of Skywalker still managed to be the funniest of the sequels. It helped that Abrams avoided the forced gags that made Last Jedi nearly unwatchable. Moments like Ren's 4th wall breaking ""ow"" seemed to reach a little toward the humorous self awareness that my generation actually appreciates. Babu Frik might be my favorite part of the movie.",1
2030,This movie is definitely this what I wanted. I recommend this movie for everyone!,1
2031,This movie is a perfect end to a beloved saga. Everything wonderful about Star Wars coming together for an emotionally satisfying end.,1
2032,"Amazing movie to finish offf and also having to clean up after RJ killed off many story lines. Must see in theaters, stunning graphics and emotional movie.",1
2033,Very well crafted with constant action that keeps the audience engaged throughout the film. JJ Abrams does try to sway the story but in a way that the future audience will not be affected by. It brings a fitting end to the Skywalker saga.,1
2034,"It's a really fun movie that managers to tie virtually all lose ends. The story makes everything just fall together into the bigger picture and there is still world building that makes the universe feel alive and not limited to the main storyline. I understand how people might be disappointed, but given what J. J. Abrahams had to work with it was an excellent ending. It's a great way to end the saga.",1
2035,"This was a good star wars movie, I watched after the last jedi in the last star wars trilogy.",1
2036,"Best acting of the Disney era movies. It was a very poetic ending. Was not bored one moment throughout the entire movie. If you like Star Wars and the Star Wars mythology. You will love this movie. This was by far the best movie of the Disney era. Two thumbs up. If you want to feel good, watch this movie. The triumph of good over evil.",1
2037,"Buon film, degna conclusione di 40 anni di saga, un vero amante di star wars non puo non amarlo",1
2038,Veldi bra film det dårlige var at det skjer lite effekter på stolen i 4dx det gode var at det var veldig mye action i filmen,1
2039,"Tutto sommato il film ti trascina fino alla fine con un ritmo incalzante.Alcune scene forse fanno un po' storcere il naso ma durano poco alla fine.JJ Abrams ha strozzato l occhio e non poco ai film storici della saga, con colpo di scena incredibili ma con un finale forse non degno.",1
2040,"Mi è piaciuto tantissimo e mi ha fatto anche piangere, però il lavoro che ha fatto J.J. l'adoro secondo me è una bella conclusione",1
2044,"JJ Abrams fixed what Rian Johnson tried to ruin. Awesome action, awesome plot. What you expect from a starwars story.",1
2045,"Not as bad as everyone is saying, it’s got some minor issues, but is far from terrible. Strong 8",1
2046,If you loved star wars a kid you’ll love it. I would call it a 9 but these low scores are ridiculous nit-picky BS so let’s raise. Next trilogy do not allow to directors try to take the story in two different directions.,1
2047,"A good modern movie that concludes an awesome trilogy. If you liked the force awakens, you should like this one.",1
2048,The movie is action packed but too cluttered. Overall entertaining and fun.,1
2049,"Great movie! The only flaw it has, it’s that it came after Episode 8. True fans will find many things to love and newcomers won’t have a hard time getting on board.",1
2050,"A great showing, especially taking into account how terrible TLJ was.  Not a perfect movie, but a fun adventure and a good way to end the sequel trilogy.",1
2052,"Epic end for this trilogy. A lot of bad reviews show the actual ""not how I guessed It"" negatives reviews we see in Internet from lost series end. Go to t'he cinena and have fun.",1
2053,"Is not a greatmovie,but I felt so many emotions, Seeing Leia for the last time, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is symply amazing and I enjoyed Rey for onceBut I have to say that this type of Fan Seervice is simply bad",1
2054,As an avid Star Wars fan I hated TLJ and was iffy on TFA but this is a masterpiece. Absolutely loved it.,1
2055,"It’s a fun popcorn/kids film, just like every other Star Wars movie that has ever come out. If you’re a diehard incel Star Wars fan, this film will probably trigger your blue balls to explode like the Death Star. If you enjoy fun fan serving films you’ll definitely enjoy it.",1
2056,"Rey didn't know who was, and the made her insecure, so She was weak instead Kylo know everything, he had a specific goal so was more powerful than Rey.And in the final Palpatine remains the Only one sith and Rey the Only one jedi, so he rapreseted all sith but she rapresented all jedi and Rey won.She didn't have Beverly really partents aso Luke and Leila are the Only Two person t'ha helped Rey like parents would do, so i think this Is the correct choose.Bye.",1
2057,"Um filme eletrizante, mais tradicional da nova trilogia. Mas algumas decisões pareceram sem graça, esperava mais da origem da Ray, Kylo Ren se redimindo também deixou a desejar.",1
2058,"Having hated the previous one, this Star Wars has somewhat redeemed the whole trilogy for me. Yes there were some inconsistencies and plot holes, but as a long time Star Wars fan, I felt it was familiar, and part of the same tradition. It was also also inspiring and innovative. The way the storyline wraps up adds new depth to already complex and interesting characters and although one particular plot twist left a bitter taste, it was not enough to ruin the experience. The visuals, while still very much blockbuster-like, had more artistic ambition and there were many beautiful shots. Overall I cannot wait to watch it again.",1
2059,I enjoyed the overall movie. It concluded everything. And I was happy to see it twice,1
2060,"What a fun movie. If you want to hate it,  you will but I recommend just going in and having fun.",1
2061,Me encanta star wars por eso la califico con 10 y me encantó como final de triologia,1
2062,"Is this the best Star Wars movie? Absolutely not, but is it a bad Star Wars movie? No, its honestly pretty good. I think expectations are a big element to blame for the lower reviews overall. The best way to explain this movie is your Senior Year Graduation Beach trip. Its not going to be your wildest fantasy or the best thing ever, but its a great send off for friends we've come to love. Its far from perfect but its well above average and I would recommend anyone to see it from casual new fans to old hardcore ones. All the other elements like Audio and Visual's are all amazing per disney's unlimited budget. The fact that people rate this lower than 4/5 given its audio and visuals alone should not write reviews, while story elements can be shakey and 'fun' throughout the story should never be the entire review it should be an element. I personally didnt mind, I consider myself a hardcore fan but I also didnt expect this to be the best movie in the series nor really be able to finish that strong given the place of the series going into it.",1
2063,"I think overall this film deserves more than many people say , the emotion it made me feel was very strong",1
2064,You can hate it all you want however the plot of the trilogy evolve and conclude in a spectacular way.Maybe we could have had something better but the way everything fits mostly together and end the saga without feeling bloated or slow is a miracle.I really enjoyed the experience.,1
2065,No force-fed liberal talking points. Just star wars. Best of the trilogy. This movie saved star wars for me. Get bent liberals.,1
2066,"Amazing film, great and exciting experience start to finish a must watch of 2019.",1
2067,"Review en Español, veterano de la saga, creo que quienes venimos viendo todas las peliculas, podemos decir que esta triolgia es la mas flojita, pero tambien la que mas ha innovado en cuanto a trama y personajes. El ascenso de Skywalker, para mi gusto la mejor de las 3, y el final muy interesante. Sin mas, es una pelicula palomera para pasar la tarde y pues 2:30 minutos de pelicula con muy buenos efectos especiales.",1
2068,"Спасибо за новую часть , лишний повод сходить в кино , рекомендую",1
2069,I think jj did the best he could after tlj. Yes it has its flaws but was still enjoyable. 8 for the sequel trilogy and 7 for its place in the skywalker saga.,1
2070,"Is it perfect absolutely not. Is it a bad movie absolutely not. Does it satisfy me on the conclusion of the story arc absolutely.I personally don't believe that Rise of Skywalker deserves the hate that it is receiving. However I don't believe that it deserves a perfect score, for me this movie is average at best which is the reason for an 8.",1
2071,I loved it! Was a very fun and exciting end to the Skywalker saga. Thank you Abrams!,1
2072,"Movie was okay not bad as critics say, bjt not legendary, gave it 10 because it had to clean the mess the last jedi has done and it did clean so 10/10. Bravo jj abrams",1
2073,"Filme foda dms .Adorei , o melhor da saga na minha opinião. O foda eh q as pessoas n querem coisas nova e só viver no antigo",1
2074,Excellent movie. Wrapped up things perfectly. Stunning visuals and great acting,1
2075,"It tries and does fix some of the mess done in Last Jedi and Force Awakens. Fanservice? Well yes please, fans are behind all good support to movies, why wouldn't you want to service them. But it's also much more respectful of the brand and the Jedi idea.",1
2077,okay so lets start by saying i really did like this movie no doubt theres alot going on alot of adventure and action if i had to make a gripe at all its that there is some spots in the movie that are slow there is alot more good then bad but its definetly not flawless however i do recommend it,1
2078,"A beautiful ending to a wonderful trilogy!It is admittedly a little rushed, especially at the beginning, but overall it's a gripping story and a perfect ending to the greatest story of all time",1
2079,"They finally bring the cast together as a team, and the actors have great energy together! We finally get to know Rey. It really throughs you into the action.",1
2080,"I thought that this was one of the best Star Wars movies made in a long time, and by far the best of this series.",1
2081,"Amazing conclusion to a fantastic trilogy. A swift and sweeping story line packed with action and adventure from the start to end. The early introduction of old advisories brings the saga in full circle and in doing so creates a sense to inevitably to its conclusion. For me it’s another perfectly told good vs evil story, a tail of struggle and redemption that will be a family favourite for generations to come.",1
2082,Absolutely beautiful movie that masterfully juggles multiple characters’ story lines and rewards long time Star Wars fans.,1
2083,"Star Wars is back! Journey back to the galaxy far, far away with all the excitement and magic of the original Star Wars Trilogy. From the moment it begins to the all too soon finale this film surprises and delights with wonders that never cease and unhoped for expectations exceeded! Now to do something I have not done since the original trilogy - go see a Star Wars Film again! Star Wars is back and once again the Force is with us!",1
2084,"Top 3 in the franchise. Somehow with even my low expectations coming in they managed to pull it off and save the ending. I loved it, I loved the Easter eggs/call backs and I live chewy’s ending. I know it was fan service but I was emotional and I don’t get emotional a lot.",1
2085,"Great movie super fun and exciting and John Williams score was phenomenal, love the fact that Ray was a palpatine, but chose to be a Skywalker therefore keeping the Skywalker legacy alive.",1
2086,"Para fãs é um deleite de fan service(aviso que não é o melhor da saga, mas nem perto de ser ruim). Como filme somente é um sólido 7. Mas como final dessa trilogia um 8, pois apesar de alguns erros, a falta de vc coerência entre os diretores prejudicou esse último filme. Não é culpa de nenhum dos dois e sim de os três filmes não estarem sobre a direção da mesma pessoa. Como fã eu acompanho Star Wars em outras mídias portanto sei que para mim várias respostas serão respondidas.",1
2087,"This was the impossible task for JJ. Finish not just 1 trilogy, but 3. A whole family saga.Ive rated this highly as I go to the movies to be entertained. I was very entertained. I went into the screening a huge fan of 40 years and came out just as big a fan.I could pick fault in the movie and even agree to an extent with some of the harsher reviews. That been said, the decisions made by Abrahams and co, were a fraction of the infinite possibilities. He took it one way and no one was going to agree on the correct way, if there was one. Ultimately, he has made a fast paced, enjoyable, great looking, proper Star Wars movie. And boy was there a lot of Star Wars in it.I would like to see a second version of this movie, continuing The Last Jedi themes and without all the RetCons. But taken at face value, I left the movie theatre a happy Star Wars fan.",1
2088,"An incredible film that ties in perfectly with the lore of all the films. Just because we don’t see characters from older movies, doesn’t mean it doesn’t tie in to them. Themes and concepts dating back to RotS, were brought to the forefront in this film, and were tied in beautifully to the Story established in the sequel trilogy. Take the power over life for example. Ben solo proves that Love is the key to save the ones you care about from death, and gives his life to save Rey from death, thus succeeding where anakin failed. He finished what he started. And it shows why palpatine could never discover this secret, as he is incapable of love. This is just one of many things that tie all the films together. And overall, the story is thrilling, the score is amazing as usual, and justice is done to characters that were more or less neglected in the last Jedi.",1
2089,"Quite nice, quickly-going adventure. Some mistakes and non-finished themes but still interesting and persuasive ending of the story",1
2090,It is perfect love it so much. Plot beats make sense it is emotionally involving and makes up for the mistake that is the last jedi,1
2091,"There are some definite good points and bad points for this movie, but overall, it is well worth watching. There aren't any boring periods like in many movies, nor is it overly frenetic. Everything takes about the amount of time it should.The story makes a number of choices I certainly wouldn't, some of which I disapprove of, but does them reasonably well, and always serves the characters effectively while still having a clear and comprehensible plot.Both visual and sound effects are very well done, without being overly distracting. I have very few complaints in this area.Most of the characters are very well acted, and it uses the right number of them. What new characters there are don't ever get in the way, and most of them have pretty great moments. The mainline cast all perform well. The only real issue as far as the cast goes was that Carrie Fisher had an important role to play, and they couldn't really do that with the footage they had on hand. It is very noticeable. They probably should have rewritten the plot to not involve her.Most importantly, this movie leaves the Star Wars world in a state where there is a lot of potential for more Star Wars to follow after, and at the same time neatly wraps up this story.Unlike The Last Jedi, the world is left in a richer state than it was in when the movie started.",1
2092,Great Star Wars. Abrams managed to take the franchise out of the fire. Final and terrific tour de force by John Williams with the soundtrack too.,1
2093,"Debo decir que después de verla en el cine en formato 3D que estoy ampliamente sorprendido, supera en todos los aspectos a su predecesora The Last Jedi, los tres actos se sienten bien parejos entre sí, la acción es constante, repleta de aventuras que exponen a los protagonistas a literalmente todo, el factor nostalgia que caracterizó a The Force Awakens acá prácticamente no se ve teniendo que depender de la esencia clásica de la saga, el desenlace si bien no me pareció malo, se me hizo cliché y repetitivo, de igual forma lo disfruté, los momentos épicos y emotivos tienen la desgracia de ser muy fugaces y no lograr conectarse del todo con ellos, sin embargo, fue toda una experiencia cinematográfica si de aspectos técnicos hablamos, para ser la supuesta última película de la saga, siento que le falto un poco de tacto.",1
2094,don't listen to the hatters.  If you are going to see star wars for intellectual romp and expect perfect acting and writing stay home.  Its meant to be fun and that it was.  My wife myself and my kids loved it!!  Had us guessing and engaged the whole time.  Was some of it cliche based on the original trilogy...yes and that's ok!!!  We live in such a cynical time and cannot just enjoy something for what it is.  People are so angry over a space opera not following there plot expectations.  Get a life and lighten up.,1
2095,It was a little smashed together in order to fix all the BS that Rian Johnson screwed up on. Finally brought balance back to the Force.,1
2096,Only relatively minor dislikes. Overall enjoyed the movie and it’s easily the best of the newer movies,1
2097,"This movie provided a very good wrap up to an epic story spanning decades. It is amazing that JJ was able to pick up the shattered remnants of the dung pile that was The Last Jedi, and create something that made me happy to be a Star Wars fan again. Well played JJ. PS - We all know Rose had no place in Star Wars, getting her out of there was the greatest accomplishment of the trilogy.",1
2098,"It certainly has its problems, but manages to wrap up 9 movies into a fairly satisfying ending, despite TLJ sabotaging what I assume was meant to be the original plot of this series. Enjoyable, but built emotion upon several bad writing decisions. Adam Driver once again was a highlight.",1
2099,So much better than the visual diaherra from that last movie.  It is sad to think how much less rushed the pace of this movie would’ve been if JJ directed the second movie as well.  Plot lines would’ve been way more fleshed out.,1
2100,"I liked it a lot more then I thought I would. Easily the best of this trilogy, not that that's a high hurdle. It felt like they deliberately went out of their way to repudiate everything Rian Johnson ruined in TLJ. I laughed at a couple of them, they were so obviously a swipe at RJ. Was a fun movie. Had a couple of dumb spots, but a solid 8 out of 10.",1
2101,I must've seen a different movie than everyone cause I thought it was amazing. Everything I wanted and everything I didn't know I wanted. Star Wars is THE best franchise.,1
2102,Awsome movie! My family wants to see it again.I think Abrams did a fine job putting the movie together regardless of what some people think.,1
2103,"This movie is better than given credit for by other reviewers. It's well made, shows lots of emotion and drives a sensible plot home for fans of Star wars and those who may be casual sci fi fans. My kids and I thoroughly enjoyed and will watch it again",1
2105,I for one love this Trilogy it not the original  but it really done well. RAY is a really likable character  and like most of the cast,1
2106,entertaining movie. Options to end the saga limited by the Last Jedi. Hope to see more stories about Rey in future.,1
2107,Kids in their 30s hating everything because they're dead inside from everything they hate. It's a cycle. Alcohol helps.But this movie is better for  real kids that still have life inside.,1
2108,"This was a great and satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga. I agree that there was a lot of fan service, and it was a bit hurried, but I haven't had this much fun in a star wars movie since episode 6. People are saying that they don't even mention the things that happened in the prequels, and it doesn't pick up exactly where episode 8 left off, and to that I say, who cares? The prequels were a hot mess that did nothing but complicate things from The originals for the sake of giving an explanation for questions nobody ever asked for. And episode 8 was uninteresting, unsuprising, and completely derailed everything 7 had set up. At least this had some continuity to the overall arch. Look, this movie is not perfect. But it's fun. It's satisfying. It's Star Wars. If you like lightsaber fights, force standoffs, space battles, whitty banter, and classic good vs evil, you will LOVE this movie. Go see it.",1
2109,"Considering this latest Star Wars trilogy had no clear vision going forwards for what kind of story it wanted to tell, the Rise of Skywalker is a triumph. It's just a shame JJ didn't direct and control the direction of the trilogy, as the franchise was almost completely scuttled by TLJ. Thankfully we had the marvelous Rogue One and SOLO movies to see us through. If you haven't seen those by the way, do so now.Rise of Skywalker manages to undo most of the harm done by the feckless TLJ and would appears to have managed to steer the series into a great climactic ending. It's no use me reviewing the film scene by scene, others have done this, plus, lets face it, many of us feel we own the Star Wars franchise and that's why we're all so passionate about it, so my opinion among so many others means little. Suffice to say, I've seen every Star Wars film on its original release over the last four decades, and still remember seeing the first one at Staines ABC cinema in the UK in 1977. To this day, Star Wars excites me as much now as it did that young boy 42 years ago, and I'm not done with Rise of Skywalker yet. Having already seen it twice since release, I have two more viewings planned with other friends, and one of those will be at the London Waterloo Imax cinema. Rise of Skywalker closes out the nine films series with action, fun and a lot of emotion. Go and see it.",1
2110,"Ce film clôture parfaitement cette nouvelle trilogie et l’arc des Skywalker. Parfois, il faut juste se laisser voyager et profiter.",1
2111,"Le Meilleur star wars de cette nouvelle trilogie, il est juste magique ! L'image est superbe, les scenes d'action sont top et enfin on a les reponses qu'on attendait.",1
2112,"It was all I expected from a Starwars movie. Great entertainment, I accept the weakness of this third trilogy as I've accepted the ones of the two first trilogies. No regret, I loved it.",1
2113,"Perfect?  No.  But this movie was far better than The Last Jedi and come on folks...it's a space movie not JFK.  A breath of fresh air for my taste.  Yes, JJ took some liberties and there was a lot crammed into this film, leaving some holes.  But the big question got answered and it sure was visually fantastic and entertaining as hell.",1
2114,"I really like this movie! It is a  Starwars movie! I know it has its flaws and it seems like there are 2 movies in one. But JJAbrahms had to clean up all the mess ""the Last Jedi"" (the worst movie of the franchise)  left (which is a shame how critics consider this movie better than this one",1
2115,"A very nice bookend to The Last Jedi. The Star Wars story comes to a nice close (not the ending I would have chosen, but one that is executed well, nonetheless). I do not believe it undoes much at all about TLJ, but in fact complements it very well. I think it does many aspects of the saga justice, and others not so much. But overall, the film succeeds and provides a rousing adventure that I was extremely entertained by. I think a lot of people want this movie to be something it's not. The acting is superb. The writing is not flawless, but if you really analyze any movie in the saga, you'll find them to be a mess, even the OT that I grew up with.The plot makes perfect sense, though. I don't know why some people find it ""broken"" as I've read.. It's not a genius plot, but it's not even CLOSE to a failure. I will be seeing it again.",1
2116,Summer Blockbuster style popcorn flick. Fun experience and worth the cost of admission. Doesn't survive critical analysis very well and doesn't really justify the existence of this trilogy.,1
2117,The best of the trilogy. Had a grin on my face throughout and an emotionally satisfying end to the Skywalker saga.,1
2118,I love this film don't get the hate can't wait to see it again ray is the best,1
2119,"As good as it could have been considering how poorly planned this sequel trilogy was. After The Last Jedi, Abrams had very little to work with and as a result The Rise of Skywalker moves at a breakneck pace and tries to fit a lot of plot in. This movie is by no means perfect, but it is action packed and finally makes the new characters (Rey, Poe, Finn) interesting. It was hard not to leave this movie and not feel a sense of disappointment however. Not with the movie specifically, but with the missed opportunity of the entire sequel trilogy. How Disney did not plan a cohesive storyline is truly shocking. The trilogy is disjointed and clearly rushed, offering nothing to further the original trilogy. Going forward, I hope Disney treats this property with the respect it deserves and not rush out content.",1
2121,Incredible film. Wraps up the saga in the best possible way after Ryan Johnson messed it up so badly.,1
2122,"General rule of thumb, don't let others opinions influence your choices; surely the critics were seriously not expecting intellectual high brow innovation? . I am not a star wars devotee but have enjoyed the franchise from the beginning and have found each robe reliably entertaining, this final episode was everything I expected and loved about it. Form your own opinions and go see it it's great",1
2124,"It had a lot of nostalgic and emotional moments to bring the saga full circle. I liked better than TLJ. The passing on the torch story with Luke and Rey was better.Palpatine seemed forced in because of fans. They disliked that Rey was force sensitive and her parents were nobodies. So to explain how she was force sensitive they made her the grandchild of Palpatine.It was fast paced and felt like an exciting Star Wars movie. It had spaceship battles, lightsaber duels, and Sith vs. Jedi. I'm ok with how it end and glad the people behind it isn't going to continue and Skywalker story.Should stick story new story, characters and timelines to not such high expectations to meet.",1
2125,The Rise of Skywalkwer brought me joy and entertainment.  That's what movies are for are they not? I thoroughly enjoyed this film and was genuinely emotional and happy throughout its entirety.  Well done JJ Abrams :),1
2127,"Good film, Inflection but this Star Wars and A little new magic, I'm counting on spin off.",1
2128,"Like Scorcese, se can say this is a theme park, not a movie. Considering this is the last movie in a entertainment franchise, entertainment was what I was expecting, not necessarally a great script.",1
2129,"The fans who are disappointed with this film went into it expecting fine art; a perfectly-written masterpiece that makes them feel the same magic that they felt as children watching the originals. Those are impossible expectations to meet. Others are complaining because they incorrectly view this film through the context of the ""culture war"". The truth is, what we got was an entertaining, action-packed sci-fi spectacle with vintage Star-Wars aesthetics. The acting and the score were exceptional as always. The film does make the mistake of using incredibly fast pacing and not requiring much sacrifice from the heroes, but a film doesn't need to be perfect to be entertaining. If you can look beyond a few flaws and the influence of nostalgia, you'll enjoy it.",1
2130,I was terrified that I would walk away feeling like I just watched the last season of Game of Thrones. This film did not disappoint. Excellent conclusion to the story of our generation.,1
2131,"Better than expected, but could have done without 50% of the hard-to-believe action sequences. I don't expect movies to be realistic, of course not. But I do expect the thing happening on screen to at least adhere somewhat to the rules of physics, even though it might be sci-fi.Many things seemed a bit too convenient throughout the movie. But at the end it still boils down to a satisfying end to the saga, especially after the disappointing The Last Jedi.I quite liked how they wrapped it all up. Could it have been better? Should it have been different? I have no idea. To me, as a casual Star Wars fan, it felt right and worked quite well.The fan service moments did tend to be a little too much at times, but most of it was pretty awesome. I didn't mind that they put it in there although much of it seemed unnecessary. The copy-pasting of old scenes was a bit much at times, but at the same time I kind of loved it.Entertained throughout, great acting, great characters, and Rey was awesome! It felt like a whimper after The Last Jedi, but in this movie she is given the attention and story she deserved. I'm glad this movie exists and I'm happy the saga is now done.I wouldn't mind more Star Wars movies, but Disney should probably let it rest for a bit now...",1
2132,"It was actually pretty good better than I expected, it wound up the Star Wars saga quite well a good couple hours of entertainment.",1
2133,"This is by far the best of the three most recent movies. It will not answer all of your questions, but it tries to address some of them. It's a lot of action and fan service. I found it enjoyable but a little flat. They did an excellent job including Carrie Fisher in the film using extant footage and body doubles. There is none of the freaky recreation we say in Rogue One. At several places the narrative suffers from the her absence, but I respect the decisions her estate made. I saw the first film in the theater when I was 13. To varying degrees, every film after Empire has been a disappointment. This was no exception. But I thought it was a good attempt at resolving the ""sequel trilogy.""",1
2134,Loved the movie one of the best star wars movie ....End of saga...story lives forever...,1
2135,"Don't listen to the critics!  It's one of the best Star Wars movies ever!  The emotion is this movie is every bit as intense as Empire Strikes Back. The critism on this movie is hypocritical because you could say the same about the Original Trilogy movies.  Hell, Chewie even does a Tarzan yell in Return of the Jedi.  If that movie came out today, these same people would tear it apart.  Just enjoy the movie, it even makes LAst JEdi a better movie.  I'm done with hating in the fandom of Star Wars.  ANd I'm so happy JJ Abrams gave me this movie and made me feel as strongly about a new Star Wars movie as I did in the theaters in the early 1980's.  Life is good again for me:)",1
2136,"This was not an easy thing to do! The respectful way that this ties in every leg of the saga that came before it without lending to any of its shortfalls has to earn JJ Abrams absolute fan loyalty! This is nothing short of the best way to end a series, a trilogy and a legacy in the the Star Wars universe. I will be going back again and again!",1
2137,"An epic end for the saga, but it could be better.The Soundtrack was perfect for this movie with melodies of all 8 previous movies.",1
2138,Very satisfying ending to the saga. Couldn't have done any better and all of the armchair directors need to get over themselves.,1
2139,"Гарне закінчення для всієї трилогії! Без сюжетних дір не обійшлось, але в цілому я задоволений. Окремо хотілось би виділити саундтрек, який тонко підкреслює епічність всього, що відбувається на екрані. Гра акторів - на висоті!",1
2140,"I thought the movie cinematically was very breathtaking. Honestly JJ I knew wasn’t going to disappoint when it came to that. But the story line suffered a bit due to its servers degree of fan-service. To be expected at a quiet attempt to save the finalization of the trilogy, TROS seems to bounce all over the screen with new scenes picking up precedent before being able to process the current emotion which overcame us in the movie. If you’re a Star Wars fan you will love the character arcs/developments, as well as the featured characters in the movie.  I highly suggest it compared to the weaker 8th installment to the Star Wars movies. A Star Wars fan will be screaming with childhish delight in the theatre.",1
2142,"An epic ending for an epic saga. This film holds all the pieces of iconic universe together. As most people rate this film in a motion picture perspective, it’s not the right way in this case. Rise of Skywalker is first of all an ending, proper ending for Star Wars saga. It’s needless to say that it exceeded all my expectations. It does not only finish the long-lasting story but explains previous, underrated episodes of sequel trilogy. Star wars is a saga for fans, random viewers won’t enjoy it. Film introduces us to many new Force tricks and abilities, which follow the canon of the universe and explain us everything happened in the galaxy before. Sides of the ForceThrough the film we see a fight between light and dark sides of the force - not only in epic lightsaber fights but also in characters’ emotions. While Ben Solo is trying to overtake Kylo Ren, Rey tries to stop her inner darkness from taking control of her body and mind. Through their emotions and actions we sometimes feel one of their personalities slightly overcome other. Little things that make this film actually good.This film has a lot of little aspects you most likely didn’t notice while watching the movie. Anyway, they really improve overall impression of the film. For example Finn does quite look like a ex-stormtrooper by missing shots much more than other characters, or Ray and Ben Force balancing each other while they are fighting with themselves. Such details and references really make you understand the work behind this movie. Those above are only two of many little ‘experience improvers’.EndingEnding of the movie not only shows us a very emotional and massive battle but also leaves the universe prepared for new characters to step in. Let me explain. I expected the final battle to be epic, but in reality it overcame all of my expectations multiple times. It’s understandable, because it’s finishing galaxy’s most recognisable saga. Hundreads of thousands ships of all sizes cooperated to destroy Emperor Palpatine’s fleet once and forever - that even sounds massive and epicEven though Rey destroyed the last Sith, it’s not the end. As we know from original films, Force has to be balanced. After Palpatine’s death force became more disbalanced, than it ever was before in Star Wars universe. So, there has to appear someone, who will return balance to the Force - but this time by using dark side. There are plenty of candidates for that role, but that’s a story for another time. It’s a smart move from movie creators... and that makes it so good. OverviewFilm is a must-see for all Star Wars fans. It finishes the saga in most epic way possible and has tons of easter eggs and references to original trilogy, so you most likely won’t be disappointed. It definitely does not deserve a rating of 53. In my opinion, it’s solid 95.",1
2143,A movie that I'll watch over and over again and love every minute of it. Great way to end the Saga,1
2144,Unquestionably entertaining if you are not hardcore fan you going to have fun!,1
2145,"Overall, cool star wars movie. I liked how they did the Rey Kylo storyline, and really the fight scenes were really cool.",1
2146,"Finally it is over and with a bang.  Overlong and several logical inconsistencies, and, once again, my local theaters just don't know how to adjust the lumens on their digital projector leaving the screen grainy and much too dark. But, .... the direction of the movie makes most complaining irrelevant. J.J. Abrams hign speed editing and camera work makes this movies a real joyride to experience and will make you want to watch it a second, third, maybe a fourth time to catch everything you missed on this roller coaster ride of a film. All questions from all the previous films will (ALMOST) be answered. This is not a movie to be watched, it is one to be experienced.",1
2147,"I thought it was a good movie, no worse than 7 or 8, better than 1 to 3. Not as good as 4 to 6. Some silly plot holes. Very silly sinking sand scene. The end was reasonable.",1
2148,"I can understand some folks not being blown away by Rise of Skywalker. It's not the ending to the trilogy that shatters expectations and rises above the just-OK quality of its two predecessors. Yet, for all the hate the movie is receiving by some, it's actually quite good. Star Wars has been about nostalgia for literally everyone that saw the original trilogy before the extra films came out and Rise of Skywalker taps into that nostalgia just enough to give you that warm and triumphant feeling now-and-then. The way this story was told wasn't outstanding - it just wasn't, but it was adequate enough to not harm the enjoyment of the film. Rey's story arc comes full circle and I love the background and how it plays into the events that culminated into the final moments of this 9th episode but I also think there were better choices to be made in how early the big reveal comes. In fact, Rey's narrative in this movie is a great microcosm of the entire film. While it definitely works and is nice to see played out it never really builds significant momentum despite having most of the movie to culminate into that epic moment that Return of the Jedi had (and the parallels between the two movies is quite significant when you step back and consider all that happens).Side note: C3PO's presence in this film is excellently played when the setting allows for it and I truly enjoyed what JJ Abrams and company did with him here.I'd have to agree with some of the critics on the film as a whole though. The true identity of this movie felt vague. I didn't see a Star Wars that sought to be its own thing in a succession of movies. The Last Jedi definitely tried to do that (though I disagree with what it ultimately did and how that story was told - enough to consider it the worst of the 3 new movies). I would have liked JJ Abrams to take more chances with Rise of Skywalker and set its own tone. At times, it does and the movie really feels exhilarating when that is the case. Other times I would just sort of accept what's going on and try to not be irritated that there are some moments that felt kind of thrown together last-minute instead of being carefully thought out and crafted. Still, none of that broke the movie for me. JJ Abrams definitely saved this trilogy of Star Wars and sends off the main story after 9 episodes with a fond farewell and what I can only assume is meant to be an absolute final movie. I don't expect there to be an Episode 10 (not succeeding the story of these now-9 episodes that is) but I wonder what might come after, if anything. That's another topic of discussion entirely but I like that this story is kind of wrapped up. I didn't enjoy some of the major narrative choices for The Last Jedi and felt the Force Awakens was overly simplistic in its major plot progression and lacked originality, so I had yet to be satisfied with anything from the new lineage of Star Wars movies (though I've enjoyed the spin-offs so far - Rogue One is excellent). That changed with Rise of Skywalker. I wasn't blown away but I am evidently much more satisfied with it than some of the haters that are trashing the User Score. It's a bit of a crowd-pleaser at times but I don't think most people will hate it for that. It could have been better but I don't know how much better it really could have been. A small handful of re-crafted scenes and perhaps a little less ""busy work"" for the characters which has them all over the place for the ~2.5 hours the movie runs might have gone a long way but, for me anyways, I didn't find the ""problems"" with the movie to be nearly as dramatic and ruinous as other have made them out to be. I think I really liked it but I know I didn't absolutely love it.",1
2149,"I watched this film twice now and probably by January 8, 2020, I will definitely watch it again. To be honest, I really enjoyed the film so much, that I kept on listening that original motion picture soundtrack and also watching The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi again, just to see its cohesiveness in the whole sequel trilogy and the Skywalker saga. I also bought the novelization for The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens, and will definitely but this film's novelization. I got hooked on Star Wars again as you can see.There was a lot of nostalgia and I pretty much didn't feel the fan service many critics and other fans were saying. I just focused on the whole story itself. At first viewing, I needed to digest all that's happened in the film, because there are a lot of things going on. But when I watched it again, it all makes sense now. And I pretty enjoyed indeed.This is not the best Star Wars movie nor the worst Star Wars movie. That's a guarantee. But for me, this ninth installment really wrapped up the whole Skywalker saga. The irony though is that the title is THE RISE OF SKYWALKER (referring to Rey, originally a Palpatine but decided to take the name that really helped her in her Jedi training and her entire life), but this is the end of the Skywalker saga. I'm pretty sure there will be more stories about Rey Skywalker and I am excited for that one.J.J. Abrams did a fantastic job in creating this emotional, breathtaking and epic conclusion to the franchise. A lot of jaw-dropping happenings, shocking revelations, awesome space battles and of course, the lightsaber duels are spot-on.Without a doubt, The Rise of Skywalker is a roller-coaster ride and will definitely watch it over and over again.I don't care about the mixed reviews on this. Abrams can't please anyone. I don't care if it opened at the box office domestically at $170 million dollars or something. This will hit a billion dollar mark and that's a guarantee. For me, this is a film to remember that will be passed on from this generation and to the future generations.",1
2150,"It was entertaining, yes it tried to readjust from where TLJ left the saga, but it was throughly entertaining. I don't read the books or lore so I enjoyed it and had fun with it. Is it perfect... no, is it a good watch... absolutely. Check it out, don't believe the negativity.",1
2151,"I'm aware that the critics haven't rated this very highly, but I truly believe it to be one of the best star wars movies yet. Considering the heap of issues it had to resolve from the last one, JJ did an excellent job at making an enjoyable storyline and keeping the whole thing entertaining. Whilst fast paced at times, this is more than understandable since they needed to redo half of the last movie too! I've spent almost the whole of the Disney franchise hating Kylo, and not in a good way. Sometimes there are villains you love to hate, Kylo wasn't one of these. I just hated him. And I've never switched my opinion on a character so fast that in this movie. It wasn't even down to the twist that happens, I loved him from the start. From an annoying character, JJ has made a genuinely sympathetic and confused guy. Loved it!",1
2152,"The final chapter of the Skywalker saga, the Resistance facing the First Order once more in an epic battle of good versus evil. As always this is a spoiler free review, rest assured there are no plot details but if you are a die-hard Star Wars fan what are you doing reading this? Go see the film.The Rise of Skywalker is well and truly for the fans, and if you can criticise it for at least one thing it might actually be paying too much fan service. But do I care? No, I was too busy enjoying myself. It’s not perfect but it’s entertaining, emotional and has some show stealing performances. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver together carried The Rise of Skywalker. I loved absolutely everything about them, the focus is very much on them and this films gives the opportunity to show us just what they're capable of as Rey and Kylo Ren. You also have everything else expected with a Star Wars movie, spectacular visual effects and the iconic John Williams soundtrack. It ties up as many loose ends as it can, it has a real sense of closure and will hit you with a lot of nostalgia. Perhaps J.J. Abrams was being a little overly ambitious with The Rise of Skywalker, the pacing for much of this film wasn’t great if I’m honest. A lot of scenes seemed to be cut short and I found myself wanting a lot more. There is a lot jam-packed into it and certain scenes suffer as a result. This also creates a problem with underused characters along with a huge amount of cameos. I’m not saying I wasn’t on board with this but again it all felt like a desperate attempt to get back on good terms with the angry fans. By giving certain characters little to no screen time but stuffing in an unnecessary amount of cameos felt cheap and honestly wasn't needed. The Force Awakens gave us some much needed new blood to the Star Wars franchise, The Last Jedi expanded on this and was a lot more ambitious. I was a little disappointed to see The Rise of Skywalker abandon this but I'll just have to get over it. Say what you want about The Last Jedi but it took a lot more risks compared to The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker. They both feel very safe and by the book but in it's defense it kept me entertained. I personally love all three movies in this new trilogy but some people feel completely differently. And then there are some mad bastards who'll defend the dreaded prequels, we all have a preference and by trying too hard to please everyone you may end up pleasing no one. Not everyone is loving it but the only way you'll know for sure is if you see it for yourself.After the controversial response to Rian Johnson’s take on Star Wars it really feels like J.J Abrams was doing some damage control and trying to win over all those pissed off fans and what is the result? More pissed off fans, no matter what, you can’t please everyone and if you don’t like The Rise of Skywalker, fine. Good for you for having an opinion but don’t attack someone else for liking it. I loved it and many others feel the same. It’s nice to be able to enjoy a Star Wars film because aside from this new trilogy I haven’t enjoyed a Star Wars film since the original movies so yes I enjoyed every minute of The Rise of Skywalker, it puts a nice definitive ending to the story and I’ll no doubt see it again. Highly recommended for all the Star Wars fans.",1
2153,I loved it and thought it had action fromthe beginning. Beautiful visuals and fun cameos.,1
2162,"All you need to know is it's 100X better than, ""THAT WHICH MUST NOT BE NAMED""! JJ actually brings back the ""feel"" of Star Wars, which was an insurmountable job after ""YOU KNOW WHAT!"" BEST acting goes to: C-3PO!! He's BACK to the ""old"" C-3PO we had in the ""original"" trilogy! Episode 9 could have been 2 films, but I think Disney wanted to move on from this disaster of a trilogy (lack of planning & cohesive story ruined it from the beginning) so it packed it all in 2 1/2 hours! Overall, I was satisfied from where I was 2 years ago. If you're a Star Wars fan, go see it for yourself!Saving Grace: ""The Mandalorian"" Season 2!!",1
2166,"I honestly really enjoyed this movie, Rey felt less like a Mary Sue, Ben was the best character overall and they made one of my new favorite characters, general Enric Pryde. What I didn't like however was the fact that the Knights of Ren was barely used and they felt more like this movie's attempt at Boba Fett, also the ridiculous fast pacing. However other than those things, I really enjoyed this movie. Great job JJ.",1
2167,"It's amazing movie and great close at Skywalker arc after all. I guess that Disney did the best for the story like the star wars deserved. In fact, the original 3 movies of star wars (a new hope, empire strikes back and return of jedi) was a garbage that growed 'cause the special effects was a big deal at this time.I was born in '85 and (until the phantom menace, the clone wars and revenge of the sith)star wars was a good movie, nothing special.Anyway, this final arc was great ending with great actors. If I could remove any thing of this movie I was removs the kilo'n rey kiss scene.",1
2168,"It's a great movie, that doesn't deserve the hate is getting, tried to fix last jedi nonsense as much as it could while incorporating Leia, great effort, satisfied with it! not perfect but def enjoyable!",1
2169,"After The Last Jedi, I knew that this movie would draw criticism no matter what direction it took. I feel that this is about as ""Star Wars-y"" a movie can possibly be. Is it executed perfectly? No. Is it a good, fun, popcorn flick? ABSOLUTELY. I see other reviewers state that Disney has turned SW into a series of kid's movies...I guess they never got the memo that Star Wars has ALWAYS been kid's movies.",1
2170,"Better than the 2 previous one, but still a mediocre movie, some parts of this movie, doesn't make any sense, but other parts are good, at least we get an ending to this epic saga, the problem here is that Disney ruined Star Wars so much that I would rather watch episode 1 than this new trilogy",1
2171,"I'd give it an 8 but there are so many people giving it 0s and 1s that we must somehow counterbalance it. Very underrated film. It is flawed, yes, but it's still a good Star Wars story that manages to wrap up the entire saga in a way that feels meaningful and not unnecessary (as the sequel trilogy felt before tRoS came out, imo of course). It is very fast paced, and it should be longer, but this isn't that big of a problem for me.",1
2172,"Decent movie.  It does seem like 2 movies in one and tries to accomplish it all in under 2.5 hours.  Lots of fan service, which is to be expected in movie 9 of a 9 movie saga.  Thankfully JJ understands the saga is about Skywalkers and actually brings closure to their story.  Over all a fun movie.  Would have loved to see the full tilogy done by JJ.  But he did the best he could with the mess he inherited.",1
2174,Better than phantom menace!!! Has good acting and great story. I loved it so much,1
2175,At least we have The Mandalorian The worst structure in a Star Wars movieThe worst ending of an important trilogy as Star Wars is,0
2176,"I'm saddened to see all the critics bashing TROS. Especially the ""Fans"" that give this a 0/10 and haven't even seen it just because they hated the Last Jedi or it didn't do EXACTLY what they wanted. This is a good movie, it's fun, funny, sad and epic.If you like Star wars because it takes you to a different Galaxy where  you get to watch good vs evil, then you should definitely check this movie out.",1
2177,"I think what was done in Star Wars the Last Jedi really compromised this movie to be what it was. The main **** in the eighth movie was to kill Snoke, because if we to compare Snoke  was the Palatine of the original trilogy and Kylo Ren was the Darth Vader, meaning it was as if in the second film the Palpatine would be dead. This brought a tremendous challenge for JJ in this new star wars, he had to have someone bigger than Kylo and his solution was to put Palpatine in again, but JJ didn't have much time to explain everything, he tried to correct the **** done in the eighth movie. This movie didn't have the time needed to do something that would need to be done, to explain everything would take 3, 4 hours and the movie had just 2 and a half hours. In the midst of this complexity I think JJ did a good job and the movie shouldn't be getting all this bad review, for me this movie is 8. I'm sorry about my English.",1
2178,Great movie. Epic epic ending. I Still give it 10/10 despite occasional corny bits at 1st. But epic great movie.I don't understand the mixed reviews. I find great movies aren't appreciated and mediocrity is celebrated.For reference these r the movies I love: 1st matrix movie/1st hobbit movie/independence day/world war z / interstellar   ---Mediocre movies:Gravity   ----Terrible movies:Ready player 1 / mortal engines,1
2179,Achei muito legal o filme so que como um fa de star wars eu n gostei q não teve uma incrivel batalha area do final odiei que a rey seria a neta do palpatine e que no final ela beija. O kylo ren me deu vontade de morrer quando eu vi essa cena eu queria que ela tivesse matado o kylo ren na cena em ela apunhala ele com o proprio sabre fe luz e eu sei que algumas pessoas vão falar que sem o kylo ren ela morreria isso é mentira então essa é a minha critica eu gostei do filme em si tirando essas cenas,1
2180,Rey kills her grandfather that is evil and she turns into a full Jedi after that she went to the planet were she was kidnapped from her parents then this lady asked who are you Rey said “I am Rey Skywalker”,1
2181,"Much Like Kylo Ren rebuilding his mask in the beginning of the movie, J.J. Abrams pieces together the fragments of his original vision for this trilogy after it was shattered when Rian Johnson was given control over the middle chapter. And like that rebuilt mask it's cool to look at, but the cracks are visible and it isn't the most fulfilling thing to see return.Largely because it once again feels derivative of the original trilogy. Remember how the final battle in The Force Awakens was basically the same as A New Hope's, only bigger? Well the climatic showdown here closely resembles the one found in Return of the Jedi. Only bigger. The whole film is largely comprised of scenes, moments, and a plot that mirrors those that came before, with a few concessions having been made for the things that happened in The Last Jedi that Abrams obviously didn't plan on.I guess I shouldn't be too surprised though. Abrams' film career has largely been defined by nostalgia. Even his only work on the silver screen to not be tied to a preexisting franchise is a throwback to Spielbergian science-fiction thrillers from the '80s. It's all the man has really proven himself capable of offering.Well, that and exciting setpieces with gorgeous visuals. The action sequences are thrilling and there's a lot of great scenery. The new planets visited are memorable and I loved all the creative new aliens species encountered over the course of the movie that made the former action-figure collector in me drool.As to why I find Rise of Skywalker's emulative nature so problematic whereas I didn't in The Force Awakens, it really comes down to two reasons. The first being that these young heroes didn't live up to the ones they were intended to follow in the footsteps of. BB-8's presence dropped off after the first film, Finn's most defining character trait was his one-track mind obsession with Rey, and this is the first time Poe actually felt like one of the main three protagonists after largely being sidelined for the majority of this trilogy and being little more than an ornery screw up whenever he was onscreen (why Leia wanted him as the resistance's replacement general I'll never know).The second being because of The Last Jedi. When Rian Johnson took the reins for that entry this trilogy became the confused brainchild of two people with very different intentions. As a result we are left with an overarching story that feels disjointed and at odds with itself. Rise of Skywalker being the concluding chapter bears the brunt of this conflict and comes up short at establishing cohesion. Instead choosing to ignore its most direct predecessor as much as possible.All is not lost though. The film has a saving grace in Kylo and Ren. The culmination of their shared journey is sweet even if neither end up in the most satisfying position. Watching them both struggle with the darkness inside them and develop such a unique bond has been incredibly compelling and any moment where they are onscreen together is lightning.I'm also not going to sit here and act like I didn't find the whole thing entertaining. Abrams packed this with so much spectacle I found it impossible to take my eyes off the screen even if a lot of it felt like déjà vu. That being said I am glad to see this trilogy finally come to an end. Abrams' resurrection of the Skywalker family certainly had its moments and I did have fun, but at the same time I don't see how his story did anything for them that the OT didn't.",1
2182,Great movie with good visuals and sound. And a great end tot a long lasting story. Sometimes the story moves on to fast but I think that is because they have to tie all the ropes together in 1 movie.Maybe if they would have split this movie over 2 movies (like,1
2183,Laddies and Gentlemen. George Lucas' masterpiece has been ruined. With the laziest and most predictable movie I have ever seen. Leia's death is the laziest writing I have ever seen and Rey's overall character developement is non exsistant. Save your money. Go watch something else at the cinema. Awful. So turns out that Annakin wasn't the chosen one. Screw this triology!,0
2184,"Una Película que quizás le decepcionó a la crítica, en lo personal me gustó, pero no es de las mejores de la saga, pero si la mejor desde que Disney compro la marca. Tiene escenas buenas como en todo episodio, y un final ""adecuado"".",1
2185,+ A lots of action+ Nice visual effect+ Nice actors+ the final is amazing- Story is not interresting,1
2186,It is not as bad as people say it is! It feels like an ok closure to an average story. Feels like it was better than Star Wars 7 or 8.,1
2187,"J J Abrams gives us a new movie with very good soundtracks, visual effects but he didn't give to the fans all that they wanted to this final chapterKylo Ren and Rey are basically the only good character in the sequel trilogy with, maybe, Poe Dameron and Finn.",1
2188,It's a great movie! By far the best of the trilogy.The end is a little disappointing but quickly forgotten by the intensity of the preceding scenes.the acting is really good.,1
2189,"I really loved it, such a great movie. Easily the best of the sequel trilogy and definitely one of the best in the franchise. JJ really did a good job at righting the mistakes and misery that was ""the last jedi."" Almost an impossible feat.Thus proving yet again that he knows what he's doing, and that he cares about the fans, by several times paying homage to fans of the original trilogy. All an all, a great conclusion to a much beloved saga.",1
2190,"This film... is really good. For me, for me, the third best movie in the star wars series.",1
2191,"Film Review:Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.I was eighteen years old in the early summer of 1977 when Star Wars dropped like a cannonball into our laps. Both of my parents were still alive, and my brother’s mental illness had not yet shattered our family and sent my father to his early grave. As a group, we’d watched the last episode of Gunsmoke just two years prior, my Dad’s favorite show hands-down for most of its run, only falling off during those jaded Watergate years and our final disillusion with the Vietnam War. Then, suddenly, Star Wars arrived unannounced with its clear water morality—love not hate, courage over fear, loyalty to friends and common cause, and an appeal for simple faith in the universal connected-ness of all things. It felt childlike beside that era’s gritty, American cinema verité films like Chinatown (1974), Dog Day Afternoon (1975) and Report to the Commissioner (1975). But, oh, how strong that simple appeal! In Star Wars, we found classic characters bound in common struggle against evil at high odds. The Kid, the rogue with the heart-a-gold, the princess—and we reveled in their unlikely success as they did, reassured that faith, courage, loyalty, and a little luck will stand against evil even at terrible odds. Still, Star Wars felt like a simple, rousing tale, but for The Empire Strikes Back (1980), which grounded the Force in family. All at once, my father’s disappointment came clear, as did my resentment and confusion over my new role as the family’s savior in the aftermath of my brother’s affliction, a brother whose every step I followed like a trail blazed through adolescence. The tears I saw flowing on my father’s face bewildered, and the things I shouted over my shoulder, and he at me, stung, as I stormed out unaware that I would never see him again.With The Rise of Skywalker, director J.J. Abrams understands one thing, clearly: forty years have passed since an American generation of young people marveled at those early Star Wars films. He knows that those young people have grown into middle age and that many have confronted life’s hard equations: that you cannot go back, that some opportunities never recur, and that you cannot unspeak harsh words you have said to those who have died. The Rise of Skywalker’s plot may feel derivative, its conventions rehashed, and its refusal to realize the story lines set out in The Last Jedi (2017) frustrating, but such things are small beer. They barely register next to Princess Leia’s final connection to, and Han Solo’s recovery of, their lost son; Ben’s reawakening to the love within him, and Rey’s final thrust to set things right while all the Jedi speak within her. For those of us who cannot stand beside the ‘force ghosts’ of our dead mothers and fathers and brothers, in conversation, and speak the loving truths we wish we could, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker rings our bell. J.J. Abrams knows well the film he has made for us, bless his heart.    Michael D. Phillips",1
2192,Amazing film to finish the saga Kylo finally becomes an awesome character as well.,1
2193,"Might not be the best Star Wars movie but it provides a really good ending, which is the most important. Great acting to from Driver and Ridley.",1
2194,This movie is great but bringing Palpatine was not a good idea because Anakin end the sith and bringing him back like that is like bringing back the sith,1
2195,"The film is average, it is not the best, nor the worst. Rey being a palpatine destroys a beautiful message from the last jedi left, that you don't have to be a strong family in strength to be someone. hug from Brazil.",1
2196,"Very enjoyable. Solid plot, lots of fun action, cool twists and turns. Wraps up the saga fairly well.",1
2197,The film has some problems but overall it ends the saga in a very beautiful way.,1
2198,"The movie has MacGuffin, things when you say ""what the **** did the writers do here?""; so it's no perfect, but it's a good movie that close 9 movies and 42 years. May the force be with you.",1
2199,"This movie is not one of the best Star Wars movies, but I think it is not one of the worst. The successes of the film:The fanservice is not bad, the special effects are great, the photography is good, the emotive moments are really sad, some moments are quite epic, the movie shows the real power of the force...Now, the mistakes of the film:The first act of the movie is quite boring, everything about the C3-PO plot is really bad, the movie is really short and they don’t explain any situation.",1
2200,This movie is good but not great or terrible and yes there are some stupid scenes like the space horses but if you say that the prequels are better than this alright movie than well your lost I'm sorry but your probably an angry reylo fan or just a squeal hater and really they did have only like a year to make this so that's why it probably felt rushed,1
2201,Best movie ever!!!!!!!!!! Awesome SFX thanks to James earl jones and Harrison Ford,1
2202,"Much better than I expected.  I fund little to smile about in the earlier two films, some things to smile about in Ron Howard's Solo film.  This film is an outstanding, incredible achievement of imagination and craft.  I suspect this is JJ's best film and best script, with his several collaborators.  The light saber fight choreography has never been better ever.  The acting has never been better.  What I don't see mentioned in other reviews is the video-game angle.  The Rogue One movie played more like a video game than like a movie, lots to do, not much emotional engagement.  Rise of Skywalker plays as a perfect hybrid of movie and video game, best elements of both, lots you culd do in a video-game AND lots of emotional engagement, even some originality (Luke and Leia) were bother sister.  Rei and Ben become brother and sister).  I think more credit needs to go to the brain trust of writers, including Colin Treverow and JJ, two masters of breathing fresh life into old IPs, sometimes strikingly original new life.  The trailers suggested the movie could be overly sentimental fan service, a ""Star Wars greatest hits.""  Every Disney Star Wars has tried to be ""Star Wars greatest hits.""  I found the story engaging over and above the hundreds of ""greatest hits"" moments.  Quite an accomplishment.  :)",1
2203,It was an awesome film ! The Sequel Trilogy > the Prequel Trilogy ! The Original Trilogy is still the best though.,1
2204,"Pros: -Fantastic score, as per usual with Star Wars.-Great performances from all the actors, particularly Ian McDiarmid.-Rey being Palpatine’s granddaughter, while I can understand why it’s disappointing to some, I feel is a really cool twist that I didn't see coming.-The film has really great visuals and great action.-Tons of fanservice that’s sure to please hardcore Star Wars fans.-I am forever grateful to J.J. Abrams for making Rose’s role in this movie nothing more than a cameo appearance. While I don’t have anything against Kelly Marie Tran, Rose was just a boring, irritating character in The Last Jedi and I was praying she wouldn’t be heavily involved in The Rise of Skywalker. -They did a great job integrating Leia into the film. It really does feel like Carrie Fisher was there on the set when they were filming. Massive props to the production teams for pulling that off.-Hearing all the voice’s of Jedi’s past, while I do still wish we could have seen their actual ghosts, is really cool, and even just hearing the voices of characters like Kanan and Ahsoka from the cartoons in one of the films is so freaking awesome. Cons: -The pacing is a bit too fast and it can be hard to keep up at times.-Parts of the script feel a bit too fan-fictiony. -Why does Palpatine order Ben to try and kill Rey if his plan is to have her take on the title of empress? It just seems like an odd choice. -Some of the new characters like Zorii Bliss and Jannah seem interesting but aren’t very fleshed out. -There are some plot lines that they introduce but then just don't go anywhere with them. For example, they reveal that Hux is the mole in the First Order feeding info to the rebels, but then kill him off shortly after, and later on they hint at Finn being force sensitive, but then don’t really go anywhere with that plot line.-Certain arcs feel a bit rushed, like Rey’s existential crisis she goes through when she realizes she’s a Palpatine and Poe’s doubting he can lead the Resistance after Leia dies. -While seeing all those ships come together to take on the final order is cool to see, it does lead one to question where all these people were when the Resistance sent out a distress signal in The Last Jedi.-They don’t really explain Darth Sidious’s return all too well in the film itself. -Sidious’ return can, and has, been interpreted as making Anakin Skywalker’s sacrifice in Return of the Jedi pointless. I feel if they just added a line saying something along the lines of that each generation has a different chosen one and that Anakin was the chosen one of his generation while Rey is the chosen one of her generation, then that would have cleared things up. -While the, “I AM ALL THE SITH!”, and, “I am all the Jedi.”, lines are pretty  awesome, it definitely does feel like the writers were trying a little too hard to copy Endgame.Final Verdict: Overall, I think The Rise of Skywalker is a good movie, but similarly to the Last Jedi, it’s got some pretty noteworthy flaws that can drag things down a bit. The pacing is a bit too fast, even for a J.J. Abrams film, and some plot lines are either rushed or don’t really go anywhere. This movie really could have benefitted from an extra 30-40 minutes in it’s runtime. Still, it’s a solid conclusion to the Skywalker saga that should satisfy most fans. 7/10",1
2205,"My preferred Star Wars, more powerful characters, beautiful love story.I understand that the fans do not like because it goes beyond their principles and pushes the rules, but he is ambitious, and perfectly consistent with the old film.",1
2206,"Great visuals and sound design, Kylo Ren - great character, but it feels too rushed.",1
2207,"The pacing and beat of the movie es horrible,a complete fan service story line with a couple of good scenes. Colin Trevorrow's script had been much better to see in the cinema than this one version made for please the fandom menace... Only the VFXs are excellent as always thanks to ILM.",1
2208,"Don't believe the backlash. This is a fast paced, fun and ultimately fulfilling final chapter in the latest cycle of Star Wars movies. It could have benefited by being split into two films, giving it some breathing room. However, as it was it gave us a fine conclusion for Kylo and Rey.",1
2209,It just makes you feel good and joyful.Has a happy ending and give a good message.,1
2210,"The movie is really good and with some funny jokes, but the end of the movie wasn't so good",1
2212,For me it was a very good final chapter and ending to a life long story.I loved it!,1
2214,"As Star Wars as Star Wars gets.  If you didn't enjoy this film as one of the best in the SAGA, what the Hell did you want?  By the time you get to the ninth in any series, expectations will never be met.  You won't please everyone, but I enjoyed every single second of this film.  Fantastic acting, editing, story, effects, and it was incredibly meaningful and emotional!",1
2215,"Completely underrated movie. When fans are given what they want, they complain! Besides that, an emotonal end to the most beloved saga of all times, loaded of great action sequences and turning points.",1
2216,Watched the 3 Disney movies with my gf. Both of us enjoyed them. I think there is a vocal minority that will never be happy with any new Star Wars movies. The old actors are dying or dead. I loved the quirky alien characters and droids. The final fight was awesome.,1
2217,"It’s crazy that people can nitpick the accuracy of the use of the force and ignore the ridiculous science used in Star Wars. Let’s face it, Star Wars isn’t science fiction, it’s fantasy in space. I grew up a huge Star Wars fan but I don’t make them out to be more than what they are. That being said it was a decent to good movie with a lot of mcguffins and it goes full deus ex machina, just like every other Star Wars. I really give it a 7.5. But i’m going to round up because of the ridiculous hate towards it.",1
2218,I enjoyed this movie. There were moments that I laughed and others that I was on the edge of my seat. I enjoyed the chemistry between Kylo Ren and Rey. All in all I felt entertained which is the way you should feel at a movie. I actually saw it more than one time.,1
2219,"One of my favorite movies in life, and I don't know why people It's a bad movie.",1
2220,"At 39, this film made me a very happy boy.  It had everything I could have wanted in a Star Wars film, and then some.  It's so much better on repeat viewings.  I'm not ashamed to say that I cried.  I was very satisfied.  What seemed too much to comprehend on first viewing comes across as much more measured and balanced the second time around.  Of course, you have to suspend disbelief, but you shouldn't take it too seriously, anyway.  It's only a Star Wars film.  If anything, I would have liked to have seen more of the Rose Tico character.  I was pleased that the lesbian kiss was included.  It might have been a very small gesture, but it's a step in the right direction and is promsing for the expanded universe.  For the record, I personally liked The Last Jedi and am pleased overall with the final trilogy.  This final iteration made me want to watch the whole saga all over again for the overall story arc, even the first three (I actually didn't mind the third one).  I know there are a lot of impassioned people out there, as they have a strong emotional investment in the storyline, and some people are very precious about their sci-fi mythos, but were the films ever really anything more than swashbuckling popcorn movies?  I can't believe there is so much hate for this movie.  I think people take the work that goes into movies of this calibre for granted - a lot of hard of work and dedication has gone into this and clearly they care about this universe.  I think it's an incredible achievement and the cast and crew should be congratulated for a fitting end to it all.  Babu Frik rocks!  Thanks, J.J.",1
2221,"Un film con grossi difetti, principalmente dovuti al tentativo (sbagliato?) di ""rimediare"" all'opera destrutturante di episodio 8. Detto questo il film mi è piaciuto, forse grazie alle scarse aspettative residue che avevo dopo la morte di Snoke e per questo per me merita un voto alto.",1
2222,Although a bit uneven with a lack of imagination and development. Star Wars: The Rise ofSkywalker concludes this convoluted sequel trilogy and the intriguing Reylo dynamic as best as possible with an emotionally driven ending that answers are most important questions and makes good effort in redeeming Luke Skywalker.,1
2223,"I didn't go into this expecting much. I didn't much care for The Force Awakens, or The Last Jedi, and I was kind of ""meh"" about Rogue One which everyone else seemed to adore.But I absolutely loved Episode 9 :). Yes there was plenty in there and maybe some of it was a bit thrown together and the pacing was fast but I adored every minute of it.I've always thought that Kylo Ren was a bit like a teenager on the bus with his music on too loud who I would have no qualms about going up to and telling him to turn it down. He just never gave me the feeling a Star Wars villain should, but I think in this film he really came of age and he seemed like he was playing the character he meant to.Most of all though, we had our real villain back who I can take seriously. Maybe it's just nostalgia cutting through and giving me the warm fuzzies (although as I say, I didn't like Episode 7 or 8 much) but this film gave me all the feels a Star Wars film should, and it felt like it was a beautiful and fitting end.",1
2224,This movie is one of my favorite movies I have seen! I saw this in the movie theatre and man did I love it. I think this movie deserves better reviews.,1
2225,"Мне понравилась эта часть больше, чем прошлая. Хотя и сюжет не такой, как многие фанаты ожидали, и в самом сюжете осталось много дыр.",1
2226,One of the beeeeeeeeesssssst starwars i have ever seenI realy enjoyed that,1
2227,"I think people want to hate the final movie a little too badly. There’s now a segment of the fan base going in subconsciously and sometimes consciously scanning the entire film for what they screwed up. It’s Disney’s problem that they disappointed us in some of the prior movies, it’s now our fault if we stroll in with this degree of confirmation bias. I think over time people will discover what a monumental accomplishment it was to tie all of this together without over doing it even more. This movie crams in an incredible amount and in our opinion is better than every episode except episode 4-6. It’s dense and rushed, but it’s fun. There’s a lot buried in here to enjoy in future viewing or an extended edition that gives it more time, which will be pretty cool.",1
2278,"A satisfying end to the Saga we all love, but we all love it from a different reason.Abrams bought us a satisfying and somewhat lovely ending, but as Luke said “No one’s ever really gone”, if you did not like it then don't accept it as the ending of the Star Wars, but you shouldn't hate it just becuase it is new. It does not matter that you loved the original trilogy, or the prequels, or the new one, there is one common in everyone, we all LOVE Star Wars.",1
2310,"Stunning visually, great acting and a satisfying end to the trilogy. Yes there are some problems. It's not perfect, but no movie is.",1
2312,"(I apologize in advence for some mistakes I may make, english is not my first language, so sorry.) This movie is honestly a lot better then I thought it would be. While the first 2 movies made Rey's developtment a little weird and hard to notice, this movie makes it obvious that it's her journey and I love it for that. Rey in this movie is not perfect, she struggles, she is impuslive, careless at times (she almost killed chewie) and she thinks for the most part it's her blood that will turn her into the very thing she fears the most. Now, Kylo. When you first watch it you will wonder how Kylo will turn good since the movie's name is The Rise of Skywalker and Kylo is the last Skywalker. And it makes so much sense, in that scene where Han speaks to him it's not really Han but his guilt towards killing Han that changed him and proved him wrong on his logic ""kill it if you have to"" because killing will not make you go past it in fact it will haunt you, but it can be for the better.The movie is not perfect though, for example what the hell was the thing with the knife ? Couldn't they have just found something else like a tracker to find the artifact or something like this ? But honestly that is just a few things that didn't ruin the movie as a whole. Now the most contreversial part of the movie: Palpatine. He is great. His inclusion made sense for explaining why Rey was so powerful, even if I'm not a fan of ""you can pnly use the Force because of lineage"" but it also gives an intersting moral of ""blood doesn't define who you are"" with Rey overcoming the biggest threat of the whole galaxy and embodiment of all the siths which she was supposed to become. Now something that seemed weird but makes sense, why does Palpatine have thousands of planet busting ships ? Well improving techonoly and also he has been hiding in the shadows for another 30 years ! He was definitly preparing something. Now on to the more superficial stuff like the music the visuals the fights etc. All are great, the music may not be totally original but it's inclusion in certain precise scenes makes those scenes much more impactful. The visuals are also great with great shots, colors, and places that I wish I could know more about. The fight scenes are very good, you can see Rey's impulsiveness which makes her weak against Kylo, those scenes are not here nor are they too perfect like in the prequels, those fights feel real. Overall great characters, great story, great moral at the end, of course it's no even close to the original trilogy but it's a very good movie that could've made the sequel trilogy bad in the end.",1
2313,"It is a worthy completion of the saga. The actors played well, but not disgusting. The entire film follows the dynamics, a slightly confusing plot. A bit of propaganda that we are all even, cute kisses at the end of the film between the girls, the resistance pilots. May neocommunism and world peace come. The action on the spot in some places ran a goosebump on what’s on the screen. Almost like in the good old days. The episode is far from a failure, as many toxic users think. Daisy Ridley in the role of Rey, who in the beginning builds herself up as an unworthy really great Jedi. A steeper villain than Adam Driver aka Kylo Ren must still be sought. Each actor gave his best to my personal opinion. The rebels and the Imperials smash each other for too long. I am glad that they are leaving for a hell.",1

2324,"If the plot of this movie was a three piece, it could possibly have become something. But as a single movie save for Rian Johnsons disastrous destruction of the whole franchises future, it does not do the job. The pace of the movie is at such a speed that there is impossible to become invested in anything. You leave with a bad taste in your mouth.",0

2332,"This movie feels like the director tried to fit in as much stuff as possible, and in the process of doing so created a movie that takes the audience's understanding of Star Wars, puts it into a truck and backs it into a river. It hurts my brain to even dwell on this movie as half of the actions the characters take make no sense whatsoever. Speaking of characters, they are terrible. There is no development at all. Rey is the most bland, boring and uninspired character I've ever seen in such a high budget movie. Several plot  threads are discontinued or straight-up ignored, leaving the audience to wonder if they missed something. No, the problem isn't with the audience, it's with the movie. The end of the movie is extremely unsatisfying and does not feel earned by any of the characters. Most of the time, the characters in this movie feel like they are acting the way the script needs them to act, and not how they would actually act given the circumstances. The villain brought into this last movie, alongside several other things from the Original Trilogy, feels fake and a cheap attempt at inducing nolstagia from the viewers. Overall, Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker fails on so many levels it is legitimately difficult for me to describe it here within the character limit. On the grand scale of things, when considering this movie together with The Last Jedi and Force Awakens, the trilogy is a mess. As I mentioned before, many plot points are discontinued for no reason, while others are disappointing, such as the Knights of Ren. There are numerous moments within this movie where I was questioning if I was actually watching a Star Wars movie, and not some fan-fiction I'd find on Youtube. The only saving grace of this movie is, possibly, it's ""fun"" action scenes, which I can definitely see entertaining the more casual audience, as was the case with my family, which is the reason I gave this movie 3 and not 0.",0

2334,"too much of the movie relys on call backs to previous movies of star wars instead of focusing on having its own story to tell. reliance on previously better written characters just to get buts in the seats to sell tickets is a pretty cheap way of tugging at the heart strings of customers who were fans of this for decades. the cgi at times while have some good moments was way over done and will likely age very poorly in upcoming years. lot of the acting was either wooden or stilted at best. the stakes the characters had to face were done way overboard serving as more cool visuals to add while having nothing of importance. apparently the emperor being back as the main threat to the story instead of kylo ren says enough bout the universe and worldbuilding. his character is now pointless. rey being established as palpatine but in the last movie being declared nothing. kylos motivation and existence over the course of the trilogy flip flops everywhere without a clear sign of what his goals are. attempts to fix what the last jedi are blatant obvious here and they arent better but worse. CGI leia was not a wise move to keep her around and is made worse out of deconstructing her character last movie. if anything having her gone from the story probably wouldve done best instead of trying to keep her around for much longer. reverting luke back to himself here to counter what rian did doesnt really matter too much now cause of how is character is looked at now. chewy as now is barely a character like R2 and lando who only served small roles in the story and werent able too do much. certain characters were in this played no parts and were easily forgotten. its obvious disney had no blueprint on what this trilogy was gonna be and know where it was gonna go from the start. comes of more like a custody battle over the ownership with jj's cancelation of the last jedi. while rian canceled jjs universe from TFA. overall the trilogy is a huge mess lacking anything of quality. if anything this sequel trilogy down the road will be used to show what happens when you let untalented people have control over your work just to try to turn a profit. if anything its just bad movie with nothing really to say or enjoy. its just hollow, soulless, devoid of emotions put out by a corporation that has no more ideas on how to entertain its audience anymore",0

2337,"Honestly, what was Disney thinking putting Kathleen Kennedy in charge? The Rise of Skywalker is filled with plot holes and inconsistencies. It honestly just defecates all over what the Star Wars universe has built up since A New Hope was released. This is a travesty beyond the likes of Game of Thrones season 8, and will go down in history as the worst film in the franchise (next to The Last Jedi).",0
2338,"This movie is dumb and made as a die ha rd star wars fan angry and **** sad. J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson thanks a lot for ruining star wars. For example, there is a **** scene where Rey and Ren fight each other like **** kids and oops rey accidentally uses here force and kills chewbacca, even tho she is shown to be a **** powerful Jedi with very little training. It's **** stupid.",0
2339,The retconning from Abrams sadly is too little too late. This should’ve been st least a two part finale like Harry Potter or Panem did. But on the other hand there is nothing good about this movie I wanted to see more from so whatever. This movie series should’ve been the final trilogy of cinemas most historical franchise and it turned out to be..nothing. De-canonice please.,0
2340,An overall good movie excellent Saturday night in movie.... But as a star wars movie lacks substance. Pacing would have benefitted from the movie being cut in two parts. Then perhaps it wouldn't have needed to rely on novels to fill the gaps in story. john boyega needed more screen time and a better story. needed the fan service to be toned down 7/10. May the force be with you. Disney needs to up the game with better story for its characters.,1
2342,"a bunch of random ideas thrown in a huge narrative mess, without even thinking about what film they were screenweriting for. this has nothing to do with star wars, nor with basic good movie story writing. an absolute disaster. go watch a random action movie on netflix instead of wasting time on this abomination.do not, i repeat DO NOT watch it",0
