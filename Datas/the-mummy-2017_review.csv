4,"Overall I thought The Mummy was an entertaining film. It seemed to have the right amount of action, jump scares, and humor. My 14 and 16-year-old kids liked it more than I did.",1
5,"The buried ancient egypt sets were very good and the mummy chick was aggressive and strong. You can imagine all Tom cruise movies are like, so you can expect this mummy movie to be like that. I still like the classic mummy 1 and 2 in the past. Maybe this one is the sequel of the mummy series?",1
6,"I am more surprised from the high scores some people rate this movie, than from the actualy movie. Horrible. So pathetic i don't want to comment. Don't waste your time and go watch the original from 1999.",0
7,Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe are two of my favourite actors and while this movie wasn’t Shakespeare I found it very good as entertainment just as much as any Marvel or DC production. The fantasy plot was good? It felt a  little Raiders of the Lost Arkie going on. Brillant stunts .Tom C does his own. Great CGI? Attractive actors. Some people just don’t like Tom Cruise and you can’t legislate for that. Good movie. Worth the ticket,1
9,"Unfocused, underdeveloped, and uninspired are the three U's that ruin Universal's fourth (Yes, I said FOURTH) attempt at building a shared universe for their library of monsters. I thought that this would be terrible from the trailers, but I had a soft spot of hope, simply so that Universal could take advantage of the Dark Universe's potential. I was dead wrong.The Mummy seems more interested at brushing away any sort of character or build-up for action and foreshadowing (of the DU, of course), than telling a good story. The first 20 minutes aren't great, but they do establish the plot, characters, and initial tone (a bit more serious than before, but not afraid of having fun). Then it all goes down as the film moves along. The tone becomes inconsistent, shifting from scary and serious to silly and comedic at inappropriate moments; the moments themselves are cheap, with jump-scare style horror, and lame slapstick. The pacing dashes by way too fast, not giving enough time for anything in the film to settle. The characters, particularly Tom Cruise's, have no arc or development, not even any chemistry between him and Annabelle Wallis to liven the film up. Ahmanet is just as dull as anyone else, having very little charm or depth for us to be frightened or to care of her. A good portion of the film is dedicated to Dr. Jekyll and his research facility, Prodigium, yet the film breezes through those (actually interesting) ideas so fast that here's little reason to have them in the film.The whole feature is a mess, deciding that being a  $125 million promotional piece for the Dark Universe was more important than being a good movie. What an absolute waste of potential.",0
10,"A boring, uninspired start to Universal's ""Dark Universe"" of monster films, The Mummy comes off as incredibly lazy, with its poorly edited action, lack of direction, and uneven performances - and even Tom Cruise's running can't save it from its inevitable downfall.",0
11,"The Mummy (2017) is by no means an excellent movie, and it's never intended to be so. It's a OK enough summer popcorn flick with plenty of explosions, actions, and Tom Cruise running. It might come as cheesy at some points, and the plot's somewhat messy, but this is what I was expecting, a dumb, fun, loud, cheesy movie. If you walk in to the cinema expecting more than that, you'll walk out being furious to the makers of this movie. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. On the other hand, the advertising clearly took a wrong direction by selling it as a franchise-starter. Studios need realize and wake up that you can't just make a movie to start a Marvel-ish dynasty. If they want to start a universe, just let it flow, don't rush it! DCEU fell to that pit with its earlier movies (Thanks to Wonder-Woman, people might actually start to get interested in that universe). Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them also barely dodged the bullet (Thankfully, the fan base of the Wizarding World was big enough already). And we all know what happened to Sony's The Amazing Spider-Man franchise....",1
12,"Didn't get all the negative reviews from Critics. Surely it is not a perfect film, but not a bad film either.+ Loved the horror-action aspect of the movie+ Impressed with Sofia Boutella (although she doesn't had much screen time as Cruise though being the titular character)+ Found interest with the world of dark universe. Can't wait for the next project.+ Loved Russell Crowe as Jekyll & Hyde- Tom Cruise's performance was underwhelming- Sometimes they talked more than showing things (It can become boring sometimes)- Final battle was not overwhelming.They need to change the director in the sequel. Despite some flaws I think Dark Universe will be good. At least it didn't force some agenda (like Wonder Woman).",1
13,"This cynical and ill conceived attempt to start a Uni-""Monsterverse"" has one incredibly fatal flaw. When Marvel began their cinematic universe, all of the films were solid stand alone pictures true to the original material. This is a hopelessly convoluted mess that has nothing to do with the original screen legends.",0
14,"Burdened by relentless exposition, a terrible second act, an unfocused and convoluted screenplay, humour that never lands, and a tone that doesn't suit well with the campiness of the premise, Universal's reboot of 'The Mummy' celebrates the arrival of 'The Dark Universe' by burying it deep in the sand.",0
15,"Please don't be scared away by the low reviews! I went on opening night with my wife and 2 nephews and we had a blast with this movie! Is it a contender for best drama at this years academy awards? No. Is it a great summer popcorn movie with some great ideas and a few set ups towards future monster movies? absolutely! Give it a chance and have some fun, watch some special effects and jump in your seat a few times.",1
16,"Not sure why ""The Mummy"" is getting so much negative criticism.  Perhaps I don't understand the backstory that true movie buffs and geeks live by; however, I enjoyed the movie very much.  One prior reviewer said it was burdened with too much exposition but I feel just the opposite.  They explained enough to understand the storyline but the movie was full of action.  Also, I've always liked Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe performances and they didn't disappoint in this movie either.  I found the movie to be fast paced and exciting/suspenseful throughout the whole thing but not annoyingly so like the neverending action sequences in ""Man of Steel"" that felt like an hour of Superman and Zod smashing each other through buildings. (I agree with a prior reviewer that liked ""The Mummy"" better than any of the DC offerings so far.)  I liked the supporting cast in ""The Mummy"" and felt they all had good chemistry (did not feel the same about Henry Cavill and Amy Adams who seemed more like brother and sister).  I thought Universal set-up the Dark Universe adequately but again, I'm a nube to any backstory here.  I enjoyed it very much and would watch it again.  I can't say that for any of the DC movies, including ""Wonder Woman"" (although in fairness I was very tired when I watched it). And keep in mind, the movie is not ""Schindler's List"".  It's not meant to challenge or educate.  It's pure escapist entertainment.  So, if you want an action movie that resurrects the monster movies of old with a great cast, go see ""The Mummy"" regardless of what anyone else says.",1
17,"Kicking off the Dark Universe we have The Mummy, and what an awful way to start yet another franchise of seemingly never ending movies simply there to make as much money as possible. I had low expectations but it’s even worse than I imagined. Tom Cruise is in the desert and Tom Cruise is in a tomb and Tom Cruise is on a plane and Tom Cruise is so in your face all the time that I was actually rooting for the Mummy. Too bad the Mummy was as insignificant as the rest of the characters because this movie is all about, you guessed it. TOM CRUISE! On more than one occasion I had to resist the urge to fall asleep but oh don’t worry if you do decide to take a little nap because every single character will take a turn at explaining the plot to you. I could go on a rant about the lazy story, the miscasting and the cringy dialogue but who has the time. On a technical note a monster movie should never be released in 3D, aside from the increase in price 3D movies can lose up to 75% of light and 30% of colour so by all means make a colourful animation in 3D but not a dark and dreary monster movie set in London. And for what? A bird flying straight into your face and a mummified hand reaching out to you. Not worth it. Yet another failed monster movie to add to the ever growing pile of rubbish. Go see anything else instead or better yet watch the 1999 version because you better believe this version makes Brendan Fraser’s Mummy look like an absolute masterpiece. Not a chance am I recommending this.",0
18,"The Mummy is just all you could think it is. It tries so hard to become what it is today. Unfortunately for us, this is just a slap in our face excuse of a reboot of the Mummy franchise and can often be called a terrible start for the Dark Universe, a newly-made franchise that joins other monster movies released by Universal Studios. Spend your money elsewhere. This is not even worth a penny.",0
19,"The Mummy is an impressive action film which is well above average. If you're able to remove politics from the discussion then it is about on par with Wonder Woman in terms of overall quality. That is the problem, people cannot remove politics from their reviews and they don't want this film to compete at the box office with Wonder Woman because 'feminism.' That small minority of disingenuous reviewers are muddying the waters. I have personally watched both films at the cinema and they're both above average but neither is 'great', 'fantastic', or 'excellent' as some would describe them. The Mummy is worth a watch if you're a fan of a reliable Tom Cruise performance, or interesting fantasy elements, or satisfying action, or a predictable yet still interesting story.",1
20,Stop with remakes. The film is completely dispensable. Bad storyline. Weak performances.'The Mummy' has a few thrills but is dissatisfying and disappointing in every other sense.,0
21,"Absolutely horrid movie. First issue is Scientology's gift to movies, Tom Cruise. His ego mars any effort at entertainment. Secondly, a confused effort to tie the Mummy storyline to a continuous ""dark universe"" anthology. Waste of talent, badly written, and pales in graphics. And finally, the looming specter of Tom Cruise returning to any future DU movies is beyond frightening . . . total waste of time.",0
24,"If you want action, you are going to get your full summer quota.  You know the drill.  The story is completely implausible and the characters are practically super heroes.  Tom Cruise has an underwater sequence that had me gasping for air.  His sidekick Jake Johnson (I know him from ""Jurassic World"".  He is the geeky guy in the control room with all the toy dinosaurs lined up on his desk.  He is also a regular on ""New Girl"").  But, he is the funny one in the bunch.  And that is one thing I liked about the movie.  There are some good laughs.  Russell Crowe makes an appearance as a mad scientist, Dr. Henry Jekyll.  The ladies are interesting.  Annabelle Wallis plays Jenny, a young archaeologist looking for a dagger and stone that have magic powers.  And then there is the mummy!  Sofia Boutella plays Ahmenet, the crazy, bloodthirsty, power mad mummy returned to life.  I have never seen her before.  Although Boutella will be seen in ""Atomic Blonde"" when it comes out.  In general, thumbs were up.  It is fun and entertaining and should keep your interest.  We all thought it felt long, but in reality, it is less than two hours.  And, this is NOT a movie for young children!  This movie is scary!  There were lots of children in the audience and I am betting there were quite a few who nad nightmares about being chased by the undead.  But, if mummy movies are your thing, buy your popcorn and enjoy!",1
25,"Solid monster movie, althought he ending was quite a let down. No idea why people downvoted this movie into oblivion, but I heard the fact that ""Brendan Fraser wasn't in it"" played a big role here. After how terrible the third mummy movie was, it only makes sense to let someone else take the lead role... Preferably someone who still *has* a movie career.",1
26,"I don't know what people were expecting with a movie like The Mummy to be so disappointed with this one. It is a perfectly good movie for what it tries to be. The story is interesting the acting is good, the production values are high, the CGI is good, the sets are great, there is mystery, there is adventure, there is running, there is menace. I did not find myself checking the watch to see how much longer like I did in Wonder Woman. In short it is a good movie.",1
27,The movie is more like Mission Impossible than a mysterious movie as the previous The Mummy.It should be a standalone movie title instead of The Mummy.,0
28,I don't care what anyone says. I think The Mummy was an awesome movie.This movie is very fun to watch. Don't listen to the low rank critics. Its story and characters are very interesting.,1
29,I'm usually ultra forgiving of plot-holes but this movie has so many it's just sad. There is no way these film makers spent 2 seconds on countless issues with scenes that make no sense. The only other movie I really complained about so many laughable plot-holes was After Earth. This movie is *that bad.,0
31,"Some really poor dialogue for Cruise's character making him appear mentally challenged at times, a story that sets up for a ripoff of League of Extrodinary Gentlemen, and action that would liquify a normal human body (regardless of fitness level).  If this had more action it could have at least been as good as a Michael Bay flick, perhaps even scoring a five.  Worst line in the movie: ""If evil were a patheogen, he reasoned, then there must surely be a cure.""  If this logic is indicative of what the rest of the Dark Universe has to offer, we might as well kill the projector light on this series.",0
35,"""The Mummy"" was a somewhat strange film, because Tom Cruise did well his performance, Russell Crowe, and Sofia Bouttella also did well, but if the story, and the scenes did not seem well seen, were rather slow and little Disturbing, but the only thing I can save is the performance of Tom Cruise.",0
37,"Putting the Knights Templar assisting the evil character was tacky and an attack on Western Civilisation. It is quite frankly disgusting and I walked out of the film as a result. I used to enjoy some of the Mummy films in the past but attempting to position the Crusades as somehow negative, when the very purpose of the Crusades was about liberty and justice over savagery is beyond comprehension and disgusting. Completely ruined the film and I could not enjoy it. I am not sure if I could ever watch Russel Crowe or Tome Cruise again but on the positive side the mummy was very sexy and it is why rather than give a zero I am giving a one star.",0
38,An autobiographical deptiction of Tom Cruises rise to power in the ¢hur¢h of $¢ientology.Tom plays himself as a bumbling retard bent on doing anything and screwing over anyone for personal profit.,0
39,"As the beginning of a new film universe is okay, the movie is fun to watch and with good action scenes, the script I miss a bit more seriousness but in general is a good movie, I hope with each new movie from the Dark Universe Go up the quality standards / Como el inicio de un nuevo universo cinematografico esta bien, la pelicula es divertida de ver y con buenas escenas de accion, al guion le falto un poco mas de seriedad pero en general es una pelicula buena, espero que con cada nueva pelicula del Dark Universe vaya subiendo los estandares de calidad",1
40,I don't know why people have to complain so much. Its a movie just entertainment to pas time. I was expecting this to be quite bad but i actually enjoyed the different take on this movie. One thing i have learnt is if you lie trailer go see it if you like the actors go see it and ignore critics wether there so called processional or not. As every person Will like or dislike for there own reasons. I'm glad i did not listen to them. I hope they d do another.,1
41,"This kickoff of the new Universal Dark Universe monsters was entertaining. The story also has some great plot twists and a couple surprises. I thought it was entertaining, loved Hyde and Russel Crowe and also am now excited for the potential of the entire series.",1
42,"Watched Tom Cruise 's The Mummy,in one sentence, I liked it! It is my reaction after watching the movie! One reason for ; I liked the movie is because of stunning performance of my dear Tom Cruise!! He is still very good in delivering amazing real stunt performance! Background score is nice n cinematography is okay ! But the movie is lacking strong story plot n characterization, but in same time it entertains.it has a lot great action scenes, flight crash scene is insanely awesome;Real shooting that scene!Sofia well played as the mummy,her staring poss is cool! Ending of the movie is leading to next one! It is crazy ;) ,I love crazy effect, may be you don't!If you guys start comparing it to other mummy movies or other action movies ,it up to you to like or dislike! For me I find it as enjoyable action entertainer !! I liked it!Strictly personal!",1
43,I have no one else to blame but myself for going to see this movie. I've said it before and I will say it again beware of the movies which keep getting touted on TV commercial previews. A recipe for disappointment. Getting Tom Cruise & Russell Crowe to play parts just wasn't enough to elevate this cinema. SAVE YOUR MONEY,0
44,"This is getting some of the worst unnecessary critical hate I've ever seen. This film is packed with spectacular action/visuals, a great new twist on the old story with Cruise's character, and honestly a fine performance from Cruise overall. I honestly would take this over the 99 Mummy though i enjoy that film quite a bit, this film has way more going for it with its story and visuals. Just goes to show that critics are idiotic and the most of the simpleton masses will follow the hate because they have.",1
45,"Sweet Osiris! Boris Karloff couldn't have saved this unbelievably bad movie. The horrid script makes the A list actors look like fools; and I don't blame them, there is seriously nothing that any skilled actor could have done to save this movie.Usually I like reviewing bad movies just to keep going on and on about all of the problems (it's sort of a therapy), but with this trash heap it's not even worth it. There is no fun to be had here. Stay away.",0
47,"It has a strong plot and is shockingly realistic. When the Mummy punches, it is swift, brutal and powerful and it looks that way. Not the flashy fake-fighting you see in most movies. No romanticism: No ""Look! It's a Mummy!""--Que everything that gives off an Egyptian vibe--and it's dark. Very dark. Expect that. It's a monster movie. The main flaw was bad timing: too soon after the Mummy franchise. I watched it after seeing the review results the last few days. It didn't suck, guys. I do hope they take it up a couple of notches for the next Dark Universe movies. This sounds super cool.",1
48,An absolutely amazing Movie that had me on the edge the whole time.Tom is the perfect match for a serious take on the Mummy and does a wonderful job mixing his funny side with his serious side.The Story in itself is very good and the support is stellar. It is not your funny old Mummy with a ton of jokes but it doesnt matter. The Hero getting the godpowers the movie promisses the whole time is very satisfying and leaves open a truckload of possibilities. I hope it wont turn out to be an avengers copy with the good guys giving him work by beating the bad guys but him discovering more and more hidden to history secrets of old egypt and maybe mingle with other gods of the old time.,1
49,This movie is very fun to watch. Don't listen to the low rank critics. Its story and characters are very interesting. The Dark World is something I'd like to see more of.,1
50,"The Mummy is pure, cool fun that has me genuinely excited for the new shared movie experience known as Dark Universe. The movie is so satisfying from beginning to end that I'm pretty confident the critics saw something entirely different.",1
51,"The Alex Kurtzman directed reboot of ""The Mummy"" is a lot of fun. Normally, I do not care for Kurtzman as he wrote some of the most underwhelming to flat terrible modern blockbusters including films like ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"", ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"", and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"". However, ""The Mummy"" in my opinion is much better than all those movies though that's not saying much. Tom Cruise is definitely in his element here, he wears all the action and stunts like a perfect fit glove and carries much of the script with just his charisma. The new ""Mummy"" played by Sofia Boutella from ""kingsman"" and ""Star Trek: Beyond"" is both sexy and scary, more so on the former but she can chew scenery more so compared to Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep and Jet Li's Dragon Emperor from the Brendan Fraser led films. Now for those ""Critic"" reviews, a 16% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 34 Meta Score... give me a break the movie isn't THAT bad, yeah i'm a little bias cause I enjoyed it more so than many others but as a franchise starter it is most definitely better than last years fumbled ""Ghostbusters"" reboot (73% on RT), David Ayer's botched DCEU effort ""Suicide Squad"" (25%), and it is leagues above Ridley Scott's franchise destroying ""Alien: Covenant"" (71%). The reviews for ""The Mummy"" are a gross over reaction by modern ""critics"" who are either much to harsh on would be franchise starting blockbusters (Ex. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) or far too forgiving on Nostalgia driven revamps (Ex. Jurassic World). Thankfully, This new ""Mummy"" does not rely on the past movies to set it up as it seeks out it's own cinematic world via the ""Dark Universe"". Yeah I know that ""Ghostbusters"" set up it's ""Ghost Corp"" before crashing and burning, but I feel that as a starting point, this world still has some interesting layers to unwrap.",1
52,"""The Mummy"" is yet another desperate special effects-driven modern mess from Hollywood that favours expensive, pretentious, no-longer-impressive CG razzle-dazzle and awkward set-pieces designed to tease later films over a coherent and gripping narrative and interesting characters. Like many movies designed to be part of a ""cinematic universe"", it just cannot stand on its own because the filmmakers crammed in so many unnecessary plot threads relating to the other upcoming Dark Universe films that it's less about thrills and fun and feels more like a very, very long advertisement for the entire series. And that's not what a film called ""The Mummy"" should feel like. Thanks to this film I'm once again concerned about the future of blockbuster movies. New cinematic universes are constantly being planned and it's ruining the art form, making it a chore to sit through overextended movies and memorise plot threads. It's all done to keep hype constantly going, which maximises the box office grosses because everyone just wants to see what references to other movies will show up. Well done, Hollywood for once again proving to the world that, apart from the occasional surprise (see Wonder Woman) your filmmakers are no longer interested in making films for everyone - only for themselves, to satisfy their hyperactive imaginations (and wallets). I will definitely be watching more independently produced, underground and low-budget films after this because I can no longer suffer this ongoing cinematic universe trend.",0
53,"This is the first ""Dark Universe"" movie. It's an attempt from Universal Studios to create a big movie franchise. As an IP launch, it's a complete dud. From the trailer it looks like a big disaster flick with the ancient Egyptian goddess returning to wreak havoc. In reality, it more of an intimate encounter with lots of dialogue (there are basically only 6 characters). Tom Cruise heads the roster. He's trying to create a devil-may-care character, but it's not convincing. Meanwhile, the story is dull, the visual effects aren't unique or innovative and the action sequences are never especially original or exciting. There's nothing to recommend this movie (unless you enjoy seeing Cruise shirtless for a few seconds).",0
54,"The action scene that occurs inside a plummeting plane was among the best action scenes in the history of film. It is quite obvious they actually filmed it - many takes - in a plummeting aircraft produce the effects of zero gravity. It is insane to watch.Tom Cruise gives his all and then some as usual in his films and the ancient mummy woman does a fantastic job.The weakness of this film is that there are no real surprises or twists until the end, and that twist at the end is not something an audience wants to see. Our action heroes may be beaten, have their limbs broken, and can even be killed in movies, but audiences never want to see their heroes lose control of who they are. That was the huge error in the second Indiana Jones movie, and it was an error at the end of this movie even though Tom Cruise was able to be heroic when required.That said, this film is way way better than most reviews give it credit for. Since it is now rentable, rent it. It's a fun film with intense action sequences.",1
56,"Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended,Not recommended.",0
57,"So. Egyptian mummy-princess, evil egyptian god, undead crusader knights, Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, a secret society, all under London. The expression on Tom Cruise's face all along the movie kind of says: What am I even doing here?Seriously really bad. Not exciting or nostalgic, just terrible. Honestly, this thing makes the original Mummy movie seem artistic and deep. LOL",0
58,"This is a poor start to a new cinematic universe, and I went with low expectations and was still disappointed. There are some well-shot action sequences, and I do like what Universal is going for here, setting up a world where many different monsters coexist, like Cabin in the Woods, but what we get with this are a bunch of tired PG-13 action cliches. Oh, and I should also mention that the film is not scary at all, so that's a fail. Let's talk about the comic relief. Why is it needed? This is the ""Dark Universe"", so the tone should be kept serious, but screenwriters seem to always think that audiences want this, so we have to endure bad joke after bad joke. Of course we get the wise-cracking sidekick who seems to be trying too hard to get a laugh, but all characters get some line that's supposed to be funny but comes off as awkward, and it ruins any suspense that a scene may have been building toward. Humor especially ruined the scene where Tom Cruise wakes up in a body bag after coming back from death. What should have been very dramatic was just supposed to be funny because he woke up naked. PG-13 humor at its finest! Now I'd like to address the flashbacks to The Mummy's origin story. The flashbacks were way overused, and they begin probably no more than ten minutes after we see them originally. This is when I felt that the director thought his audience had very short attention spans and had to be constantly reminded of plot elements throughout the film. Now, as for The Mummy herself, she looks great, has a creative design, but she's hardly menacing like she's supposed to be, and her zombified minions are not much better. She doesn't have a world domination plan like Imotep from the 1999 Mummy franchise, she just wants Ethan Hunt, and that's it. Also, ripping off the face-in-the-sandstorm scene from the '99 movie was so unnecessary, and there wasn't even a good reason for it. If Universal is going to continue with a universe based on horror films, they need to put effort into actually scaring us.",0
59,"1999 Brendan Fraser film was much much better. Don't go to cinema don't even watch it at home. It's hard to believe that with all the budget, Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe they end up doing such dog ****",0
60,"For the first time ever, i have walked out in the cinema midway through a movie. This movie is so bad. When you watch the trailer, you think that it will be a dark and serious film about an ancient mummy. It's the complete opposite. The humour is so bad and cringy that it has taken cheese to another level, it wasn't even funny. Even worse was the acting. What has happened to Tom Cruise? He has become like Nicholas Cage. This movie should be called The Zummy. They were zombies not mummies.",0
61,its a turkey through and through. the trailer with the missing audio was more entertaining than this. Tom Cruise plays the same character in all his movies. The extended universe baloney interferes halfway including a gawdawful scene involving Crowe's hamsandwich acted Mr.Hyde. The romance is forced and unearned and instead of using creative ideas to solve problems the movie uses brute force and plot armor to hurry things along. the movie is resolved poorly without any rhyme reason or explanation. it just phuckin ends with a crappy open ending.,0
62,I would not compare this movie to the first Mummy movie.  It was a fun movie with lots of action and a decent story.  If you are one that just likes to be entertained without analyzing ever aspect of a movie then go see it.,1
63,A pesar de tener el conocimiento de que me disponía a ver una película de fantasía con el fin de entretenerme después de un largo día el resultado fue totalmente decepcionante. No voy a enumerar la incongruencias del film porque no terminaría nunca. Las actuaciones dejan mucho que desear. Está en el top de las peores películas que he visto este año. Cero puntos.,0
64,"Give me back my 3,5€ i only watched the mummy because king arthur and alien were only available at a later time and because of that it wouldnt be possible for me to go home. Basically this crap of movie is 75% cliche american movie, 5% a fat man trying to speedrun an explanation for the movie's plot (anda fails miserably), 5% the main character i dont remember his name but i'll call him Uncharted, 10% of the movie being nonsensical (this probably explains the average american IQ) and finally 5% of the movie trying to be like an anime (i won't spoil this but basically uncharted screams ""wake up!"" and the girl screams ""onii-chaaaaaaan!"", a nonsense scene). So if you cannot afford a PS4 and always wanted to play Uncharted and if you are ok with a wannabe chinese version this movie is for you.",0
65,"I read a lot of bad reviews for this so was expecting to be disappointed, however I was pleasantly surprised... I really enjoyed it. It is nonsense of course but very well done. Tom Cruise always delivers. If I want intelligent and thought provoking Drama I watch HBO If I want spectacular fun I go to the cinema.. The Mummy doesn't disappoint.",1

69,"An excellent start to the Dark Universe! A perfect original plot with a special guest appearance of another monster is perfect. Acting is amazing and CGI effects are top notch and much better than Fraser's attempts. Every step of the way is humorous, terrifying and twists you'll never expect.

71,"Setting out to create their own cinematic universe, Universal Pictures resurrects ""The Mummy"" as a tonally inconsistent star vehicle for Tom Cruise. It wants to be a horror movie, but constantly shoehorns in humor and action reminiscent of Marvel's superhero films in order to ensure mainstream appeal. It's efforts to set up the larger world of this ""Dark Universe"" consisting of rebooted versions of Universal's classic monster properties is interesting, but muddled. It is yet unclear how everything is going to come together. That's not the problem. The problem is that after this sorry introduction, I'm not very interested in learning how.It's hard to care about anything happening onscreen. The story is a bit of a mess, the dialog is incredibly cliché, and the characters are bland stereotypes. The most interesting aspects are the horror ones, which unfortunately are neutered in order to not scare away the general public. I'm sorry, but I thought these were supposed to be monster movies. You can pretty much predict everything that's going to happen so any excitement is automatically drained away. Tome Cruise hams it up while playing his typical smarmy guy role that he's just getting too old for. Everyone else is just kind of there, including Russell Crowe who has a surprisingly minor and practically useless role in the film. Somebody's just there for that cinematic universe money (good luck with that). The sole shinning light in this whole ordeal is Sofia Boutella. While she plays a totally weak villain, she does manage to be drop dead sexy in the process and show some much appreciated skin.There's a lot going on in this reboot of The Mummy. Almost none of it is any good. It's manages to capture all of the worst qualities of a Tom Cruise movie. It's a flat, stale, and pandering effort that will leave the majority of viewers bored and wanting so much more. A poor way to kick off a cinematic universe. Universal would have honestly just been better off keeping the also vanilla ""Dracula Untold"" as their first step. While only marginally better, at least that one was likely to have more of a following. Skip this. If this one hasn't already derailed their plans, we're all better off just waiting to see what Universal comes up with next for their Dark Universe. Outside of Sofia Boutella's butt, there's nothing here worth seeing, and you can google that. Things are very ""dark"" indeed.3.6/10",0
72,what an ugly mess from start to finish. disjointed story focus's on the wrong characters and it seems someone has completely screwed the entire story and plot. The only positive this movie has is great special effects.,0
75,This should have been rated R. The sexual scenes are not brief and the dark scenes are disturbing. And the plotline was stupid. At least the previous movies had a mix of humor and action.,0
77,"As always ""pro"" USA critics are nothing more as shtasses, they rate high shty movies, when good 1s they rate low/ Fk USa critics. Fk ""pro"" movie critics, they are thresh.",1
79,"I knew when Hollywood shooed out Brendan Fraser it was going to get bad. Fraser was fun and entertaining and built for a concept like this. He was incredible. Tom Cruise is my dude, but he wasn't made for this movie.",0
80,"Una película entretenida que le da un giro diferente a lo que era la trilogía anterior de 'La Momia'. Bien, un buen producto de entretenimiento.",1
81,"The Mummy hardly understands itself. As an action film, the scenes are so haphazard they might as well have been an accident. As a horror, it lacks any sort of believable authenticity in its storytelling to make any element consistent and interesting. As a starting point for the Dark Universe Cinematic Universe, it's an abysmal failure. Not even big stars like Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe could save this forgettable flick.",0
82,"Dig it. I loved it. Maybe it is not super movie. But this new (yeah, reawaken) Universe has so much potential. Just for a moment look at DC/Marvel movies. So few are really good. Most of them are just moderate at best. Dark Universe. Sounds fresh. Marvel-DC loop must be extended. Looking forward to see more.PS: it's funny that critics gave a lower rating than users. no money - no positive reviews, ay?",1
84,ok I will admit I didn't expect much judging just by the reviews of the movie but however I did get a shock kinda I honestly didn't think it was all that bad yea I mean it wasn't the best but I did like the amount of action and comedy they blended well together to make a great time at the movies I say more a rent then a run to go see but I do recommend seeing it,1
86,Why? What went wrong? Cruise has a high low threshold but this story does not make sense. It's like it has no soul or something. Unengaging and boring waste of money and time.,0
87,I don't care what anyone says. I think The Mummy was an awesome movie. Not as good as the one before this but...... yeah.great movie,1
88,To be honest I thought this film would have been a lot better than it was. Considering the previous films before it performed fairly well. There were a lot of segments in this film that were supposed to be humorous when in fact it was the exact opposite. I think I expected more out of the cast along with a better storyline. Overall not a huge fan of the movie and would not recommend it for others to see.,0
89,"I cannot understand this so negative rating to this movie. The cast was great and the story was a way better than the 'original' horrible movies. The Mummy is a very good movie, a well-deserved 7, but I put a 10 to raise the average due to poor ratings by poor users.",1
90,"So glad metacritic allows ratings of ""0"" - no more would be adequate for this steaming pile of abused celluloid.Bad performances of not so great actors, a ridiculously implausible story and terrible slapstick throughout the scenes made this a displeasure to watch.If you like movies, possess intelligence and or loved the original Mummy for it's wit and pacing, stay away. If it's too late, switch off the movie or attempt to drown the brain cells loaded with the putrid memories of it in something high proof.Ugh.",0
91,"Wake up, Hollywood. How does a movie with great special FX fail in the middle of the summer blockbuster season? Casting directors need to take serious note here - the only person who still thinks Tom Cruise is awesome is Tom Cruise. The real-life arrogance and egotism shines through ridiculously and viewers have tired of it. Had Chris Pratt or Jeremy Renner been cast in the lead, the box-office gross would have been far different.",0
92,"Watched it with very low expectations, but came out pleasantly surprised.Filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler",1
95,"It was definitely worth watching. Not great, but a good way to start the Dark Universe. Lots of great characters, great moments, and seeing a female mummy was interesting.",1
98,Terrible movie. Save yourself the stress and don't see this. Waste of time. Seems more like a satire movie than a serious dark one. errible character development. And the best part of the movie (Dr Jekyll and his lab) was given very little time and no history. What a disgrace.,0
102,even tho it was a little better than trying to watch new pirates. i still watched it more than new pirates.. dam...it seemed like the actors were told to know that it was going to be a terrible flop. it was full of stars for no reason other than to get people hopes up in the commercials...the worse part by far was the unclear meaning of the mummy kiss and stabs that tom cruise uses on himself which i believe was somehow designed by an idiot with both a lesbian unwrapped mummy fetish as well as a terrible movie fetish...perhaps the idea was top show how easy it is to top the mummy 3(tomb of the dragon emperor) ..maybe to catch new charlie and the graphics again ill watch it again with out lag.....maybe there is a nice cat i missed?,0
110,"Very boring movie. Plot hogwash. In the movie no, there is nothing good except cast. And could remove an excellent analog of ""Uncharted"" in a film world. And the mediocre movie which so boring that even houses in front of the TV hunting to switch off has turned out.",0
111,"Voici le Tom Crouze aux prises avec une momie très vindicative qui va semer un joyeux bordel dans notre monde (jeu, Seth et match...). Pardon pour ce calembour effroyable mais le ton souvent hystéro-bouffon du film m'a con-taminé.On se demande si ce n'est pas une pure comédie assez idiote et décousue d'ailleurs... c'est écrit avec les pieds et mélangé maladroitement (et n'importe comment) avec de l'héroïsme (une maladie causée par la vanité) et une petite morale sur le bien et le mal sortie d'un Kinder Surprise. Tout ça pour donner le beau rôle à ce bellâtre usé et fatigué, cette grande gueule qui n'en finit plus de rouler des mécaniques, le petit Tommy et ses talonnettes.La méchante momie est jouée tant mal que bien par notre Boutella nationale : il faut dire qu'avec sa vilaine tronche, elle a la sale gueule de l'emploi. C'est pour ça qu'à la Boutella, je préfère le Nutella en fait. Sinon à part ça, Tom s'est amouraché d'une blondasse qui n'a pas inventé l'eau chaude, juste un faire-valoir pour Tommy le héros !Cela dit, c'est filmé à peu près correctement et on ne s'ennuie pas... et puis ce bon vieux Russell montre encore les crocs dans un (petit) rôle assez drolatique... C'est bien pour ça que j'irais jusqu'à 2 dans mon infinie mansuétude.",0
112,"La MomieUn reboot sympathique..-Du côté de l'histoire elle est intéressante, mais difficile à d'écrire sans spoil. Il y a des rebondissements intéressants et une fin qui annonce du bon pour la suite.-Au niveau effets spéciaux et design, les zombies ont des capacités intéressantes . Quand les zombies sont frappés, les bras et jambes passent à travers le corps décédé du zombie, c'est du génie... #RIPTheWalkingDead.-Lors d'une phase de combat la Momie détruit les vitres et les transformes en sable c'est géniale!:). Il y a d'autres exemples: [spoiler]    #Regeneressence , #Docteur D    [/spoiler]    . On nous a habitués à ne pas réfléchir quand vient le temps de rentrée au cinéma, mais ce film ne nous prend pas pour des faibles. Mais il se sert des rudiments physiques de notre vie. C'est très plaisant.Un bon moment au côté de Tom Cruise?!.. OUI !:",1
115,"Complete MessThe Mummy is a terrible reboot who’s only purpose is to set up sequels THAT WE NEVER ASKED FOR!, That out of the way, The acting is bland, the script is a complete mess, the visuals are mediocre at best, and the fight scenes are pretty boring.",0
116,"I'm not sure why this movie cops it so bad. I really enjoyed the Mummy, great performances, except for Tom Cruises sidekick. Some great action scenes, shame really, because it sets up for what may have been a great number 2.",1
117,"The Dark Universe is dead before it could get started. All it takes is one film, that has uninteresting characters, confusing ideology, and unresolved plot points to set up for 5+ sequels",0
120,"I can't contemplate why films are so bad considering the budget they get. On paper; good actors, potentially good writers, so why is the film so poor? What went wrong?- Child like brotherly relationship in the face of extreme danger. - Soldier General doesn't seem overly concerned that two of his soldiers, I assume secret ops, are running around illegally stealing things for profit, completely off mission.- Hot girl (I assume non-military?) - (why is an archaeologist on the front line military?) arrives on scene conviniently asking for a map that Cruise stole after having sex with her. Conviniently she seems to be an expert on the tomb they magically uncovered. How lucky.- All three of them; two of them grave thieves, seemingly unqualified, and childlike, get sent down in to the tomb, on the archaeologists authority? Since when do military listen to achaeologists...- Magically they crash land in London, and Cruise is kept alive. Ok; if the gods have the magical powers to do that, then surely she wouldn't be running around in human form, and buried in the ground by humans, in the first place. She gets done over by a couple darts again in modern times.- Dr Jekyl and Hyde is the mastermind behind the archaeology department running the military..... Couple running (not sexist then is it) away from danger ensues. +1 that Annabelle Wallis can run! They cast her well. As fast as Cruise though? He is short so maybe.- 'good' Love and Heroism conquers 'evil'. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL.Apparently this is the start of a high budget series. Going to be as bad as the marvel stuff I assume.",0
121,Love the animation and VFX. such great and amazing CGI. the story needed so much work but overall I loved the movie and it was so entertaining for me.,1
123,"I absolutely loved this movie Sofia  Sofia Boutella is beautiful so hard to believe that a monster can be so enchanting. Not a huge fan of Tom Cruz but I did enjoy this movie, Sofia Boutella  is what made this movie never heard of her before but man was she great I give this movie a 8 out of 10 I give Sofia Boutella a 20 out of 10",1
125,"I LOVE this type of movie, don't get me wrong. Big tub of popcorn and just have fun. But this may be the worst movie I have seen in the last 10 years. Cruise is charmless and ridiculous. Crowe is embarrassing. Only the women put in strong performances. Ish. The special effects are from the 99 cent store and the script was written by 9 year olds whose best subject is clearly not English or creative writing. I've witnessed more creativity and effot in Geico commercials. And the director should move on to the fast food industry.Thanks, Universal and greedy, talent-less producers for wasting my time and money with this complete garbage.",0
128,"Annabelle Wallis' performance was horrible and Tom Cruise did not do well the first half, but he really picked it up in the second half of the movie. Russell Crowe was excellent as Mr. Hyde. Sofia Boutella was good as the Mummy also. Great film, very underrated.",1
130,"What the hell did I just see?This has to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the experience of going to see it. It gave me some ideas of what to do and not do in a future roleplaying game I will run, but definitely that was a big piece of trash.First let's get this out of the way. The movie isn't really about ""The Mummy"". It is a masturbatory story for and about Tom Cruise.The Mummy character itself was given the shaft in this movie. The actress (Sofia Boutella) and the character (named Ahmanet) is what I find to be the best part of the movie. She is beautiful, powerful and even with her limited material had a great intensity. She was the only good thing in the movie. Yet she had what seemed like the least runtime out of her, the blonde girl, Cruise or Crowe. There was so much potential with her, yet they hacked her part apart so badly she seemed like a bit player in the movie.Russell Crowe was both good and bad. I like Russell Crowe, and I don't feel bad about it. I liked the witty comments of Mr. Hyde, and I realize Crowe can have a wooden performance, but in this case, the character itself was written poorly, so Crowe didn't have much to work with.Cruise's love interest (I will refer to her as the nameless blond) was horrible. She was so bad I don't remember her character or the actresses' name. To make it even worse, I don't care to know it. Her character was cardboard, flavorless and absolutely did nothing for me. I realize I can't blame that on the actress, but evidently I don't even care enough to try and get past that.Tom Cruise is problematic in a lot of ways. I like him in some roles (yes I liked Collateral and the Last Samurai). He is flavorless as well in things like Mission Impossible. Then he is horrible in movies like in this one. I hated his character itself, the presented personality, the cockiness, just about everything he said made me wish I could blow him up with my mind.The worst part of the movie is the fact they butchered all of the Mummy's (Ahmanet) parts so Cruise could have a larger part. I hear it is because the director was a rookie and Cruise was ""helping"" the director, but that didn't help anything at all for me.I also disliked what Cruise's character became, I realize he is the referential ""Mummy"", and I didn't consider that suave, cool or even a surprise. I was just disappointed that she wasn't the Mummy in future films (except maybe a villain). That was the biggest disappointment for me.This was the first movie in a new film franchise, the ""Dark Universe"" that combines all of Universal's monster IPs into a single Marvel/DC type thing. They want to share the universe with Dracula, the Mummy, Frankenstein's Monster, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, etc.I think that is an awesome idea. The problem here is they went too far into it for the first movie. They wanted to make references to too many things and instead there was too much explanatory setup and too little story about the Mummy. They would have been better off to have a few easter eggs of the other IPs, and maybe a cameo. Some say Crowe was a cameo, that wasn't a cameo, that was way too large a part to be anything but disasterous.The good: Sofia Boutella was a great actress, and her character was awesome. I will follow her more.The bad: Everything else was eye gougingly bad... except Russell Crowe, he was ok.",0
132,"Film di serie Z ad alto budget, chiunque dica il contrario non sa cosa siano cinematografia, sceneggiatura o regia ed infatti a ricoprire questi ruoli non sono persone competenti.Non dò 0 perchè qualcosa nella trama è innpvativo e non del tutto copiato da altre storie.Le scene d'azione saranno anche carine, ma sembrano girate da 3 persone diverse, senza che nessuno abbia controllato l'effetto finale, piccolo esempio senza spoiler, un autobus si ribalta e nella scena seguente il protagonista vi è tranquillamente seduto in posizione verticale...per errori del genere non ci sono valide giustificazioni.",0
134,"The movie is bad. Tom Cruise was a lousy choice has he tries to be funny and he isn't. So he's miles below what Brendan Fraser did on the first 2 Mummy movies. The script is beyond stupidity. Why the hell had the crusaders and Jekyll and Hyde to show up in the movie? Do they add anything interesting? And the fact that the whole movie is on Iraq and UK doesn't help either... Did they remember it was a egyptian mummy (there's a slight scene in Egypt at the end, they must have thought it would give a nice touch...)? The supposedly funny supporting character isn't. The hero's love is really bad. The only vaguely saving grace is the mummy itself. Effects are nice but pointless with all this. Just do yourself a favor watch the first 2 movies and have a few laughs. Ignore this one.",0
