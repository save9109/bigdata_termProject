0," Just read the comments of those who gave it a 10. ""The girls were hot."" ""Robots blew stuff up."" ""There were lots of awesome swear words."" ""The mom ate pot brownies."" ""The chihuahua was humping a bigger dog (twice)."" If those things sound like something you would be interested in, keep in mind, those were the HIGH points of the movien, then by all means, go for it. I actually liked the first one and the action was actually quite good, but 0 to counteract all those artifical 10s.",0
1, Somehow much worse then the first one. Somehow.,0
2,"Why is it that all these 2 1/2 hour long Michael Bay films feel like they're 4 or 5 hours long? It never ends with the and badly edited action scenes full of clunky-CGI , and the terrible humor, the incomprehensible plot, and the shallow characters both human and robot that I could never care much about. It goes on and on and on, and was overstaying it's welcome for me at about the hour mark. There are few amusing moments, some sparks of a decent special effects scene, but for the most part it's just a bunch mindless dribble that serves no purpose I can think of, not even on the basic level of entertainment for anyone above the age of 14 or so.",0
3,"Frankly, how bad could it be? Critics rip it to shreds, calling dumb, loud, and stupid, but it's a movie about giant robots smashing each other, so what did you expect? I expect Michael Bay to acknowledge that humans traditionally have brains. That's the problem with Transformers 2. You can complain all you want about the racist robots, the lame dialogue, the annoying human characters, and overstuffed action sequences, but it all comes down to one central problem. Yes, we all expected Transformers 2 to be loud, dumb, and stupid. The problem is that it is simply TOO loud, dumb, and stupid. It is loud, dumb, and stupid to the degree that it actually feels insulting as you watch it. The anger that possessed me during Transformers 2 was almost too much to bear. The idea that Michael Bay actually thinks we as a human race will tolerate something this stupid.",0
4,"This is an embarrassing script for all Transformer fans.  The film looks good with its big budget, but by the end of this film you just don't care about anything.",0
5,"If you can easily check your brain at the door (after counting out the price of the ticket, of course) then Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen is for you.Loads of special effects, some juvenile ""humor"" and not much else will undoubtedly entertain, unless you tend to want more than a series of explosions with no reason behind them.",0
6," Awful. There is simply nothing to redeem this film. Where do I begin to describe how thoroughly unpleasant an experience it was to watch this movie! From the very beginning one of the biggest problems is Bays inability to keep the camera static for even a second. The worst example of this is in a scene early on in the movie in which Sam and Mikaela are stood talking to each other in a romantic embrace, this had potential to be a romantic and engaging moment in an otherwise emotionally barren film, however Bay has the camera doing 360 degree whirls all over the place, completely ruining the moment. This is also true for the fights between the robots, when metal meets metal it",0
7, This movie was so bad that it made me enjoy the first one. I thought the first one was a bad movie. But now I can aprreciate the original for this turd of a movie.,0
8," Final Review of Transformers. Overlong, under-plotted, no character development, and the fight scenes were shot badly. Predictable, not even a little bit fun. Only humor was racial stereotyped robots. That got old fast. And more plot holes than i could count. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I loved the first one but this was one movie I considered walking out of.",0
9," Typical Michael Bay tripe. Went because my son wanted to see it on IMAX. Sorry I spent any money on it. No thought required, just excessive overly crafted CGI battle after battle. Loud, obnoxious, pointless. The acting was extremely poor, the story almost impossible to ascertain, the jokes were very tasteless and near racially offensive. As someone who grew up with Transformers during my youth, all I can say is Bay's interpretation of the franchise is a complete travesty. Is this the future of ""blockbusters""? Films where you pay $10 to shut off your brain at the door and go ""oo, pretty lights"" for two and a half hours? If so, count me out.",0
10, We paid for a movie but,0
11," I love robots blowing each other up. And Meagan Fox is a huge plus, but this movie is terrible. It really could not have been any worse. The beginning for slightly interesting, then the whole thing after about 45 minutes goes down hill. The last hour is mind numbingly boring.",0
12," Worst movie of the summer. If you are expecting 150 minutes of special effects with no story or characters then you will not be disappointed. Not suitable for young kids as there is animal copulation, foul language and offensive racial stereotypes. For shame Mr Speilberg, you have lost the plot big time.",0
13," There are some movies that get better after you watch it a 2nd time. Maybe you missed a crucial bit of info or didn't understand some scenes. Transformers 2 is not one of those movies. Because I have a child who missed our first sitting, I've been forced back in to see it again, and frankly, I feel like I've been robbed twice!!!",0
14," All these 9-10 score reviews are probably the same 2 fanboy-losers in their moms basement (hey man! let's go online and keep posting how awesome this movie is!). Just go up the page a bit and look at the reviews. Read any review not written by a 17-year old boy whose testicles just dropped last week, and it is negative because this movie is just terrible. Just awful. If you like this movie, do the world a favor and hide somewhere please. And never speak.",0
15," Quite possibly the worst movie I've seen in years. Racism and ingnorance about drugs aside, the cinematography and writing were terrible. And I actually enjoyed the first one.",0
16, If there was a -10 rating I would give that to this movie. Fiasco of the century.,0
17," Hey film studios lets take a ridiculously crappy actor... Say Shia LaBeuyfe That played in the worst channel that was ever on television... Say Disney. With the most ridiculous roles.... Say He plays a retard in a Disney channel movie and a poor comedy show as well... Wait its coming to me. And put him in everyone's action nostalgia movie. In which he just waters down all the good qualities that this movie can have... Say Transformers. Also, lets make the movie without an interesting/engaging story, so that his role is, in fact, meaningless. Sounds like it will be a hit.",0
18," When my NINE year old nephew looked up at me and said ""This movie is very baaaaad. When will it end?"" You know this is a horrible movie.",0
19,"This movie sucks optimus prime's balls, and the storyline is crap. Who would in their right mind watch a long ass movie that only thing that made this movie alot of money is Megan Fox and great graphics.",0
20,"Revenge of the Fallen is beyond stupid with some of the dumbest characters ever put on screen. Acting was pitiful. Story complete garbage, if there was even one, coupled with racism everywhere in the film. Nothing could be worst for Michael bay who has just added another terrible movie to his resume.",0
21,"Another witless attempt at moviemaking from the always terrible Michael Bay. The first Transformers wasn't even that bad, at least not until the end, but this plotless recreation is a complete disaster. It could be the worst movie of the past twenty years.",0
22, This movie is as dumb as paint.,0
23," This movie looks good, but that's the only achievement it gets. Everything else about it plainly sucks and it is hard to recommend this movie to anyone, even elder kids.",0
24," The first was OK, the second put me to sleep. (literally, my lady friend said I was snoring :P )",0
25," Plenty of action for a summer movie, the two hour plus movie promises to fill your time with plenty of random explosions and mindless acting. My biggest problem with the movie is the overplayed humping jokes, references to the male genitiles, and language. I would not take a kid under 13 to this movie however plenty of parents brought their 5 and 6 year olds. It disturbing to hear a 4 year old kid laugh at robots calling each other and humans b**ch, using the word p*ssy, and s*it. If you don't care about what morales you kids learn from movies then this is for you. I'm sad because I don't remember the first one being so bad.",0
26," Over two hours of non-stop mayhem, but in a bad way. Michael Bay clearly does not care one bit about story, character or good humour. His only concern is for shiny metal and skin, big bangs and SFX budgets through the roof. The man is a menace to modern cinema. Probably the most mind numbingly dumb film I have seen since Batman & Robin.",0
27," Too long and boring. Megan Fox is nice to look at, but that was about it. Trust the reviews and don't waste your money.",0
28,"It's a bad movie. A huge Dissapoint film. First of all the VFX dazzles your mind and gives you headaches and migraines! If James Cameron and Uwe Boll made a stink pile it would be still better. No point, no story and no meaning! Tis film is one of the VFX crap Hollywood produces and Micheal Bay, oh my goodness! This great director is going for some s*** in movie history! I am fed up of stupid sequels! Give us new stuff man! It stands no choice against the batted good film Transformers and its worse than Dark of the Moon,",0
33,"This is, without exaggeration, the absolute worst movie I have seen in the last ten years. Not only because it's a million kinds of awful, but because of what it represents. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen symbolizes not just everything condescending, cynical, and soulless in Hollywood, it stands as a testament to sub-crustal standards and the triumph of a strong marketing campaign over effort, talent and vision. Batman and Robin has been dethroned.",0
34," Let me start off by saying I've enjoyed the first for what it was but most of this film made me literally angry, it was so fucking shit. The dialogue/ characters was disastrous, Uwe Boll looks like a genius next to this fucking moron and 90% of the time in the fighting scenes I couldn't even tell WHY there were explosions and it just seemed like a shit load of metal sounds. It's also odd how the robots acted so much like humans in the way they fight/ act/ talk. I didn't pick up on that the first film but I did here, probably because there is much more dialogue scenes and so on which were NOT needed and yeah, just literally pissed me off over how dumb they were. Oh and when an old robot is re-activated he has a beard and a walking cane WHAT THE FUCK!? Fucking ridiculous movie that highlights everything wrong with American culture. The mom character especially. oh.my.fucking.god, she was so fucking terrible, I just wanted to stick a chainsaw in someone's eye. And no you can't say ""lol just go in it and have some fun"", that WAS my attitude before it started pissing me off with scene after scene of absurd idiocy. The humour pisses me off just thinking about it...When the dad slaps the mother's ass, the main douchebag guy says ""hey watch it, this isn't a rap video""....Yeah...wow. And the way he says it adds to the annoyance. The effects were spectacular, I'd give it that. I loved when robots got sliced you could literally see very inch of metal, wires and whatever come apart and that was about all I've enjoyed along with some of the action scenes. And the overall story was kind of interesting if it was told better but it wasn't and unfortunately the great story that seemed to be in there just couldn't come out under such retarded direction which is a huge shame. 2/10.",0
35," This is not a movie, this is a scene from a video game that ran a half hour too long. Beautiful visuals paired with the lowest common denominator of what is supposed to be a script.",0
36," This movie was pathetic. All it is, is the attempt to glorify the military power of the US, which are basically impotent to what ever battle the transformers are engaged in. I can't believe that the decepticons are so inaccurate with there weapons? and how Sam seems to outrun them every time and never the need for a sip of water? This movie doesn't deserve taking up HD space.",0
37, One of the most worst sequels I've seen in a long time. See it and be bored out of your mind.,0
38,"i hated this movie. absolutely terrible. wether its the absolutely terrible ""humor"" sequences, the obscured, boring fights, or the stereotyped robots, there isnt a single redeeming quality in this ""blockbuster sequel"" of a movie and deserves nothing but 0 as a movie, and as a form of an example of a terrible movie.",0
39,"The original Transformers was a flawed movie, sure, but it was very fun with a decent script to make Transformers fit into the modern age of Blockbusters. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen, however, is a mix of computer generated effects, pots and pans clashing together, and vomit. The movie is a mess, from a horrible script, to annoying characters, to mindless explosions and action. Revenge of the Fallen took what worked in the first movie, made those aspects not work as well, and for the aspects that didn't work, made them a thousand times worse!",0
40," The low point in a lackluster directing career. Transformers: rotf fails on almost... no every level imaginable. Poor acting (slow motion running + screaming random names), terrible design (transformer fights end up looking like scrap metal in a pile rolling), offensive and painful attempts at comedy (haha the hip hop autobots can't read and have gold teeth what a knee slapper.), and a barely there plot all help this 2 hr 27 min dud sink to the bottom of the barrel. If you've seen the trailer you have seen more than enough.",0
41,The other day I thought about watching this movie again and got a sour taste in my mouth that I had to wash away with garlic fries and soda. The sad part is that I've known people to pay and watch this movie at least 4 times IN THEATER.,0
42,"I can't remember the last time I desparately wanted to walk out of a movie. I felt cheated and insulted by this movie. It's offending to even think that they consider this entertainment, what-more, to charge a full ticket price of this garbage.",0
44," This movie from start to finish was the most god-awful thing I've ever seen in my entire life. We had some good action, but when it really came down to it, ROTF fell way short of it's predecessor. I'll break it down into plus and minuses. + More Transformers + More action sequences full of ridiculous explosions + Optimus Prime finally does something Now for the minuses. -Horribly racist transformers (the twins) -Worst love story in the history of movies -Dumb side-character who gets picked up and doesn't shut up the entire movie -Toilet humor... Really? Did we need more of that? -Certain transformers get way too much screen time -Sam screams ""BUMBLEBEE!"" and ""OPTIMUS!"" The entire movie -Worst plot devices ever used. -At one point Sam's hand gets magically bandaged and there's no explanation behind it. -Horrible Dialogue, and terrible story. As you can see, there are way too many minuses. I left A LOT out, but hey, don't take my word for it. I didn't buy any stock in what review after review had warned me about. I saw it, and this is one time I do agree with critics. If you want to have your mind numbed and your ear drums blown, then by all means this is the movie for you. If you can't sit through 2:40 minutes of nothing happening (except in the middle and end of the movie), and want something more, then skip this terrible excuse for anything resembling a movie. I'd rather watch Wolverine again.",0
45,"Michael Bay strikes again. Again and again and again and again.For this review, I am only going to say four words: Noise. Confusion. Megan. Noise.That is all this movie is about. There is not much else to say. Transformers 1 was pretty decent for a horrible director but this is a piece of one big **** Nothing about this movie was good. Not even Megan Fox because she cannot act. Shia LeBeouf looks neurotic, the Transformers look like trash toys now, and the story sucks. Michael Bay, you have failed...for the umpteenth time.",0
47,"I hated this movie! HATED,HATED,HATED,HATED,HATED THIS MOVIE! IT'S GODAWFUL! IT'S A CURSE,I MEAN IT IS SO SAINT IN HELL! Michael Bay destroy this movie and raping with lots of sexuality and some stereotypes in this horrible movie! HATED!!!",0
48,"If you liked this movie, then what the **** is the matter with you? You must be a ****ing idiot to like this piece of **** I already ****ing hate you if you like it. **** Michael Bay, **** Shia Lebeouf, **** Megan Fox, **** Spielberg, just **** everybody that had anything to do with this **** Even a pizza guy. **** THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!",0
49,"There are so many flaws with this movie i wanna put a knife through my chest.  But ill kepp it short.Its boring, not about transformers, and horribly acted and directed.And finally the made SOUNDWAVe a SATELITE, that in its self is a sin.",0
50, I'm being nice giving this a 2. Only because of the somewhat impressive Visual Effects. It's most likely the worst film on 2009. Anybody that would rate this film a 7 or higher is either a child or incredibly stupid.,0
51,Bad storyline. Decent to bad acting. Horrible storyline. Even the special effects (which really aren't that good) can't save this one.,0
52, If you didn't like this movie there is no hope for happiness in your life.,1
53,"An absolutely horrible film. Michael Bay should be ashamed that he isn't capable of toning down his over-the-top action, concentrating a LITTLE on the story and, when doing a film marketed to kids, leave out all of the sex, drug and racist material.",0
55," A blast from start to finish. Intense, brutal, massive, lasting mech batles with outstanding sound audio and video effects that build upon it's predecessor. A must-see for any transformers' geek and a pretty entertaining movie for any other kind of geek or action movie fans.",1
57,"Revenge of the Fallen continues the movie franchise as the battle between the autobots and decepticons continues. This time, the leader of the fallen plans to take over our world as the autobots once again need the help of Sam Witwicky once again to help them win the battle, but after Optimus Prime gets killed by Megatron, now resurrected and is tracking Sam down to find the Matrix of Leadership which it has the power to resurrect a prime and our heroes must somehow save the world once again.My friend from school showed me the trailer and I waited until June of 2009 to see it and I've finally did.Michael Bay's directing was good, The storyline was almost slow, but some of the scenes were well-paced like the storyline from the first movie. The cinematography and the actors were almost as good, but they were still entertaining, again, the Witwicky family weren't given enough screen time, but were still great. The action scenes were amazing and the humor was as good as the ones in the first.This movie had won some of the golden raspberry awards, but the negative reviews and the score are way too low for a great movie and one of the highest grossing movies of 2009. If fans of the franchise hated this film will have to deal with the director. Remember that.At my highest hopes, an 8/10 will make this movie a very good sequel and I'm going to see Transformers 3 tomorrow in theaters.4.0/5 stars",1
58," First, I believe the transformers franchise is amazing because of how live;y the machines are and the ability to become any of earth's technology. The second installment of transformers was amazing form the beginning to end. And yet it got such a horrible review. The story line of the movie is more action pack than that of the t.v series. As many of us know, the matrix was a important item of the series. Michael Bay turned it from a bad ass story line of primes fighting on of their own and protecting it to optimus revealing it in the transformers movie (1986). It deserves a ten and two more movies featuring the dinobots.",1
59," This movie was better than the original. Yes it was super Bay-tatstic over the top action... But thats what this movie IS, an action movie with giant robots. All the stupid cheese humor was (mostly) cut out this time in favor of slightly more adult themes. And the few scenes that I thought were going to just be horrible turned out well. See it if you like: Giant robots, Action, Optimus Prime shanking Decepticons, Megan Foxx and mostly adult humor.",1
60," Critics, obviosly still dont seem to release what average people like, evryone likes the tear jerkin stories that have an Oscar winning plot, but the average person also needs the thrill and excitment of intense movies like transformers, well i admit its not as good as the first, I still give it a ten though because everyone other than the critics gave this movie a 7 or /10 and anyone that comes to this site will be turned away from this must watch.",1
61," Loud, Spectacular, Dumb and Fun - everything I wanted from a Summer Blockbuster. People need to get a grip and stop bitching that a Michael Bay film is too loud and too over the top - it's what he does and what he does well!",1
62, Seems. To me every low score on here seems to have michael bay mentioned so my question to all you baqy haters out there is this.sense you most likley knew bay was at the helm of this movie and you think he is satan then why did you even go to the movie? Guess you all showed him you know by handing over your money.anyway great movie as long as you know what your going to be seeing witch is insane bot battlles explosions and great cgi,1
63," The most amazing film I've seen in ages - ignore the bad reviews from critics justifying their job - if you simply want to be entertained and amazed, go see it.",1
64," Dont listen to the critics, this film is awesome! It had loads of laughs and an overflowing bucket of action! The fight sequences were incredible, the attention to detail was improved. I dont think ive ever come out of a cinema with my jaw hanging, until i saw this. It is seriously good! Whether your a transformers fan or not, if you love movies with some butt kicking ass action of the highest calber, see this!!",1
65," Again i do not understand how could the critics not like the movie. Is it because of the incredible graphic effects ? Is it because of Megan's hotness ? because it sure isn't because of the acting, nor the storyline. Everything was fantastic and another job well done by Michael Bay and the crew. Well done.",1
66, A $200 million opening weekend shows what people think of the critics. Great movie!,1
67,"WHY?! why does this movie have such bad reviews? This movie was epic and amazing. I know it was rushed because of the writers strike and all, but this is Transformers. Anybody watch the original cartoon? It was cheesy, had cheesy humor, but it was awesome, best show ever. This movie went back to the original cartoon with the comedy and action, and the on-going rivalry between Megatron and Optimus. This movie even had soundwave with Ravage too. I am an absolutely diehard Transformers fan and whoever gave this movie a bad review is just blind, deaf or plain old stupid, because this movie was epic. ALOT of action, traditional Transformers story, and good acting from Shia Labeouf, yes I know Megan Fox is a terrible actress but shes absolutely beautiful. Thats mainly what shes there for. This movie was amazing, funny, and EPIC! I love Transformers, I can't wait for the third! 100/10!",1
68,"The story was weak and the humor was just plain silly. But having said that, it is one of my favorite movies. Here's why. The presentation of this movie is flawless. The action is perfect and dazzling. Explosions and metal pieces galore. Many scenes, especially the forest fight scene, play out like a symphony orchestra. So what this movie lacks and screws up, makes up for it 100 fold.",1
69," I still dont understand how people could hate this movie. The first time around everyone complained that there wasn't enough screen time with the bots. Now everyone complains that there were TOO MANY bots and it was too long and too loud and too much action. Get a grip and enjoy the movie for what it was, just a fun movie where bots are kicking the living crap out of each other. The dialogue reminded me of the old 80's cartoon show with some of the stupid lines and things like that. The movie was completely nostalgic! And the too many bots problem? Well remember in the old cartoon how a bot would be introduced but NEVER seen again? C'mon people!! If your a fanboy you will love this movie, if not whatever go be miserable somewhere but this movie absolutely rocked! Cant wait for Transformers 3!!",1
70, Awesome movie is 2 1/2 hr but it really worth it i will go to see it again.,1
71," It's not the great American movie experience, but it's an amazing summer action blockbuster.",1
72," Outstanding summer movie, it delivered what every great action movie should. explosions, babes, comedy, and a fun filled roller coaster ride. As an adult watching a movie about an animated series from my childhood, i was absolutely pleased with the outcome. To those overpaid film critics who are so far detached from anything resembling reality (other than their own where they sit around with their narrow minded friends and congratulate themselves on how great they are), Hey lighten up. I would say go to the movies and have a little fun and TRY not to overthink every little thing, but i think they either don't know how, or are just too stuck on themselves to lower themselves to anyone else's level.",1
73," Great movie! If you liked the first movie, it was equal or better. The robot fighting scenes are much better this time around, and the special effects are incredible.",1
74," It was exactly what I expected, and unlike those who say they can't keep up with the action, I was easily able to differentiate the robots in fighting sequences, and the move came off with a hint of more store and a desire to know more about the universe. I think people that hate on this move need to remember that we love action movies for the action not acting.",1
75," Tranformers 1 was a superb action film! Transf. RotF=Trans1*10! Everething everywhere is blowing up, more jokes, more transformers!!! Fantastic film! The best action I've ever seen! Michael Bay! We need moooore :) Can't wait for Transformers 3!",1
76," Yes it´s story is, reduced to it´s essence, a flaw. Yes the movie is a bit too long. and yes the movie kicks ass! Transformers 2 is Blockbuster Cinema par excellence! Loud, funny and enjoyable in every second. It´s a feel good movie and even better than the amazing first part. Definetly a must see!",1
77," As expected, low scores.. i dont know what critics are looking for in the movie, but whatever. its their opinion. i thought it was really entertaining, engaging thruout the movie. and some reviewers dissed the slang-speaking autobots, wtf! this movie is meant to be funny+actionpacked, thats why they put it there! dont listen to the critics, watch it. i've watched it 2 times now.",1
78," This movie was great to me, i mean some, well most people say its too long, but the dark knight and titanic were too long. and i hate long movies. but this one is an exception. most likely if the movie is long, then it is boring, but that is the oppisite with transformers 2. this movie had so much action i had to wait to go to the bathroom because i didnt want to miss any of it. yeah half the jokes were bad, but half were also very funny. would u rather it just have boring parts instead of comedy... i didnt think so. i dont know why critics hate it, but its their job to do that. but that didnt stop the movie from grossing over $200 million in its first five days. and people came to see this movie for one reason, action and adventure. so just because some of u little wimps cant handle all of the action doesnt mean u have to give it bad reviews.",1
79, I thought that this movie was funny as hell cuz every body in the theaters was laughing like hell and wen everybody came out of the movie they were still laughing there ass off.,1
80, Who cares what the critics like and dislike. Its what the audience like what should count. If a critic jumps off a bridge it doesnt mean im going to do it too. This movie was action packed and entertaining. PERIOD!,1
81," If I had to explain this movie in one word I guess it would be....jawdropalicious. There are mixed reviews for this movie and thats because of all the 29 yr olds still reading their comics in mommy's basement who think the movie changed a few things. Well answer me this: would you want to watch a movie that you know exactly what is going to happen? My favorite movie possibly of all time with not one thing I would change. Don't ask me though, go see it for yourself. It is a must see on the big screen.",1
82," Wow! I just saw this movie and afterwards came here to see the score and I couldn't believe what i saw. This is the maximum that today's action cinematography can give. The peak of computer technology paired with attractive real shots, with crazy tempo...and with comedy elements and....everything! Action movie that fulfills its main purpose - to entertain people. I am getting this on Blu Ray ASAP.",1
83," If you think that ""Transformers REvenge of the Fallen"" was great you are may be right.This movie has gotten better than the first movie which was a great summer blockbuster film the first movie made than 700 million dollars that was impressive this movie has made more than 800 million dollars that was really super impressive.See you guys later 4 the 3rd Transformers film fools.",1
84," Great movie, i loved it, dont care about whom was a better actor ? Its entertainment, I enjoyed the loud Bass and tremble at the Rave. Funny movie and action was Awsome. Its better than watching Postal or Blood Rayne from Mister Bowl Himself. Imagine him making Transformers. Oh the Horror.",1
85," I loved thi smovie, as did my wife, it was what Transformers was all about back in the day, not this new age PC crap! Suprise, critics don't like it, well duh! They only like garbage! Loved it!",1
86," My friends and I went to the midnight release and we had the time of our lives! The movie was amazing - and the special effects were mindblowing! You critics need to grow up and learn to relax! Just because it's not ""Brokeback Mountain"" doesn't mean you have to try and run it into the ground. Just watch the box office numbers...the FANS will show you what a good movie we all thought it was!",1
87," Transformers revenge of the fallen was great. i thought that Michael bay out did himself on the first but the graphics, storyline, and and music(linkin park_new divide) was excellent i cant wait to see the next yes for those of u who have not yet seen it there will be a 3rd but slow your horses its not coming out for years to come.",1
88," I'm done with these idiots who can't appreciate a good - nay, AWESOME - movie that delivers exactly what it promises - record-breaking action sequences and CGI only Avatar could hope to match. I didn't see any multi-story mech in Avatar that caused a computer to FREAKING MELT trying to animate it. I'm even willing to give the Twins a little leeway, as their lines were apparently the actors' ad-libbed own. Finally, it started back up my unhealthy habit of trying to find ways to put money in Hasbro's pocket by buying the damn toys. I'm counting down eagerly to the War for Cybertron game and TF3 (422 days as of this writing!).",1
89," It is very hard to beat the first movie in a sequel. Transformers 2 doesn't quite match the first one but it is never the less a great movie. The special effects are outstanding and despite some big name critics rubbishing it about ""no story line' and ""too long"", i personally found it enjoyable and very entertaining, in fact i lost track of time during the movie. The only indicator i had that the movie was a long one was my backside going numb from sitting in one spot for too long in a worn out movie cinema seat. Can't wait until the next one comes out!!!",1
90,"What is wrong with the critics in todays society?! I realize movies like this may not be their favorite, but they should take into consideration all the work that goes into a movie like this rather than if their cynical selves enjoyed it. The funny thing about critics is that they always have biased reviews based on a single thing they dislike and then it sways their opinion and in turn outweighs the movie as a whole.  They should appreciate the talent required to make a movie like this. This movie got an average that was one ppoint higher than Dance Flick.... Are you kidding me. I got back from the midnight showing a little bit ago and it was phenomenal..... Don't listen to the critcs.  They will all go to hell with the sound of their voices.",1
91," The best word to describe this movie is EPIC. There is no way you can sit in the audience and watch robots the size of skyscrapers fighting each other and not get caught up in the action. The movie dazzles you just because it knows it can and leaves you wanting more explosions, more gunfire, and more giant robots getting ripped in half, impaled, or imploding. Don't expect to find some deep movie here, this is a pure action joy ride that needs to be experienced to be believed.",1
92," I thought it was great! C'mon people, you're not going to Transformers for a great plot....",1
93," LOL!!! How can you give this movie 0 points and call it the Worst Movie of The Decade? T4, a movie that has most likely killed the Terminator franchise would deserve that title way more. But back to Transformers...Yes, it was long...Yes, it was cheesier than a quadruple cheesburger...Yes, the predictable plot that snuck in between the action scenes was mind-numbing...and Yes, I definitely expected all of that. They could have had Megan fox running in slo-mo for 2 and a half hours, I would have liked the movie. Even if the robots would have fought for 2 and a half hours without saying a word...I still would have liked it. It simply was what I expectd and in terms of flawless special effects, it gave me more than I expected. Not being a Transformers fanboy I would have liked the Decepticons to look a little bit more different, I kept being confused who their leader and who his stupid F-14 side kick was. Anyway...great summer movie, more face time with the Robots and Megan Fox make this definitely a better experience than the first one...go and see it and never trust the Rolling Stone magazine again ragarding a movie rating...0 points...absolutely rediculous!!!!",1
94," This movie was really good, CGI was out of this world. I'm glad they put more well known and oldschool transformers like Devastator & Acree. Also I'm glad they gave Starscream more dialogue too. I wasn't too pleased with how pussy Starscream was with Megatron and I wasn't pleased with Megatron not being called Galvatron after he was revivied seeing as thats what happened in the originals. However they did give Megatron his oldschool 'tank form' back. Demolisher was NEVER supposed to be that big, that was ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous, Megan Fox's acting was terrible and her char differed from TF 1. Shia was perfect as usual, and Optimus Prime... wel he just made me remember why hes my fav TF and the most badass TF ever! Rly good movie if ur not a TF fan either! Screw those 'professional' movie reviewers they don't know TF like i do.",1
95," Highly entertaining movie. While it isn't a cinematic masterpiece, the ""professional"" reviewers are either too old or too pretentious to appreciate this kind of film... I'd consider it a must-see in theatres.",1
96, I liked the movie and if u grew up with transformers u will love it too i saw this movie twice in theaters and the critics got it wrong. Just look at the money that has been made and that should tell you that people like things critics dont.,1
97, Horrible movie. Is shit. Rolling Stone is right. 0 out of 100.,0
98," Honestly, If it weren't for the Mechanical details of the robots, I have not even bothered to watch after seeing the first movie, which was really boring, but after watching this sequel, it made me take back what I said.",1
99," The critics are lame dickheads!! this was a great movie, sure the plot wasn't that great..who cares!! the action was the best part..this movie is overly hated, and deserves a 9.",1
100," Transformers 2 is not as serious as the first, and being as the first wasn't very serious, well that says a lot! However I really enjoyed this movie, its the first time in a while that iv'e been in a Cinema where the audience have all started applauding at a great joke/scene. It has some terrible scenes, but it also has some superb ones, and overall its a fun film. Go see it if you want a fun, cheesy, un-serious action flick. Don't expect in-depth story lines or a life changing film, just go for a laugh and you will enjoy it!",1
101," Almost anyone can rant about how bad this movie is because it lacks this and that but in the end, I don't think anyone goes to watch it because of it's storyline or good drama scenes. It's about the action and the massive robot fights. If you can leave your logic at home you will enjoy this movie a lot. The only important complain I have about it is that it centers too much attention in humans when It's called Transformers and is based on a series where the main characters were the robots. Megan Fox acts bad... but she looks really good doing it.",1
102," everything was perfect, except the the ending. The final fight between the fallen and optimus prime could be a little bit longer.",1
103,Fantastic movie. everyone did a great acting job. Megan Fox was beautiful!,1
104," The women reviewing this movie must have been writing their essays for school, while us 18-35m were off in imaginationland wondering what these toys would look like in real life. Keep making these movies and raking in the cash from all us guys, and let the critics go back to reviewing the chick flicks they are so good at reveiwing.",1
105," I don't understand all of the bad reviews out there. If these people came to the theater expecting a rich story, good character development and plot twists then they obviously don't know transformers. Its autobots vs deceptagons, that s it. there will be alot of fights and alot of explosions. What more do you need from a summer action flick. its not a suspense thriller.",1
106," Wow! I just saw the movie Transformers: Revenge of the fallen, and the critical reviews are mostly way off in left field somewhere. I can't believe the reviewers actually saw the movie based on the reviews. This movie rocks. Never trust a review based News Paper hacks. This movie was really entertaining with lots of action, comedy, and human emotion. No complaints here. I highly recommend seeing this film for the fun, laughter and action.",1
107," Extremely entertaining action, and hence is not made to be taken seriously and scrutinized, but simply enjoyed. Great characters and stunning visuals. This year's best action.",1
108," This SUMMER ACTION movie was fantastic! It's not an Oscar worthy film, nor is it some historical piece where it takes itself too seriously, so to the critics who bang on this movie, you need to get back to picking apart those boring dialogue heavy movies. Transformers 2 was funnier with way more action than the first Transformers. The plot was not hard to follow despite the critics being confused by a simple plot. Get over yourselves critics because summer blockbusters are like microwave dinners, you can't expect it to be restaurant quality. Finally, to the person who thinks this movie will outsell Dark Knight and Titanic.....YOU NEED TO CHECK YOURSELF!",1
109," Loved it. its exactly what i wanted in a movie. something to take me away. I suppose if I was a movie critic and al lI did with my life was watch movies, or was some netflix snob wannabe-critic) like some of the sad people who trash this movie, ok maybe i'd think different. But to your normal person who has a job and just wants to be entertained... this was purely fantastic.",1
110," No where near as bad as everyone makes it out to be, its just a good old action filled movie for your entertainment not to make you think about whats happening and its not trying to be a masterpeice!",1
111," I LOVED THIS MOVIE. Unlike others i went to see the movie for entertainment. There was more action and i saw none of the so-called racist undertones, that people are claiming, it is 2 1/2 hours of FUN!!!",1
112, Critics don't know anything Transformers was a good movie and if critics think that movies are bad doesnt mean that we think its bad.,1
113, Best movie I've seen in a very long time. Very exciting. Audience was caught up in the movie and I found myself cheering many times during the film.,1
114," This movie deserved nothing less than 100(or more) out of 100! It was absolutely phenomenal! Ok fine maybe some parts of it could of been tweaked just little tiny bit but how much more are you going to ask for?!? In my opinion, best movie ever made. The only thing that might top it are any other sequels they might make. Anybody that has anything negative to say needs to shut-up and get a change of thought.",1
115," It was a spectacle, something that stimulated every sense. I couldn't have asked for anything more with second installment!",1
116, Great brill movie could see it 100 times and wouldnt become boring!acting 10/10 graphics 10/10 are the critics blind this is a master piece for your eyes go watch now1.,1
117," Its funny, most critics panned this film but what we must all remember is that they don't matter. I don't mean that in a bad way. its just that take into account cinematography, how good the actors were, all that stuff, and its still a personal opinion i.e. ""How was this film to me"" therefore it doesn't matter what these critics have to say. We didn't elect them, we didn't get to decide who they are. They just decided to do this job (and then worked towards it, not saying you can just decide to be a critic one day). That's why all these audience surveys have been counter to what the critics have been saying. I enjoyed the film. I though it was enjoyable funny and all round good and apparently so did most of the people who saw it. In the end that's whats important with rating a film.",1
118," Great movie!!! I enjoyed it from the 1st min to the 147th min. I went into this movie not expecting anything. I wasn't expecting TF2 to play on my emotional connection to the toys/cartoons/TF1. I went in wanted to see a great Transformers movie and that's what I saw. I never read anything about this being a movie for children. With saying this, if you took your child to see this movie and were offended that it had profanity, it's no one fault other than your own for not seeing it was PG-13. What concerns me more is the fact that we have professional critic (meaning people who get paid to script their opinions about a topic) only give this movie a rating of 35/100 while they gave Hannah Montana: The Movie a 47/100. You have failed at your job and your life. You have personally misinformed everyone with your limited comprehension of what aspects go into making a great movie. What were you looking for in this movie, what were you wanting to find and last what movie did you watch? Now do us all a favor and never post your opinion on a movie again.",1
119," It was a great movie. There was nothing really wrong with it, but it was long. Still, everything worked nicely, and it had tons of action.",1
120," I thought it was a great movie, funny, action packed, and a good length not too long and not to short.. I would watch it twice before leaving theatres.",1
121," Are critics seriously getting paid for what they do!? WTF is up with them? They're literally a bunch of the stupidest dumbasses in existence. This movie had everything from comedy through to action (+ megan fox ;P), and is even suitable for all the family. I watched it with all mine and we all loved it!",1
122, I loved this movie!! Those critics that rate it so badly ad ppl with really bad taste are truly the reason that the Academy Awards aren't even worth watching anymore loaded with bore and WTF-was-that-movie-about-again moments,1
123," Why did a whole bunch of critics hate this movie? It was really awesome. The first one was good too, but Revenge of the Fallen was even better. I think Transformers 2 has a shot at the thitle Best Movie of All Time.",1
124," I don't see what was wrong with this movie. Seriously I thought it was fun, cool, and explosive. The plot was good, maybe a little to much characters but who doesn't like seeing robots kicking each others butts. If you haven't seen the movie you should see it. You'll have a lot of fun.",1
125, All these critic opinions are worthless. This is an awesome movie. Already watched it twice and about to put it in again. If you're not a sissy and like action this is a must see.,1
126," Simple explanation for the 10... way too many trolls on here who obviously were not going to enjoy the movie. If you didn't like the first movie, hate Michael Bay, don't know a thing about Transformers, and are looking for a Golden Globe plotline... why in the world would you go see Transformers 2?? Stay at home, or go watch My Sister's Keeper instead, sheesh!",1
127," I rate this an 8, but the total score really needs to be brought up. This movie was fun, well done, and a must-see for any fan of the first film. I don't understand all this hatred coming toward it; especially scores of 0. Even if you hate the plot or script, it should get at least a 5 for the amazing special effects. Every transformation is a wonder.",1
128, Amazing VFX. It's Fun to watch. The story is confusing. But it's worthy! I give it a 10/10 though!,1
129, It's action packed with a vast amount of scenes that force your eyes glued to the screen!! Bay did an incredible job of balancing the action with the story line and really hit the spot on this sequel. just amazing!!,1
130," A very intriguing sequel to the first hit film. Some will complain that the action is overbearing, but they severely overstate the intensity.",1
131," This movie was not only better than the first, it is the best film I've seen in years. Better than ""Sugar"", ""Star Trek"" & ""The Dark Knight"". What more could a Transformers fan ask for. If I had any complaint, it would be the unstable or shaky camera work in the heavy action sequences. I would have also liked to have had Bumblebee talk. Thank you, Michale Bay for not ruining one of my favorite storys. He dose such a good job, that I couldn't help but be disappointed by ""Dragonball Evolution"". A horrible attempt at bringing an excellent story to the live action universe. I am planning to see Transfomers 2 again, very soon. Loved it!!!",1
132," This movie was awesome. I don't understand all these people having trouble with the plot. It was funny, full of action, and by far the best movie of the summer.",1
133," I actually would have to rate this an 8.5, but im going 10 because of the people voting this down. This was a fantastic movie, very epic, with some of the best CGI to date. the plot was surprisingly good. a couple qualms I have with it, are the fact that they didn't actually develop and of the new transformers, or have any of the existing ones like Ironhide do a whole lot (other than fight), meaning they didn't have plot purpose, I wish they fit them in better (both new and already existing). ***slight spoiler***, Blackout and a couple others that are assumed dead in the first are alive in the 2nd... I guess we just have to assume they were revived. Ending leaves it open for another which is always good. Overall, the movie had a lot of funny parts to it surprisingly. Action is great, although there are a couple segments that are slow and tend to drag on, but its tolerable. Defiantly a must see and must buy when it goes to dvd/blu-ray. I do believe the first film was slightly better, but this film was still great plan and simple. Its a great film to simply just enjoy and laugh, cry (there actually are some pretty intense emotional scenes), and be on the edge of your seat in anticipation. I plan to see again as soon as possible.",1
134," If your are looking for some philosophy threre, there isn't any. If want to watch metal robots then it's perfect!!!",1
135," X-men, Spiderman... and other superhero type films based on magazines or toys try to take themselves seriously end up being poorly executed. Bay has taken something light hearted, added good humour, a non-too-serious plot, Megan Fox and some cool effects. It makes for one totally mangled amalgament of awesome for the simple minded. Turn your brain off and this film is superb",1
136," Are you kidding me - a 42?!!! And a 6.1 from Users?!!! I'm not sure what movie these people saw, but if you liked the first movie, then prepare to be blown away. This sequel puts the original to shame. Of course nothing can compare with the first time I saw Optimus Prime transform on the big screen, but the friend I saw this flick with at midnight put it best: ""There is more action in the first 5 minutes of this movie than in the ENTIRE first one!"" Wow, these numbers would normally make me question everything, but not this time. While I might be slightly delirious from the lack of sleep, I know what I saw. Simply the most technically advanced, everything on the line, action packed, comedic, and well-plotted movie of the year. The things Bay does in this flick will make your jaw DROP! Go see it, then come back here to review and bring the numbers up for a film that just made my top 10 of all time...",1
137," A great summer movie. If you come into the theater knowing you are going to see a thoughtless action flick, you will have a blast. If you didn",1
138," If you like the first movie this one is even better! It was full of action and suspense and of course Megan Fox! Bay has made many improvements on the fight sequences, gone is the shaky camera and close-ups, now you can actually see the robots destroy each other without feeling sick. There is also many new and awesome robots that will make you laugh and cheer. I dont understand why everyone is hating on this movie. So what there was 2 ghetto robots how is that racist, they are robots! I believe if you find that racist and stereotyping than maybe YOU are the ones who are racist considering one of them was actually played by an african american who play a great part in coming up with the characters. Please stop nitpicking people! Just go and watch it and have fun!",1
139," You know what to expect when you see a movie titled ""Transformers."" This movie delivers on wow factor and entertainment quality, which make it the perfect summer movie. Little lengthy but necessary to develop a second storyline around aliens that turn into machines. Definetly worth price of admission.",1
140, This was probably the best one yet.the acting was amazing and then there was all the action.this movie was just pure dopeness.,1
141," Despise wat all the other comments i think this movie was ahhmazing.i know the sex scene in the beginning with the dogs but it made it funny.the two twins were hilarious and the theatre was full of laughter.the cussing made the movie all the more funny granted the robots cussed like sailors,but it was hilarious,the only problem i had with the movie is how did they not get kicked out of college for missing so many days.i think all the action was just ""wow""i wasnt excited to see the movie but when i came out of the theatre i talked nonstop about it.i had to go to the bathroom about an hour into the movie but i held it in the movie was that amazing.i think it was at just the right length.in general this movie was dope!",1
142," Although the storyline not as good it should be, but i like the special effect and i the size of the robot. it huge man.",1
143,"I don't know what the hate is about. Sure the plot was a little disappointing, the acting was sub-par, but as a old-time transformers fan, I have no issue with it. The expectations were set way too high when the movie is intended to give good special effects and action sequences, and that's what Bay is good at, and that's what he delivers. Personally, I think if you want a touching plot, Oscar-level performances, go see a movie that actually looks like it's going deliver. If you want explosions, mindless action, and an entertaining two hours, I recommend this.",1
144,"From the first frame of LOUD METAL-CLANGING CONFUSING MONTAGE to the last frame of LOUD METAL-CLANGING CONFUSING MONTAGE this film is Michael Bay as usual: terrible, but loud and fast. The actors literally try to dash out of the wreckage and no one's career gets out unscathed.  By the time LeBeouf outruns (!) the enormous, fast as jets, body-heat seeing BOTS for the tenth time--one wonders how ANYONE maintains any respect for this disaster. Moviemaking at its crudest. Ugh!",1
145,"Explosions , Stupid Jokes explosions. I Liked it Once One Time. However The 3rd installment seems prommising",1
146,"There was a point in this movie where me and my friends looked at each other and just started laughing uncontrollably. This was because the movie in front of us was so preposterously horrible that  you couldnt tell what the F was going on. I just look up and theres a lizard robot scaling a pyramid. Then I look up again and theres a giant alligator that breaths in dust for 5 minutes basically against both sides, just breathing in sand , that is his function in the movie. then we walked out. this movie is a disgrace to the world.",1
147,one of my favirote movied ever . the critics are morons when they diss this movie. it funny action filled and above all entertaining.as i always say robot violence is the best violence this movie proves that fact  as you can see all the parts coming out of the the robots when they are shot also they look like they are real life robots as they are so realisitic. ok so maybe the plot is simpilisitic but i hate over complicated plots.also the script is hilarious whith many good jokes.,1
148,"There is just no way to defend or salvage the massive and overblown mess that is Revenge of the Fallen, the sequel to the equally big but not equally bad Transformers film in 2007. Clocking in at two and a half hours, this is a drag and then some, with an uneven and completely exhausting plot that twists and turns into senseless action, it becomes quite difficult to follow and, well, unnecessary. To many devices, turning points and pointless additions make up this bloated sequel, where we find Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) now heading to college, but being dragged back into the fight of the Transformers. The Decepticons, or the bad guys, have found a new energy source, and it's location lies within the mind of Sam, and that's really the plot that drags out for an obscenely long time, and the humour and mediocre storytelling, it goes one way by the Decepticons reveal themselves the world and how they will no longer hide, but yet their epic showdown happens in the desert, away from the.. erm.. public eye. These ongoing problems persist throughout the film, as the script seems to contradict itself at many turns, switching locations and using cut-off scenes at what are perceived to be  pivotal moments such as the resurrection of Megatron, but lets cut to Sam's parents trying out snails in Paris. The inconsistencies simply don't diminish, whether its these symbols that are the driving point of the film, why exactly where these missing from the first film, with only subtle hints that never amounted to anything. The humour can be the saving grace of the film, but low and behold we have teo particularly stereotyped Autobots who are now part of of Optimus Prime's  team of earth dwellers who are reminiscent of the gang culture persona of African-Americans, racist and desperate are words that spring to mind. We also have new lady autobots who I'm sure have around five words to say in the entire film, its been made big, but just too big to point where there are mistakes and forgetfulness.LaBeouf continues to bicker his way through his lead role, perhaps trying to encapsulate a character with an attention disorder. There is very little do to for the rest of the cast, some having petty one-liners while others are kicked to the dirt entirely. The special effects are again a truly amazing to watch, but a compromise needs to be drawn somewhere, and there is none in this film, its loud and utilises slow-motion so we can watch Sam and Michaela (Megan Fox) run away several times, and leap from buildings onto piles of rubble without any sort of injury.There is no consistency, motive, relatable actions or fluid plot points to admire this film, instead we are left with a loud and over-arching catastrophe. Michael Bay should have listened to the dialogue that John Turturro delivers on the film, ""beginning, middle, end, plot, condense  If only.",0
149,"I suprisingly enjoyed this film a lot more then the first one. I think the huge flaw for it was the long run time, It definently started to push your nerves while watching it. The run time dragged the film on longer then what it should have. Besides that, The acting was fine (yes, even the super hot Megan Fox was alright in it) and the story was fine as well. The special effects were about the same as the first film (good but insanely repetitive) and I agree that it did seem a lot of things were being blown up for no reason other then blowing them up and hoping people think it looks cool (it doesnt). It was annoying seeing the transformers transform 15+ times in the film. Also the action sequences were terrible and didnt have any excitement, Also it was hard to tell who was battling who when the camera is so close up and the autobots and decepticons are so large. Overall the film was still rather good and I enjoyed it.",1
150,"I loved the first movie and this sequel was almost as good. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox are great once more, as is the rest of the cast. There are a few issues that I did have though. The number one problem I had was believing that transformers can now replicate human beings perfectly? I didn't read the comics or watch the TV shows so if there's anything in them can gives reason for this I wouldn't know but I don't care. Good movies should be able to stand alone and I have a hard time understanding how transformers can replicate, not just the look of a human, but also the texture of skin, personality, smell, etc. That was just a short segment of the movie so I can't count it against it too much but it still bugged me. Also, why are there way more Decepticons than Autobots and why are the Decepticons always cool things like fighter jets while the Autobots are relegated to various Chevrolet cars and a semi? These things didn't hurt the movie at all it just seems unfair to me. Nonetheless, it was once again an awesome movie with fantastic action-sequences, witty dialogue, solid acting, and an interesting plot.",1
151,"The new Transformers, sorry for all the people that love this movie, but is the worst of Transformers. The special effects can be amazing, but no all be special effects. The soundtrack is good. The cast have some regular moments. The story is great. The screenplay terrible. But what is the problem? No be one, are two biggest problems. First, the development of the movie is same like the first, much explosions, and yeah autobots that say bad words. And the other is that the autobots don't be the most important, is Megan Fox!!, yes people, Michael Bay do this like Megan and the Transformers, because all the story is about the stupid relationship of Shia and Megan, and the Transforers?, no, no this movie is really bad.",0
152,"Goog movie, memorable scenes, good cgi, and explosions, but felt like  somenthing was missing, and too goofy i mean... devastator has balls?  analphabet autobots? really Michael Bay? that really killed the epicness",1

155,Racist unfunny so much worst than it's previous movie. It's an insult at it's finest. Words cannot descibe how awful this movie ugh. Worst than pixels and that's saying something. OK I need to get this movie out of my head like now,0
156,"Revisada esta segunda parte de la saga ""Transformers"" tengo pocas cosas que añadir con respecto a la primera entrega. Muy buen entretenimiento. Yo me lo paso como un niño pequeño viendo destrucciones, acción y efectos especiales. Es mala, muy mala en cuanto al guión, desarrollo de los personajes, se saca cosas de la manga cada veinte minutos. Pero yo creo que esta película se la toma a risa el propio director, y se ve en muchas fases de la película, muchas veces se rie del americanismo, entre otras cosas.En definitiva, poco que añadir. Muy muy muy entretenida las 2 horas y media se pasan como 1h y 20 minutos, y por lo tanto, lo que yo espero de esta película me lo da con creces y la valoro por lo que ""espero - me da"" que es DIVERSIÓN a raudales.",1

160, Completely over the top and shamelessly marketed towards teenage boys.,0
162," Oh, lord. Just what the world needs. Yet another movie about robots fighting robots and decimating prime real estate in their scraps. I can't wait for ""Rock-'Em-Sock-'Em Robots: The Motion Picture.""",0
163, In my opinion it was an epic summer block buster seems people dont listen to what robots say because the main compaint is why do they teleport. answer is they use space bridges. why dont all the other transformers have it? in the story line optimus said there planet was destroyed there for they lost the tech to do so WATCH THE CARTOON.,1
164, The critics are being too critical of a fun movie about robots! Come on let people sit back relax and enjoy a bad ass sci fi spectacle!,1
165," There's so many things to complain, but i'll just go ahead with this one. Most of the decepticon are just duplicates. Watch closely and you noticed the robots that's got killed before keeps coming with just a different color, head or something. We're not dumb, Bay.",0
167," Absolutely stunning movie for my wife and myself! I myself was a fan of the original Transformers, though admittedly not as big as I could have been never fully watching or reading any of the series, and my wife was never into them or saw anything of them practically at all. We both agreed that the movie was good though. It was fast paced, which apparently must have lost most critics I guess, because everyone seems to think their was no plot. We had no trouble with it though, and it made for such an entertaining movie, neither of us wanted to get up to use the bathroom. I thought there was a lot more Transformers action in this one, which was fun. I didn't have trouble distinguishing the bots like most critics seemed to, though admittedly it would have been a 10 in my book if they had simply gave them a little more time to get to know a couple characters in full like we do with the twins. It seemed to me that a lot was given to characterize robots. People also seem to complain about the twins being racist, but I didn't see it as racist until I heard critics arguing about it. I see plenty of kids acting like that, and believe me, it's not limited to Black, Hispanic, OR Caucasian people. It's just a dialect becoming very ambiguous between gangbanger types of all races, so why does it have to be racist? They're robots. They aren't any color but red and green. The notion that they're a black stereotype is only in the minds of the viewer, which is where the racism really lies. I also thought the treatment of the human-sided plot was interesting and playful. It's a shame most critics think so poorly of the fanservicey moment of Megan Fox's character at the beginning, though they seem to take that moment and blow it out of proportion. If you only read the critics (which I did before seeing it so expecting it to be very sexist) you would get a completely different idea of the character then what she was. The movie had a comic-book styled idea on sex appeal, with the sexual tension on the surface instead of what most movies fall to nowadays, simply having a full on sex scene right out of a porno. Great movie!!",1
168, The worst movie of the 21st century.,0
169," I missed the part where Sam revives Optimus with the shard he carries around with him the entire time. Thus cutting the entire plot of the film. Tell me again? why does he revive a strange Decepticon instead? Oh! great film making bay, I love the angles where the Autobots are in the shot as a car. And sit there saying and doing nothing while the humans determine their fate. Last I read Autobots wern't P*ssy hippies trying to protect all living things.",0
171," Michael Bay's tautological exhibition of the decade's best eye candy on the silver screen, also, Michael Bay shows his brilliant storytelling skills that keeps the audience soporific until the very end.",0
172," Worst film I've ever seen, under-plotted, weird, the characters act completely stupid, especially skids and mudflap and wat too long.",0
173," The worst film I've ever seen!! i don't know why any would like this. it's stupid, under-plotted, the characters are retarded, way too much sexual references and way too long for a film like this!",0
174, Excellent action scenes and good music!!! -1 because of the love story (it's always the same thing when they can only say the L word at the end).,1
175, Horrendous nonsense. I feel like tearing my eyes from my face just thinking about this abomination.,0
176,"It delivers what it promises. loved every bit of it. My only problem with the movie is too much of robots, we can't distinguish good from bad ones. I liked it better than avatar anyway.. Hope next one is 3D.",1
177," The movie was a really good thing to me because i pesonally love Transformers, and some of Megan Foxes cleavage. And I also LOVED the fact that there were twice as many transformers in it such as the Arcee twins, The Fallen, Sideswipe, and Jotl (the one who links up Jetfires heart to Optimus). What I did't like though was the story was relatively confusing. It added up but it was confusing. Similair to a math lesson not yet learned. But the graphics are good, the transformers are awesome, and Megan Foxes boobs are huge. Thats my rating.",1
178," Michael Bay is the the worst director ever, this film is so awful that to find any redeeming qualities is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. No plot, racist stereotypes, inane and awful acting, fart jokes are about the most sophisticated humor you will find here. So if you like shutting off you're brain and watching robots fight and things blow up for 3 hours of you're life, then watch this movie!",0
179," Oh sure, it was devoid of cutting edge story. But, anyone who gives this film a poor review probably never took a basic college writing course. From watching this film, I can tell that it is designed to be a mindless joyride. I therefore rate it based upon its ability to be a mindless funfest. These poor reviews come from people who want a good story, they want this, they want that... movies can only carry so much. Bear in mind that pros created this movie. If they wanted to convey another aura, they would.",1
180," Well, seing as I have neither the patience nor the time to really get into all of, well, everything, let's start from the good and move to the bad, shall we? GOOD: -Bay /actually/ included 'Bee, whom I adore with every possible inch of my innerself, and so scream every single time I see a Chevy Camaro in real life. -Whoa, they actually made a second movie. -I liked seeing all of the new characters, and contradictory to what everyone esle says, I didn't mind Skids and Mudflap that much. But perhaps that's just because fourteen year olds act like that most of the time. So that means most of the kids at my school do that as well. -I loved the action, although sometimes it began to be overbearing. BAD: -What the hell ever happened to the Secretary of Defense?! They made a big deal of all the government security efforts in the first movie, leading up to a sequel, then TOTALLY DROP ALL OF IT?! What?! -They made Obama look like a doofass. Wtf?! But, then again...they made Bush look like a doofass in the first movie, so I guess it makes up for it. -Four words: Not enough robot scenes. It was mostly humans. Um, Bay, last time I checked the movie was called ""Transformers"", not ""Aw Look at Sam being socially awkward at college *angstemoangstangst* and Mikaela acting like a total slut! :D"" Yeah. I just said that. -I was /actually/ looking forward to seeing 'Bee a lot in this movie...-obsession-...and I barely got to see him. What's up with that?! -Let me just quote someone from a review I read once, ""Bay might as well have made a movie about Mikaela's bouncing tits, and it probably still would have sold just as well."" ---Sums in up in one sentence. Mikaela, please, put your shirt back on and quit getting boob-jobs. -Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew. I think I speak for the over ten million emetophobes out there when I say, ""What the fuck is up with Sam randomly hurling in the library?!"" Did that even have a real purpose besides make me reconsider my popcorn buying habits? What about those sympathetic vomiters? Do you think I /really/ wanna look over and see someone puking in the middle of the movie? Nuuu. -Why Bay? Why? I was actually happy for like, the three minutes that Sam was dead. And, hell, even though I love 'Bee, I LOVE that expression that came across his face as he dropped to his knees in sorrow and disbelief. Absolutley amazing. And so why is it that it's impossible to find that clip? I think that sums it up for now...so...thus my horrid rating. It wasn't worth going for all of the things Bay did to fuck it up, but it was worth going to satisfy my Transfomers fix that I'd been having for about three months prior to its release.",0
182," I will agree with Peter Travers from RS, this movie is only robots, explosions and confusing battles, the only reason it became a box office hit it was because everyone wanted to see Megan Fox. After all, who the **** would see a movie about a toy line?",0
183," I didn't finish the movie, I walked out 1 hour into it knowing there's 1 and a half hours more of this garbage. If you're gonna make a bad movie make it short so the viewers might at least consider finishing it. I could have fallen asleep even with all the loud explosions because I was bored to death. You could edit out 1 hour of this movie and then make a sequel to ""Not Another Teen Movie"".",0
184," I wasn't expecting much, but I still ended up being disappointed! I decided to give it a chance, thinking to myself ""How bad can it be?"". Boy, did I regret that decision. It was a terrible movie! Convoluted storyline, no real plot to speak of, overly loud, cheesy, cringe-worthy 'humour', bad acting, no character development. The story didn't even make sense. It's like they created one big explosion sequence, then tried to build a story around that. The duration is too long and drawn out unnecessarily. The only saving grace was the special effects, which were okay.",0
185," Are there things wrong with this movie? Sure. But not a whole lot. These awful reviews are killing me. Transformers is meant to be FUN, and I could not have had a better time at Revenge of the Fallen. The explosions, transformations, and fight sequences are top notch. And Shia Labeouf takes himself seriously, giving a legitimate performance. The complaints I've heard are that there's no soul or heart to this film, and it's just not true. The battles are amazing, but there's plenty of emotional moments in there as well. This is easily as good as the first film.",1
186," Humorous, loud, long, thats what this movie was created for. Sure, Transformers 2 wasn't the best, but it was worth it as a summer movie. It's all you need for a perfectly fine time at the movies.",1
187, Please oh God someone pass a law banning Bay from making any more movies!,0
189," It was amazingly action packed and I cannot get enough of Megan Fox! Except for Shia, the acting was horrendous but that was expected. The 1 hour climax scene was a little bit annoying, but all in all I had fun.",1
190," Great sequel to the first, for sure. The beginning is very well done and super awesome to watch as you watch all the bots in action. Drags in the middle and the finally is great but sort of leaves a little more to be desired; but it's definitely much better than the reviews are saying it is. What are you waiting for? GO WATCH IT!!!",1
191," If you love huge action, great special effects, amazing stories, interesting characters, wonderful acting and clever humour...then go see something else. If you are of low intelligence and will watch any old drivel for two and half hours so long as it has some explosions and hot chicks then you will lap this up.",0
192," Garbage -- please do not see this movie!! We need to stop encouraging Hollywood to put out mindless schlock such as this. Contrary to popular belief, a film CAN actually have REAL production values and be entertaining. The Dark Knight, while not the best movie ever, was still fairly coherent, it was well shot, had some good writing and acting, and was still a huge summer blockbuster and was monstrously accessible. Transformers 2 is pure garbage, plain and simple. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about it. Michael Bay ought to be working at a gas station if he is half as dumb as his movies let on. Please, go see something else this weekend. Go see Up, or Star Trek, or heck, just watch some paint dry, it will be more intellectually stimulating than this steaming turd.",0
193, My kids hated this movie. They looked excited while watching but I was just bored the whole time. No movie with that much cgi should be that long. After the movie was done we walked and they both hated. My daughter liked it a little better than my son but for the most part it was all a huge disappointment.,0
194, This was a horrible movie. And what was with the twin robots that cursed all the time because supposedly they were black so of course as a black robot you must curse and say bit** and sh** every five minutes. I think it was suppose to be funny but the movie sucked so much before that I was numb so I didn't get very mad when that came around. Definitely deserves a zero.,0
195,"Transformers 2 gives you everything you would expect from a Michael Bay directed movie based off a action pack cartoon. Remember people that's what it is. It is suppose to be Loud, Action Packed and crammed with as many Decepticons and Autobots you can think of. If you were expecting something else you should have seen the movie. Turn the brain off and enjoy the simple CGI Robot Battle Royal smashup!!!!",1
197, Summer blockbusters should be a movie that majority of the public can enjoy. Watching T2 feels a lot like watching Bad Boys 2 in terms of explosion & intense scene but lacking on storyline progression. I think with unexpected success of the first movie the director feels why not make it bigger & badder & rake in more money just like waht Dead Man chest had achieved. Clearly this movie was not made for the critics so I would rate it higher as a normal moviegoer.,1
199," It really is a poorer movie than the first, with bay directing what would you expect, the first movie was the fluke in bay's nauseating movie curriculum, but, nevertheless i will give it a high score, My reason is simple, most critics don't know the the animation series' story, including jetfire the lost transformer, devastator, the matrix, starscream's cowardly acts! We have to realize, this storylineless movie, is supposed to be just that and the action and CGI is really is all a transformers fan is expecting. What's next? Unicron?",1
201," Seriously, how can you go into a movie based on a cartoon with such high expectations for character development, plotline and ""beautiful cinematography"" which seems to be all that is needed for a good score these days. Transformers 2 doubles the action and despite some fairly erroneous and somewhat distracting errors in both story and effects creates an amazing experience. I don't recall Transformers both now and during the original cartoons run ever being about the story. It was always second to the eye candy of big guns on big robots. The movie delivers that and more with the added bonus of two total hotties for at least the first 30-45 minutes of the movie. Once people go into a movie expecting more than it needs to deliver, people go on a bashing run around the Internets and through the press. Its sad that films like this which are pure brain candy are treated like they might be the next Ben Hur and subsequently fall short.",1
202," Dialogue was much to be desired and Megan Fox's character was almost completely pointless, but, I will say that I loved the plot line and the CGI was spectacular.",1
203," Could have done without Megan fox, she had no clear purpose or any real script other then pure sex appeal, like the Robot says in the movie she's HOT but not to bright. There is a plot to the movie ** SPOILER ** Fast plot, Descriptions are trying to find a key to unlock a machine to harvest the suns power to make energon to populate whats left of the fallen that encountered humans long ago. , the problem is it will leave earth without a sun. both long ago and now had fights over it to save humans. not the best plot but its still a solid story. the movie could have been 30m shorter then it was but it want horrible.",1
204,"Never in hisotry has a statue been erected in honor of a critic!  One of the most thrilling action movies I've seen in a long time. All the bullsh*t is coming from Michael Bay haters, and you all forget Bay does one thing very well: Balls to the wall action. The plot is simple, the autobots are compelling characters, and the combat scenes are riveting to say the least. The middle of the movie slows down a bit and I was getting worried about half way through that it would drag, but in the end it builds up wonderfully to a great climax and a spectacular final battle. If you were a fan of the original cartoons, this movie will not let you down. Don't listen to the critics, and don't let any contempt for Bay ruin the movie for you. All around great summer action movie that will not disappoint.",1
205," The movie has moments of brilliance, however these are all but lost a in a mediocre and overly drawn-out plot, which is more heavily punctuated with juvenile 'humour', racial stereotypes, and lame attempts at action- even the biggest fight scenes were boring.",0
206," Great action sequences with some of the best cgi effects I've seen in a while, audio is jaw dropping. However the plot has to much in common with the first one (find a 'sacred' artifact and use it to end the war) which I found was alright but some may not like it",1
207," Before you dismiss me as another Michael Bay hater, please read what I have to say. Yes, the movie is bad. Really bad. Unless you're a 10-year-old boy, you seriously are going to want to skip this one. And that's a hard thing for me to say considering I saw the first one and found it pretty entertaining. I mean it's at least worth seeing for the cool special effects and Megan Fox, right? Wrong. Listen to me: I paid to see Armageddon and Pearl Harbor when they were in theaters. I own copies of The Island and The Rock. I walked out of Revenge of the Fallen after 2 hours. I'd ask for my money back if I thought there was a chance I'd get it. Speilberg produced this crap? Come on, Steve! Did you read the script or did you get a tax write off for hiring the mentally challenged?! Absolute garbage. Peter Travers just scored some big points with me for telling it like it is. TV Guide, whatever the studio paid you, it isn't worth it. Bottom line: the movie is crap.",0
208," As a huge major hollywood director, Michael Bay seriously looses touch with this movie. More so than the first transformers movie, it really lacks intelligence. Does the man even know what suspense is? It barely has a begining middle and end, which is torturous to say as this movie clocks over two hours. It was excruciatingly painful too watch, even with the added 10mins of slow motion megan fox!",0
210," Enjoyed it, going again with my wife tonight.",1
211," Optimius Prime FTW! Seriously, if you go into this movie expecting some great dramatic presentation, you're not only dumb and miss the point of the film... but you're dumb and miss the point of the film. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a massive movie that is designed to be nothing more than an exciting presentation of impossible situations accented by massive robots blowing crap up and some cleverly humorous dialogue. There are plenty of throwbacks to the classic series, which is a plus; but overall the movie is just about large scale fun. I enjoyed it immensely.",1
212," This was just one long transformer fight and after 2.5 hours, it got boring and tiring. The story line was stupid and so was much of the acting, especially Sam's mom. UGH.",0
213," The only reason why someone would think that this movie is good, is if they had watch it once and was in shock Once you watch it more than once, the special effects don't seem that good, and then you realize how bad the story is. Overall, this movie is decent if you watch it once Anymore than that and you are just going to be bored and hate the movie. And to the other people who are not critics but think they deserve to post on a critic site, should learn something about good movies (Godfather etc) before judging something they barely know anything about.",0
214," This movie is not perfect, but it was enjoyable. I was not a huge fan of the first movie and I was expecting to come out of this one feeling the same way. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie was actually a bit better than the first (from the perspective of a huge Transformers fan). I've read through the reviews on this site and have noticed that most of you disliked the constant comedic relief. After seeing a number of Summer blockbusters, I've trained myself to just ignore the comedy bits. If you can do the same you will enjoy this movie for what it is: robots fighting robots. The fight scenes in this movie were much longer and more prevalent than in the first, which is probably why I liked this one more. One particular battle in the forest towards the middle of the movie really won me over. The story in the movie, while weak, is really no more weak than the story of the first movie. A giant machine threatening to destroy the Earth is no different than an ancient Transformer relic threatening to destroy the Earth. One thing to note about the infamous ""Twins"" was that they were definitely racist stereotypes; however, I noticed that the only people laughing at them in my theater were the African American family behind me. If that family could enjoy the movie despite the ""racism,"" I think a lot of other people can as well. Needless to say, I doubt The Twins will be back for number 3. If you're someone who can overlook a lot of cheese and just focus on the real point (robots fighting robots) this movie will please you. If you need a story that could win an Oscar, please skip this movie and don't bother reviewing it.",1
215, I wish there was a minus zero selection on this thing. The worst picture ever from the worst Director/Human Being ever.,0
217," Dirty Jokes and Explosions. That's all this movie is. There aren't 5 minutes of story that makes any sense in this movie. THE GOOD: Megan Fox runs in slow motion. I don't know what her character's name is though. She's just Megan Fox running in slow motion. Why is she in the movie? So she can run in slow motion. There's a good fight between Optimus and 3 Decepticons in a forest. THE BAD: The story makes no sense whatsoever. The action is so convoluted, you can't tell who is who and there are just a bunch of explosions. The jokes are recycled, racist, sex or drug related, and too adult for kids. The first 45 minutes of the movie are mildly entertaining, then takes a 90 minute break and becomes utter crap. The final transformer battle is about 20 seconds. It's one of the worst movies that I've seen. I'd give the first Transformer Movie a 7. This one, a 2.",0
218, I loved this movie it had a bit of everything in it just like the first. I will agree there is some thing that really did not fit but hey I am still hoping for a 3rd edition.,1
219," Micheal Bay should be shot. I just got back from seeing this with my best friend, and cannot properly express in words how bad it is. It was long as hell, and about 2 hours of the 2 and a half was just padding. There are far too many comic relief characters that serve absolutely no other purpose, multiple plot holes, not to mention the smallest and most drawn-out plot ever concieved by anyone. The ending seemed thrown together in minutes, tying up loose ends at the last second. Do something better with your time. Worst movie I have ever seen.",0
220," This movie was horrible. Most of the things that happened in it contributed absolutely nothing to the plot. The plot being, bad guys want something, good guys have it, good guys win. The jokes were all not funny. Generally consisting of something humping something else or something said in a black stereotype. It was excessively long and for the first hour almost nothing happened. Sam went to college for a day, only so the movie could add another comic relief, of which there were already too many. I'll give the movie the fact it probably has some of the best SFX to date, but that's all it has. People that enjoyed this movie are racially insensitive, mindless fools who think a movie is amazing because of ridiculous amounts of fighting robot scenes.",0
221," I walked out after the first 45 minutes. i enjoyed the first movie but found this movie laced with racist and sexist stereotypes. The movie has no heart. If you like movies that require very little regarding the thought process, well this would be your type of film. However if you want something that shows more than dogs humping, racist comments and slang and certain groups of people reduced to negative ideals that exist in the minds of idiots, well this is your movie. Overall, good special effects but a really bad movie.",0
222," If you want a film with large plot holes, lack of any emotional attachment to characters, and 2 and a half hours of mind numbing colors and explosions, then this is the film for you. Sure the CGI was amazing, but that doesn't cut it unless you're a 12 year old fan boy. A waste of my money, and more importantly a waste of my time.",0
223," Without any doubt this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I give it this accolade because never before in the history of moving pictures has so much money been thrown at a production and so little of merit achieved. The humour is infantile in the extreme, repetitive gags that fall flat, foul language, offensive racial stereotypes, pointless sexual imagery that adds nothing, a completely nonsensical plot and so called action scenes that are badly staged, too reliant on flashy CGI and completely without emotional impact. The critics are right, and remember that these people are judging this based on their experiences watching hundreds of other movies. Transformers ROTF simply isn",0
225," Critics suck, this movie is action packed and very entertaining. Wasn't as good as the first one in my opinion but still awesome. I wouldn't recommend this for kids due to some perverted humor and unneccesary bad language.",1
226,"I was laughing all through the movie, but not at what Bay was hoping I would laugh at.  This movie was a poorly planned, poorly designed, poorly executed mess.  One would expect more character development in the second movie, but they were all more stereotypical and cliche than the first movie (read:  ""blackface"" robots).  Further, Bay blatantly ripped off sci-fi classics rather than come up with his own ideas.  Megatron and the Fallen are basically Vader and the emperor.  Then there was the Terminator ripoff taken to a ridiculous tongue-weapon extreme. This is not even to mention the elementary school plot and the god-awful acting!  I would have given the movie a zero rating, except the effects and action sequences were pretty cool.  This was the only thing that made the movie even mildly entertaining.",0
227," When a movie has to repeat its' title 4 times during it so that you can remember what's going on... it's not a good sign. Bad acting, horrible script, and just a bad movie.",0
229," This was the most boring action movie I've ever seen. Worse than ""Fast & Furious"" I wish the pathetic director had put more plot in this piece of garbage.",0
231, LOVE both Transformers movies..Shia LaBeouf is AWSOME...Can't wait for the 3rd movie to come out!!!,1
232," In spite of my well-informed tuned-really-low expectations, it was still excruciating to sit through. 2.5 hrs was needless for a plot as thin as this.",0
234," The guy from Rolling Stone clearly doesn't know jack about what fans of this genre want. 2 and a half hours of giant alien robots beating crap out of eachother ? Megan Fox in short shorts ? Seriously, what's not to like ? As an old school Transformers fan, I found that this film delivered far more than the first, more characters, more funnies. My only real complaint was that there weren't more recognisable old characters. Jetfire was a welcome addition, but I'd like to see Ultra Magnus, Galvatron et al. But there's plenty of time for that in the 3rd installment. bring it on!",1
235," Sure there's not much deep plot, but too many people are jumping on the bad bandwagon. What you go to a transformers movie for is the transforming, the explosions, and the massive shredding of decepticon metal. If any of these critics had to review the original transformers, they'd probably give it a horrible grade. Shame on this movie for giving us what we want from it!",1
236," Two words sum up this film, utter crap. Save you dollars. Don't even rent the dvd.",0
237," Incoherent and amateurish. More like a 2 1/2 hour demolition derby than a movie. A plot stolen from your stereotypical ""You cannot defeat me haha! Only a Prime can haha!"" Japanese Anime beat-em-up. Oh yeah the twins clearly are racist. Dead give-a-way are the big Obama ears (from political cartoons) and when Shia says the line ""Don't pop a cap in me alright?""",0
239," Watching the first Transformers movie about 5 times should give you an accurate idea of what watching this movie is like. Honestly, this was one of the worst movies I have seen this year...a complete waste of time. Honestly, you can only watch giant robots beat the crap out of each other for so long. At 2.5 hours this movie was painful to watch.",0
242," This movie actually made it boring to sit through 2 and a half hours of an action movie, and you couldn't even tell whats going on when the robots fight.",0
244,"A million times better than the 1st movie. If you go to a movie based on toy robots fighting one another expecting to get some of the best acting, and directing, theres something wrong with you.  This movie was action and comedy, just like the corny cartoon series. Everything a Transformers fan could ask for.",1
245," Sell out. Very poor. As a fan of the first movie, i feel cheated.",0
246," I went to Transformers expecting a god awful movie, thanks to the harsh reviews from critics everywhere. All I can say is that they really need to lighten up. If you are going to see this movie expecting an emotional outing, a well driven story, or a tried and true Transformers die-hard loyal movie, you will hate it. However- go to see it for what it is, a fun summer flick, and you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit. It's a summer movie- it's just for fun. Don't go LOOKING for a bad movie or that's what you'll get, go with an open mind and what you'll get is a fun summer movie that's not too shabby.",1
247," Nothing needs to be said about how terrible this movie is, every already knows its a pile of crap made to look like a gleaming golden monolith through the use of special effects.",0
251," You have to know what you're about to see when you watch a movie from a critical standpoint. So, when you go to see Transformers, please don't expect deep, thoughtful dialog nor a perfectly planned and executed plot. Do you really expect those from a movie called ""Transformers""? What you should expect, and what I expected, was some cheesy dialog, a disposable plot, and some awesome action scenes you won't see in any other movie. The scale of the Transformers was absolutely huge, and the moments(abundant, I might add) where there's a ton of action on screen make you sit back and think, simply, ""Awesome!"" Definitely a sight to behold on the Imax screen where I saw it. So really, this movie accomplishes what it's trying to do. Go in with an open mind, let the plot breeze by, and enjoy the fact you don't have to put much effort into enjoying this summer action movie.",1
253," Everything a summer movie shouldn't be. iron man did it right last year. it was fun, had great action, and it made sense. transformers is a mess. please vote with your dollar, don't go watch this type of movie and maybe one day Hollywood will wise up and deliver more good movies.",0
254," Since I've paid for the ticket, i might as well stay til the end, but if anyone asked me to watch it again, it's a NO! Skid n Mudflap fights over nothing-crashes into the wall-voila!!-there goes the matrix! wth!!?? love bumblebee tho'.",0
255," It was an enjoyable movie, well sorta. The explosions and action were nice, but the plot was predictable and full of plot holes, big ones. If you pay attention towards the end the giant green dump truck is part of the big one and also fighting the humans on the front line. I was like wait a minute ",0
256," I think this had a better story than the first movie! It was fantastic, when I was expecting craptastic.",1
257, Sorry this movie sucked i mean the acting was terrible and there was a over use of cgi i understand that this is a action movie but it had no human touch. i liked the first film but this one is just bad. The reason this movie made a lot of money proves that there is a lot of dumb people in the U.S.,0
258," Again, the only things worth watching in this film are the robots, the transformations of the robots, and Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. (Sorry Megan Fox, but your poses and pictorial shots in this film are not worth watching, since we're here to watch the Transformers, not you.) All other aspects of the film, especially the storyline and the characters, are just toilet paper. This one is actually worse than the 2007 film. If you want a good story about the Transformers, and also if you want to see how Michael Bay just lacks originality and maybe a rip-off artist, watch the 1986 animated film ""Transformers: The Movie"". After watching it, you will know what I mean.",0
259," This movie was great, but a little too long, better fights, more robots, and less humans(although, still too many humans!) overall not as good as the first, but still a good popcorn summer action movie. on a side note people who are saying that the characters of mudflap and skids are racist should be ashamed of themselves, the characters are obviously URBAN stereotypes, but not of any particular race. don't turn this into another phantom menace!",1
262," I thought this was a great movie. Yes, the plot wasn't too great, but since when was Transformers known for its plot anyway? It was a fun and exciting movie that's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.",1
263," Look I'm a huge Transformers fan and I loved the first movie. The second movie was actually better in a few ways and significantly worse in other ways that the first one. I won't get all long-winded but basically it comes down to this. It's good that there were more robots and the action scenes were actually pretty impressive. The thing is there were actually TOO many action scenes near the end and it really just kinda got numbing. I actually thought the story made perfect sense. It actually seemed like something that would be in one of the cartoon episodes, for better or worse. But the human parts were just horribly done for the most part. Everyone did a decent job acting, especially Shia, except for Megan Fox. God she cannot act. I'm sorry, for all her good looks, she just can't. The score also seemed less inspired, but maybe it's just because the action was so loud without any sense of dynamic. Still, I enjoyed it enough. Nostalgia played a big factor and I realize it's actually even barely a ""good"" movie, but it was fun and I'll probably enjoy watching it at home. It think the people bashing it and many posters here are really exaggerating its negative aspects. Which is sad, because it's not an awful movie, it's definitely flawed, but it's still satisfying to me. I can get my high art elsewhere but sometimes I just wanna see some pyrotechnics. Finally, all you all who are saying that the twins are racist need to get a clue. They were imitating urban street slang and emulating styles they downloaded from the Web, as goes the plotline of how TFers learn to speak. If you think that the way they're talking is talking ""black"" or that they are ""blackface robots"" as others have mentioned here, then I think that says more about your views about race than the film's intentions. One of the voice actors was black and the other was the guy who voices SpongeBob. And THEY came up with their approach for the characters, NOT Bay. And those are the facts (not something that is often given much value on the Web these days...).",1
264," This movie wasn't as bad as the critics say, but not quite as good as some fans say. It was a fun ride, and while plot was thin, it WAS there despite some scepticism from critics. The twins weren't racist, unless you look at them that way. Plenty of people from several different races talk like them. The sexual innuendos and the language did through it off a little for me. I lost respect from Sideswipe as he announces, ""Damn I'm good"" while looking a little ballerinaish. If anything, this movie is a great distraction from life, albeit it's very long and hard to sit through 3 times, which I had to do. See it once and decide for yourself.",1
265," Why can't bumbebee talk? he isn't the silent character that annoyingly plays clichés from a radio. The writers promissed that these Bots were the same 80's versions in new skins. Sorry but they aren't. Also great work on Arcee, I've always dreamed of a motorcycle that could turn into a stick with some skates.",0
266," wow it took two Transformers movies to get one scene where robots are talking to each other, and no humans are present. If you want to see a great Transformers film watch the cartoon movie. at least they gave a d@m about the licence & history.",0
267," I challenge someone to make a movie more boring than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen! Come on, I'm waiting! This movie will give you a headache and make you sleepy, so if you want to see this movie you should just pocket your money and bang your head against a wall until you are no longer conscious.",0
268, Could've not seen it and been much happier. At least an hour's worth of the movie could have been cut. It was repititious and hard to follow at some parts because there was too much going on at once trying to be crammed in.,0
269," Love Transformers! but unfortunately this time around, i actually fell asleep for a bit, and the part that i was looking forward to, was Soooo disappointed when they made my favorite Transformer Soundwave into a big fat sattelite robot. :{ the rest of the movie was okay, nice action scenes, the writing was soso, got a bit too cheesy at times and Megan Fox, wow beautiful girl but i got sick of her lips and her empty stare.",1
270, It was awful.,0
271," I should be giving this movie negative 5, also i can not comprehend why people are giving this 5 to 10. come on all of you moronic homunculus. is it really that bad to be honest with yourself.",0
273, This movie was awful. It was so bad Forrest Gump even gave it a thumbs down.,0
274," it was ace, big robots kicking the crap out of each other what more do you want from a movie about toys. its not ment to be a masterpice just fun and thats what it was!",1
275," Not nearly as bad as the critics make it out to be. Yes, there are lots of loud explosions. Yes, it probably would have benefited from a shorter running time. Yes, Megan Fox's only purpose is to look hot. Yes, there are plot holes and very bizarre sequences...such as when Jetfire blasts open the side of the Smithsonian Air Museum out by Dulles Airport in NOVA and inexplicably ends up in the boneyard at Davis-Bontham Air Force Base... So what? The movie promises to be louder, bigger, and better than the original and for the most part it delivers. It is funny, dramatic, features battles and effects of epic proportions and only gets slowed down by occasionally pointless subplots (love story) and some ill advised character creations (Skids and Mudflap) But, it delivers what it promises and looks great doing it. Criticizing Michael Bay for making movies with lots of explosions and bad character development is beyond redundant at this point. He has given fans two movies that faithfully deliver awesome transformations, transformers true to their animated counterparts, and a story mirroring and paralleling that of past incarnations. It's a movie released on a large scale with an accompanying large budget that caters to the hardcore fanbase. The fact that it does this, rather than changing things for wider appeal (cough...Xmen)...makes it a movie that people love and critics hate.",1
277, It wasn't a bad movie critics are being a bit too harsh on the film i watched it with my family and I agree it doesn't live up to the first transformers movie but still I had fun for about 2.5 hours.,1
278," Anyone who gives this film a score of 8, 9 or 10 doesn't have a brain. This is quite likely the worst film of the whole decade. I just can't belive some critics have even rated it above 50%. Dumb movie for Dumb people!",0
279," Hey, just want ot say that this movie is awesome! Got everything you need: Lot's and lot's of characters, funny scenes and best of all: robots! Hell yeah can I get a high five here or what? Wooo! I mean who doesn't like to laugh every few seconds with overused comic reflief! 'splosions man! It's just..it's just...why? How could I do this? I've created a monster! This movie is terrible! Take this as a formal apology to fans everywhere: I have wronged you and I'm sorry. Your truly M.B.",0
280," This was a really good movie. This one is better than the first, which was also very good. It had very good visual effects and action sequences. The climatic battle is more dramatic than the one in the first. Megan Fox is hot and Leo, Sam's college roommate, is very funny. Mudflap and Skids were also funny with their vulgar sayings.The first hour had a good pace, but after Optimus Prime was killed, the film started to slow down. Still, I liked the movie. I can't believe critics hated this one! Sure it's not the best plot, but to me, the action, visuals, and humor made up for it. Can't wait for Transformers 3 in 2011!",1
281, Almost as good as the first one! if you liked the first one don't let the critics scare you away!,1
282," Not this time, the first film was more on the edge compared to this.",0
283," Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is nothing but Michael Bay's abnormal obsession puked out onto the big screen. This movie is nothing more than flashing lights and screeching sounds, and that makes just as much sense as the plot. There are way too many characters introduced including the Jar Jar Binks robots who are nothing but stereotypes. From what I can tell of the plot, they have to stop the Decepticons from blowing up the Sun. Something like that.",0
284," How could a such a great movie like transformers have produced such a terrible craptastic sequel? The plot is terrible and there is about 50minutes worth of pointless dribble, cars on highways, and slow motion running that could have been cut from the final product. This movie is a clear example of the bad side of hollywood movies, when sequels are made just for the money because people will go see it just because of the name.",0
285," Ok, this movie is horrible, I say that for many reasons as a long time transformers fan, i got really hooked and into the first movie, i even followed along with the storyline as it progressed after the movie in comic book form, there series emerged to give the reader more insight on the story at hand & the titles were 1.The Reign of StarScream 2.Transformers: Alliance 3.Transformers: Defiance now after reading all three, and basically have a complete understanding of whats going on and how the second movie starts of at, i was pleased but when i went to see the movie, it was truly a horrible experience, they didnt bother to use alot of the story arc's they set up in the comic's rather, the movie focused on horrible humor, and WAY TO MANY sexual situations/inuenndos, for crying out loud why did they put Wrecking balls to act as a Scrotum for Devastator, & Why did they have Wheelie hump Megan Fox's leg when Cybertronians dont even have sex?? Also, Jetfire, they created his character with the premise that he is a very old, ancient cybertronian, but they ""again"" with all the horrible humor, had him walk around with a cane?, and his pieces fall of his body as he walked around, they revived him with the AllSpark sliver, but its still a fragment of the AllSpark, and that in itself gives them life, so this is just simply a ridiculous venture in the movie. There are so many issues about this movie, but its to much to add here, i give this movie a 2, because they showed a very done fight between Optimus & the 3 Decepticons, but only because it was very nice eye candy, If Optimus had a hard time facing off against Megatron in the First, how he could hold off Him, StarScream, & Blackout (The Helicopter) is a pretty huge inconsistency in the Story line yet again",0
286," A fantastic, funny and f***ing action packed film, packed with great action, jokes and acting. The robots are bigger and shinier, and the explosions are bigger and more um... explosive. bit it is a great film.",1
290, Very corny and lame movie. A lot of scenes just felt completely out of place. No plot. They tried way too hard with the special effects to the point that scenes just look bad / very fake because they tried to do too much. Would not recommend.,0
291," Easily the worst movie of 2009. Zero script. Zero acting. Zero character depth (I'm referring to the Transformers - although the human characters were quite superficial as well). In terms of presentation, the CGI was also dreadful. I couldn't tell who is who since the transformers look almost identical to each other. Even worse, they all just look like a pile of cogs, wires, and bolts. Pretty awful design... A film needs first and foremost a good, solid, coherent script. The rest come easy and natural once a good storyline has been established. The biggest mistake of Transformers & Transformers II is that the Transformers are playing supporting roles while Shia LeDouche and Megan Faux are the main characters. There are two major flaws with this : 1. The movie is called TRANSFORMERS !!! Which means humans are optional and even if their involvement is deemed necessary, they are ultimately unimportant. For example : Who cares if LeDouche goes to college? Why should we care? WHY? What if he had gone fishing? Would that have any effect on the movie plot-wise? What if he had gone to Las Vegas to gamble and party with prostitutes? Speaking of prostitutes, why is Megan Fox dressed like one? This is supposed to be a movie based of children's toys! 2. LeDouche & Faux cannot act. That is a fact, NOT my opinion. Neither of them can act. Period. The bad humor, the cliche and insulting stereotypes, and especially the nonsensical plot completely destroy what could have been a nice, enjoyable movie. It's sad that people like this $200 million crapfest. It wasn't entertaining even a bit. Transformers II is not worth neither your money nor your time. My advice : Just stay away from this movie.",0
292," I can't give this a perfect 10 because there was a lot of adult-natured humor in it. There was some swearing, which would not be proper for kids to be exposed to, but overall, a good movie. I know many people are overly critical of Michael Bay, but if you can't keep up with a fast-paced movie like this, then you're better off with romantic comedies. The action sequences, in my opinion, do a decent job of depicting what a real transformer battle might be like. The Decepticons are just about as ruthless as the terminators in Terminator:Salvation. As far as entertainment value, I loved it.",1
294," EW (Glieberman) and SF Chronicle have it right (as usual). I'm annoyed by how a lot of these reviews read. What are you expecting from a Transformers film?! If it's action, excitement, special FX, eye candy, light humor (i.e. lowbrow entertainment) you will be very pleased. If you're expecting an art house drama with some profoundly moving subtext and a well-developed plot/characters you will be disappointed. You have to view this film subjectively. It accomplishes EVERYTHING it sets out to accomplish! Enough of the hating. Not every film is trying to be the next Citizen Kane. Just exercise some willing suspension of disbelief and have a good time!",1
296," Tyler, I saw this movie, and I believe, as you do, that some of the comments ""voted the movie down"" (as did the movie itself). To provide some counterweight to those people who in my opinion voted the movie too highly, I am giving it a 0.5. Hope the score (a score, at least) is settled. I might have been even more fairly score-settling had I actually bought my economy-size bottle of Tylenol Rapid Release gel caps with me to the theater.",0
297," The people who gave this movie 0's are bunch of Michael Bay haters... this movie does not deserve 0 and for everyone who's watched the first movie and thought that the movie lacked in action battles between robots, well he answered to his fans. This movie is great and filled in the gaps that the 1st one could not deliver. Plot is decent but c mon... its transformers, did you really think the plot of these type of movies will be top notch. Give me a break... haters be gone.",1
299," Boring, too long, too loud, too much BAY! Someone please tell Speilberg to drop this guy, I was under the impression Speilberg was a story teller, but Michael Bay has no clue how to tell a story. Worst film of the year and racist with it.",0
300,"People rating this down are crazy. All the reasons i see for this movie being sub par are just ridiculous. Get a life. This was a fantastic squeal and if you're on the fence about seeing it, trust me and just go watch it. Fantastic special effects, an aqueduct plot, explosive fight scenes, and amazing comic relief. This movie does all the first one did and more.",1
301, This movie is only loud war and breasts. The sequel is even worse than the first.,0
302," Putrid, juvenile filmmaking. Really, couldn't it have been an hour shorter? and what's up with all the shakey cam? Stick to music videos, Bay!",0
303," A turkey, plain and simple. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I am a Transformers fan. If you enjoy watching one of the most epic 80s franchises torn down with juvenile humor inserted every single chance they get, then you'll enjoy this. The only redeeming qualities are the special effects and the likenesses of the Transformers. ****SPOILER P.S. To give you an idea of just how horrific it is: the movie features three separate scenes of small animals and even a transformer humping legs, midget humor, several instances of testicle jokes, and Devestator has visible testicles. In addition, one of the new additions to the Autobot family are a set of twin robots that, as near as I can tell, are either racist portrayals of black-face actors or a satire of the mentally handicapped. Yes, it is that bad.",0
304," Great movie! An improvement over the first one. Plenty of comedy in this to keep the movie length bearable. Outside of couple of slow parts and a bit of corniness, this was well worth the price of admission if you go into with realistic expectations. If you enjoyed the first one, you will love this one. Only downfall was a bit more cursing, which makes it questionable for young children, but just fine for teenagers and adults.",1
305," Did not like. Megan Fox and Shia LeBeouf are poor actors, and Michael Boy is a poor director. Awful storyline and acting does not make up for the insane CGI and special effects in the movie. Damn you, Bay.",0
306, My kids loved it. Not quite as good as the first but still great entertainment and an escape from everyday life.,1
307," Can somebody please tell me where the Michael Bay off switch is located? I didn't understand the plot, but that's only because it was so badly told and the characters were nothing more than poorly written stereotypes and window dressing. I want to see a movie about giant robots, I don't care about goofball college kids, hot chicks, school boy soldiers and racist mini bots. Transformers 3 should either not be made at all or be given to a director with more than one trick up his sleeve.",0
309," Overall quite good, about on par with the first one. The fight scenes are still cluttered messes but a little more coherent this time and impressive. The story isn't excellent but has a good pace and plays off the cast's strengths. That being said 1. the previews/commercials spoiled too much 2. i could have done without the toilet humour, and most of the scenes involving sam's parents, sam's dogs, and about half the scenes involving sam in the first hour. 3. adding almost a dozen supporting characters without really introducing them and generally just creating space filler on screen.",1
312," This is a perfect summer movie. Cleavage, explosions, wrestling robots, and potty humor. I loved it. To all the reviewers who think otherwise...calm down, think back on what you used to think was cool before you became jaded, and watch the movie again.",1
313," Hey, I like explosions and humping jokes as much as the next guy, but even I need a little bit more to justify shelling out $15.",0
315," You get to see optimus as a complete bad ass in this one unlike the last. Its funnier than the original. There's more megan fox provocativity. Hell you even see bee get down in this one. Whoever says there was no plot obviously can't pay attention, but there is a ton of action, ill give it that. I think the origins of their race kept up fine with the action. Best movie since Iron Man.",1
316," This movie is the embodiment of what makes me sad for our entire society. I'm sure that it will make money and I'm sure that so many people will walk out loving it. If you love characters as shallow as tea spoons, a plot that seems like looking at each individual piece of a jigsaw puzzle, and think that big explosions and lots of running around makes a great movie, then you will love Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Sadly, it seems that more and more audience members fall into this catagory. Where's the intelligence? Where's the actual storytelling? Where's the humanity? Pathetic, pathetic attempt from the most pathetic director of our time.",0
319,absolutely junk!!! man i liked the first one and it was the first bay's movie that i actually liked but that one was too loud too long and sux!!!. If i was the editor i think the movie was about 1 hour... Too much unnecessary shots and talks that makes most of the movie to a garbage time!!!,0
320," I have never given a zero star rating to a film before. Ever. And I certainly wasn't expecting great art here-you hear the word 'Transformers' associated with a film and you have an idea of what to expect. But dear God almighty...where to begin? Loud? Check. Long? Check. Offensive morally, sexually, and racially? Check, check, and check. Now, to be fair, I will acknowledge that this is exactly what we thought it would be. After all, this is Michael Bay we're talking about. But just because it was expected doesn't make it good. The first Transformers had it's fair share of haters (for good reason), but ultimately those flaws and offensive innuendos were (in my opinion) massaged over by the humor and for the most part thrilling visuals. Here...it's just more. More, more, more, albeit less, less, less. More action? Less character development. More visuals? Less heart. More raunch? Less clever. I don't mind a movie being two and a half hours long, filthy as heck, and altogther stupid- that's what 'Knocked Up' is for. But a movie also has to have a heart, a brain, and a soul. 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' doesn't even have the audacity to pretend-it just explodes, and explodes, and explodes, over and over and over and over again. Yes, we were expecting it...but honestly, now that it's out, how many have really, truly enjoyed it?",0
321," I can't stand movie critics anymore. Pretentious people trying to find fault in everything with nothing better to do than pan whatever they can and following the trends like sheep. Not every movie has to TRY to be an epic drama, there is something called ""Let's just have fun at the movies"" that I think the critics of the world have totally lost the concept of. Michael bay practically invented the popcorn flick Genre, and this is one of his best examples. This was the best popcorn flick I have seen in a long time. Was it ""Schindler's List"" or ""Gladiator"" from a plot standpoint? NO.. Do I EXPECT or WANT that? No... It was more campy than the first, better fight choreography, better action sequences, more character development, had a more robo-centric plot, introduced some very cool characters and in general was FUN TO WATCH. I was not bored at all, and the story did make sense to me (but maybe it's because I remember the original show, who knows). This movie deserves to be in the 70s not the 30s, it was EXACTLY what I wanted from a Michael Bay movie, it was EXACTLY what I expected, which is a fun, brainless, popcorn flick that didn't try to take itself too seriously. Cool action, Cool Cars, Funny Characters, good comic relief moments, and I didn't find the ""Racial stereotypes"" that at all, they were a funny nod to american pop-culture (why is it OK for Chris Tucker to act this way in a movie like Friday, but not OK for a robot to do it in Transformers? It's not like Mudflap and Skids weren't total bad-asses taking on Devestator, they were comic relief and good in action and if it had been Chris Tucker doing voice talent no one would have cared one bit. Stop being so sensitive about every joke.. the president is black, get over yourselves).",1
322, Another case of Michael Bay using SFX instead of a plot. But at least you get to look at Megan Fox.,0
323," Clearly mistitled, this movie is a mess. OK, everything bigger, badder, more explosive",0
324," I am absolutely shocked and disgusted by these critics, except for TV Guide which hit it right on the spot, a 100. Transformers 2 Is one of the greatest movies ever made, Id had everything a movie needed, the CGI was absolutely insane, in a good way. This movie's gonna make a fortune, already made 60.6 Million on its opening day and not on a weekend, but made that on a Wednesday! The Record for most made on a Wednesday. I think you critics don't know anything about reviewing movies and all I can say is all of you people should get fired. While you guys waste your time and thinking of clever ways to dis Michael Bay's, he's going to be laughing at all of em all the way to the bank.",1
325," So I saw this last night and I gotta say that I really liked it. When I saw the first one a few years ago, I left the theatre amazed and nostalgic and thinking all the cars around me were going to suddenly transform! When I left the theatre last night I felt the same way. Sure it was a long movie and some parts were cheesy, but overall it is certainly an awesome movie and no one should shun seeing this movie because of the critics. I really don't see how these people watched the same movie I did.",1
326," I liked the first film - I thought given the premise it was a remarkable achievement. This movie removes just about everything plausible and dramatic, and doubles or triples everything that was implausible to begin with. It is inconsistent, implausible, noisy and insulting - and this is especially annoying because within the world it created, the first one was not.",0
327," First, this movie is long, too long by 45 minutes. It's boring. If it had been shorter, then I might have actually enjoyed it a smidgeon. If you have young kids who want to see this movie, you should no there is racism and animal sex in it. It's not suitable for them. It is also long--so much so that they even got bored before the big explosions at the end. Also, my oldest was not even that happy with the movie because they focused to much on the humans and not enough on the robots.",0
329," Much better then the first, which was just pointless camera angles, and you couldn't even see what was happening. This one at least had good enjoyable action scenes, and that's about all you can expect from a movie like this.. sure the story was a tad bit flat, but the first wasn't any better.. so whatever.",1
330," The first transformers was somewhat clever, but this one was so infantile that it verged on insulting to anyone over the age of eleven.",0
331," I had already heard bad things about the movie before I went to go see it. My biggest problem with the first movie was that it wasnt really""Transformers"" the movie, It was ""Shia LaBeouf : Featuring the Transformers"". There were more chances to let the actual Transformers shine in this one but I honestly could barely get myself to care about the human characters. Why was the comedy so terribly childish this time also? Bay Needs to stop filming Fox's assets and focus on making us stop hating the human characters.",0
332," Loved the first movie. Can't stand this one. All of the reviewers are correct, this movie is a steaming pile. Here are the major problems with this movie: no explanation of where or when all these new robots showed up, lots of un-needed cursing by the Autobots, Sam's mom running around like an idiot, a double dose of Jar-Jar Binks like Autobots called the Twins, a No Country for Old Men style ending in which the movie just suddenly ends out of the blue, the villain that they spent the whole movie building up as a really bad dude getting killed in less than 15 seconds, and last but not least robot testicles. The movie is 2.5 hrs long, but they could've shaved 30+ minutes off if they didn't have un-needed stuff like Sams mom eating weed infused brownies and running across the college campus while Sam and his dad chase her. Completely pointless and brought nothing to the story. I wasted $21 to see this movie, I hope you do not do the same. I will not even be renting this movie at the Redbox for $1 when it comes out on DVD.",0
333," The critic reviews are dumb. If you liked the first Transformers at all, you will love the second. I thought it was a great summer movie.",1
334," Transformer trash! Don't waste your time or money. The ""frat boy"" humor and crude sexual content over shadow the slightest twinge of a plot. Transterrible! -0",0
335," Boo to anyone who gave this movie a rating below 6. If you're a transformers fan like myself, then this movie hit all the nostalgic moments from whence it was still done in cartoon form. There is finally a good autobots vs decepticons battle, one that is worthy of the comics and cartoon. I will only cut the perfect score by a bit, because of the over focused human element and fallen was kinda lame and very underplayed and integral bad ass part of the transformers universe.",1
336," Again, a score of 10 to balance out the ridiculous 0 score reviews. Did people walk into this expecting Chekhov or Shakespeare for crying out loud? This is mindless blockbuster fun at its best. If you think mindless fun is in itself a bad thing, and that a person's entertainment must consist of earnest, worthy pursuits and improve their soul and raise the spirit of mankind, in short, if you take yourself and life too seriously, then you probably will be breast-clutchingly anguished whilst watching this film. For those who like to occasionally switch off their brains and have a laugh at a big, silly, spectacular robot based bit of nonsense, this fits the bill perfectly. For those who want something more cerebral, spend your time and money elsewhere instead of using the film as ammunition for trite comments on cultural decline and boring everyone else with your views. This is not art, this is entertainment.",1
337," Is it oscar worthy? No, it's not trying to be. Is it a much better, more polished version of what made the original a huge hit? Yes. Everything here is bigger, more ambitous, and more fun. The storyline is much more interesting, the fighting is alot better, and the overall structure and pace of the film works alot better this time around. The actors did a great job, Shia is very talented and Megan, despite what people say about her, actually is quite a decent actress. Give it a chance, when you go into this movie, just expecting a very solid summer blockbuster with a franchise of your youth, you'll love it. Go into it expecting an oscar film, then you'll end up like all the bitter movie snob reviewers.",1
338," Critics have no clue what they are talking about. these guys are paid by other studios to bury it. critics should not exist. and should not be allowed to view their personal opinion until at least a month after the movie has been out. movie was awesome, great story(to the one who claims it was awful, you have not idea what is good or not.) very action packed.",1
339," The movie is excellent! I don't know what the critic is expecting to give a punctuation, they can not expect this movie to be like ""high score"" movies where important characters die or something weird happen to make the critic happier. The newspaper critic is nothing, We as a customers paying all together million dollars to enjoy the movie and make it possible, we have the last word, our score is the most valuable. 10 for the transformers 10 and a half!!",1
340," It would appear that the media is taking this opportunity to attack Michael Bay after finally realising that he is not, in fact, a good director. However it would appear that they are doing so for the wrong reasons. Yes, Transformers did have a number of cons that were apparent to the viewer over the pros of the film. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen however does not. Upon viewing this film it is apparent that Michael Bay's directing skills have improved since 2007 and this becomes very clear during the fight-scenes although there are moments where he goes back to his sloppy Paul Greengrass-inspired style of filming during action scenes. Then of course there seems to be an over-use of rotating around the set during scenes of intense, important or romantic dialogue. Nevertheless the film is simply pure fun as it is intended to be and so it would seem that the majority of critics have gone in to see Transformers -another film inspired by what was supposed to be a children's cartoon... Let me say that again: A Children's Cartoon- thinking that it should be the Be All and End All of fantastical movie adaptations. While at times Michael Bay does annoy the audience with some of his redundant filming techniques, as well as editing, the cast -both on the set and voice acting- never stop giving their all for one second... With the exception of one cheesy moment between an unconcious Shia LeBeouf and an upset Megan Fox. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a movie pertaining to action, comedy and is an epic escapade that that is most of all: Pure Fun. One might even say that this is a redemption for Michael Bay and some of the previous disasters he has had the dreaded pleasure of introducing to the world (can you say Armageddon and Pearl Harbor?) but that may be going a bit too far. Either way we shall see with Transformers 3 and whatever projects this -what appears to be- developing Michael Bay brings to us.",1
341," I am so shocked that this movie got low ratings. I am pretty deep into sci-fi Films and this movie is more well thought out than people realize. I wanted Terminator Salvations to be great, but I can't say that it was, but Transformers was very well thought out and goes into the origins of the Transformers. Some of the stuff could have been left out, but as a whole it was much better than the first. Felt like I was watching the 80s cartoon. Plus trying to interpret much of the film leaves one to really think and even apply some biblical scriptures. Perhaps it's not for the weak of mind after all.",1
342," Racist and juvenile jokes aside, this movie was just bad. Explosions can't take place of good or even competent writing.",0
343, Great movie! An improvement over the first one.Great movie! An improvement over the first one.,1
344, People are just giving it low ratings because they obviously do not know what Transformers is. Who cares about human touch? The people who are complaining about the who talk about human touch are so wrong. Its about the Transformers mainly and the action. It felt more like the cartoon. Which is a good thing. I was in awe with the users giving it bad ratings. Either they have way to high expectations or they dont know crap about transformers. The critics I could care less about since they dont know how to rate movies and like one of the users below said they rate good movies bad and bad movies good. I hate critics. Anyways if you love transformers you will like this movie especially if you like lots of action. Also I am a big fan of Starscream and for all you Starscream fans hes got lines in this one! He actually talks in this one instead of saying like one thing and plays a bigger part. Anyways go see the movie and enjoy it.,1
345, The action is all that matters in a science fiction movie.,1
346," Awseome action, lots of fun, and a scary amount of truth is how the goverment decided to try to blame the Autobots for everything. I'ma a woman, and I have yet to see how it was supposed to be offensive or demeaning. And I absolutely love Jetfire!!",1
347," Mr. Bay must wake up each morning laughing that he makes millions off of serving up piles of crap to movie fans. In this sequel we literally have the fine actor John Tuturro ask arobit with a cane (no joke) this question: ""What is the plot? You know the beginning, middle and end. Tell us the story."" Oh I get it, the jokes on us! This film is pointless, discontinuous, and completely nonsensical.",0
348, The movie was awesome if you grew up in the 80's.you all say it was't funny you must have been the one old ugly dude in the corner not laughing because everybody ealse was.The twins were fun i didn' care for the three bikes or devastator but the rest was great.,1
349," Humor, Robots, Explosions, Megan Fox The perfect summer movie.",1
350," People are going to complain about any summer blockbuster that Michael bay directs. This movie is pure win and nothing but awesome at every turn. There are even a few moments I won't mention that had my wife and I AT TEARS. How they can elicit so much emotion and human actions from robots just echoes the brilliance of this and the first movie. This is going to be the biggest grossing movie ever - bigger than the dark knight and Titanic at the box office. This movie had it all - humor, cutting edge visual effects, heartfelt moments, lovable characters, excellent score, great pacing, great cinematography, wonderful acting and anything else you can think of this movie had it in spades. I say damn the haters who will hate just because it's Michael Bay. Go watch it for yourself and if you have an open mind and are there to enjoy yourself then you will have a great time. It's kind of hip to be the big non-conformist and go against anything mainstream. Don't sell this movie short because of the critics who are all in their high horses judging what everyone else should enjoy. The only reason it doesn't get a 10 from me is because it was about 20 minutes too long.",1
351," After seeing this movie, it is clearly the best movie i have ever seen. I saw it in IMAX which probably helped. And let me start by saying you have to watch this movie in the theatre or with surround sound otherwise it isnt going to be nearly as good. This movie had incredible action sequences that sometimes had my chair rumbling. There are gorgeous chicks and i thought it had a decent storyline. The best improvement from the first one would definitely be the jokes and funny parts. I guess all the haters don't have a good sense of humor....AT ALL. Maybe everyone that rated this movie poorly should have gone to see the Proposal haha. Or rented Driving Miss Daisy. There might be movies that excel better in certain qualities than transformers 2, but it easily has the best combined action, humor, love-sex appeal story out there. Surely a movie that broke a box office record is better than a 36/100 rating critics?",1
352," (***SELF-POLICING SPOILER ALERT***) ""I don't get it,"" objects Josh Baskin(Tom Hanks) after his colleague's presentation of a new toy line(skyscrapers that transform into robots) fails to excite his twelve-year-old self in Penny Marshall's ""Big"". Cars that transform into robots are easier to get, but my inner twelve-year-old self(recently excited by J.J. Abrams' ""Star Trek"") was equally unimpressed. ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" plays like a response to Trey Parker and Matt Stone's ""Team America: World Police"", which expertly lampooned the bombast of major studio action movies, including this filmmaker's entire ouevre. French landmarks are leveled by the marionette puppets, impervious of its historical significance, whereas the Egyptian pyramids in ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"", seem inevitable for destruction, and is, when one of the Decepticons and Optimus Prime go roboto-a-roboto upon its ancient angled surface, without any awareness that their fighting venue is one of the world's seven wonders. This ""America, f*** yeah"" attitude had reared its ugly head in ""Bad Boys 2"" too, in which a car chase leads to the plowing of third world tenement homes as if nobody occupied these humble abodes. They're unseen. Interestingly enough, the filmmaker stages a likeminded chase through the Shanghai ghetto, but this time, he has the decency to show an old man seated at his table while the mayhem goes on behind him. That's what passes for a sensitive side with the guy who's made only one passable film to date(""The Island""). Most offensive of all is the mind-numbing action that takes place in Egypt, as the war between the Decepticons and Autobots seemingly goes on forever, as if we cared about its outcome.",0
353," Just because it's a ""SUMMER"" movie is NOT an excuse for the mess this movie was. There have been plenty of ""SUMMER"" fare such as the Bourne films, IronMan, and Star Trek, that proves that plot, substance, and characterization are possible for ""SUMMER"" blockbusters. it speaks of the mental capacity of people who actually defend this to the end with that ridiculous argument.",0
354," Given that probably 80% of the people that went to see this movie were expecting the not so great movies of Bay, and seeing Fox in skimpy outfits and just all out robot warfare, not at all close to the cartoon, then yes, it accoplished all these things and a little more....cheesy love story, then again, don't we all have that at one point....in our lives?....Great movie to escape from reality no doubt.",1
355," This is a great summer blockbuster. If anyone, critics or fans alike, went into this movie expecting a deep, oscar-worthy story or character development, they should be legally banned from seeing any movie ever again for their stupidity. Transformers is not and never was meant to be a deeply emotional, moving story. It is meant to be a fun, action-packed escape from reality, and it fulfills this role perfectly. People need to stop giving it bad reviews just because they don't like Micheal Bay or they wanted some kind sophisticated, high art movie in Transformers 2. Sure, Bay may never win an Oscar for best director, but he makes amazing action movies and should be commended for doing a great job with this movie. People should stop looking for some kind of moral lesson or emotionally moving experience with movies by Bay or any other summer blockbuster for that matter, because they won't find it and will come away dissapointed. Try having fun at the theater for once and you will surely learn to enjoy and love movies like this. The critics should jump off their high horse and realize that having fun is just as important in making a great movie as a great story or lots of character development. 10 out of 10, will be waiting in line to get it on DVD.",1
356, This movie is incredibly underrated. Wow. If you like action movies...see this movie. It doesn't not disappoint...at all,1
357," I loved the first movie (saw it 7 times in theaters, countless more on DVD), and I loved this one, too. All the people marking it down, did you expect something more than a long, loud, thoughtless experience?",1
359," Let me explain to all the uninitiated who likes this movie - boys between the ages of 15 and 25 or so. If you are older than 30 and you really enjoy this film, your life has been a failure and you watched way too few films. Non-stop clattering and clanging, action sequences that are just pure spectacle, a stupid plotline. These movies are meant to sell products people! I have yet to talk to any discerning moviegoer over 30 years old who has any desire to see this. It's for little boys! Time to put the toys away kids...and start watching some better films. The 1 rating goes for Megan Fox.",0
360," Its a fun summer flick. All the scores below 50 are written by pompous morons with there head up their own asses. If i recorded a toy on the floor with no dialogue, these same ""critics"" would applaud it and score it through the roof. They like to prove their ""intellectuality"" by tearing down fun movies. Last time i checked, usually people go to theaters to have fun and thats exactly Transformers does. Please for the love of god, dont base your movie choices on what critics have to say. Base it purely on word of mouth.",1
361," If you make a movie about transformer's, then you should be able to tell starscream from Megatron. You know your movie has issues. I also counted up to 12-15 comic relief character's In this movie thats just ridiculous. By the time this was finished, I began wishing for the two and a half hours of my life back.",0
362," I loved this movie. The characters and the plot was weak. I came to this movie to see Autobots and Decepticons beat each other up. I came for the visual effects. I also found this movie quite funny, more so than the first. I didn't come to this movie because I thought it would have an amazing plot and great acting. That being said I did not think either were that bad, not good, but not bad either. I loved this movie, I thought it was exciting and not anywhere close to boring. Liked it more than the first. Everything I liked in the first was better and there was a lot more of it in this one. To me this movie-More is better!",1
363," This film is amazing! It's exactly what I wanted to see - a perfect summer film. If I had seen this when I was a kid, I probably would've passed out from sheer enjoyment. As it is, I left with a ton of positive energy and inspiration. That's exactly what art should do. Visuals, score, acting, storytelling, directing - all superb. I'm going to see this again tomorrow!",1
364," Micheal Bay does it again. And it's even worse than Transformers 1. If you have a brain and like to use it, stay away from this movie.",0
365," Horrible. The script was surprisingly bad for a summer popcorn action flick. The stupid dialogue and terrible acting get in the way of what we really came to see: kick-ass special effects and Megan Fox! I mean, if you're not even going to try to make a decent plot, why not just shoot an hour of robot battles and slow-mo boob shots? Instead, we get 2 1/2 hours of misery. Unless you're still in middle school, save your money for something (anything!) else. I liked the first one. I hated this movie.",0
366," Really, does anyone who has seen this movie believe that persons ranking it a ""10"" (or above a 4) are anything but robots paid by the studio? It is impossible for human beings to watch this movie and interpret it as good--based upon any standard--without being paid or programmed.",0
368," All I'm gonna say is, if you really loved Transformers in the 80's then you'll love this. It is the closest thing to the old movie then the first live action film. Watch an old G1 episode the might look different but you know that if it was made now thats how it would be, hell I watch the G1 episodes some times and think Iron Hide is gonna drop an F-bomb or two. I know most of us would in the situatoins they get into. So all in all Ignore the crys and sobbs of all the low scores, see it if only once in the cinema because it won't be the same if you only see it on DVD or Blu-Ray. Can't wait for the next installment.",1
369," Great film! Action, adventure, humor, hot women-this movie has it all. Awesome climax and likable characters. Great movie.",1
370," I think what some of these critics fail to see is that this movie wasn't meant to try and win awards it was made to be an action packed and entertaining movie for those who want to see giant explosions and robots fight each other. If they wanted to try and get good reviews from some of these up-tight critics they would have had random setups like conflicting racial stories, or gay robots fighting for their rights, or a young robot gets pregnant or something dumb. It is funny how the critic that gave this no stars gave a movie like Land of the Lost 2-3 stars and said ""You just have to lower your expectations a bit"".",1
371, Totally awesome movie and I hope they do several more. The critics are mostly out of touch with what's good or bad and I've learned that if a lot of them say the movie is bad you can rest assured that it's one kick butt movie.,1
372," I really dont know what people expect from a transformers film. It does exactly wats said on the tin. Really great actrion, better fights than the first film, funny and really enjoyable to watch. It does not feel like a 2 1/2 hour film because it engages you so much. I thought it was a class summer film and just the film i thought it would be. To the people that think it is ot how the comics were you the ones saying its not good because theres not enough depth please get over it and remember there robots that are their to fight and thats what they do exceptionally.",1
373," I laughed. I almost cried. I most certainly had a great time watching this movie. Anyone who walks into a summer block buster action flick expecting Oscar performances needs to keep their money and go watch something else. On the other hand if you want to watch some incredible robot fight sequences, an intense paced, explosions every where, humor ridden, action adventure because you believe movies are supposed to be fun to watch then you NEED to see Transformers II. This all ready has a coveted spot in my Blue Ray collection to go with the first movie. 2.5 hours of life well spent!",1
374," Notice how the low scores are all by stuck up journalists who obviously don't like good action films. They probably get off watching documentaries or something. Good film, ignore the critics.",1
375, A disposable piece of crap.,0
376," Everything I liked about this movie... the explosions, the action, the appearances of more autobots and decepticons... and Megan Fox. I had an erection throughout the whole movie. Micheal Bay did an excellent job.",1
377," Honestly, I can't understand how people are giving this movie anything but a ZERO! So many people bash critics for saying what should be said about completely piece of garbage movies like this. Seriously, everyone wake up and remember that films can actually have a plot that seems plausible (even if it is a fantasy film) or a script that's not completely leveled to the lowest common denominator. Please, everyone, pull your fucking heads out of your fucking asses! Thank you.",0
378, Very thrilling!,1
380,"I have to laugh at all  these 10's being awarded to this garbage. And to those of you bashing the film critics for giving low numbers, maybe they go to see films like I do to see good acting, an interesting story and something that doesn't insult your intelligence, AND yes be entertained. If i am looking for a thrill, I'll go ride a roller coaster or go skiing. I'm just glad I live in a large city where I actually have other options unlike in small towns where you are prtty much force into watching this.",0
381," Y'know... I understand that a lot of 400 pound basement dwellers think this film is ""full of win"" and ""pure awesomeness"" considering that their lives is limited to collecting dolls that look like robots. But fact is, seeing Transformers 2 made me realize that Michael Bay is our American version of Uwe Boll. He's a man that firmly believes that fanboys and 12 year olds will eat this crap up if he hides all the manure behind non-stop explosions, slo-mo cleavage shots and cheestastic lines. Aside from selling toys, this film will probably sell a ton of advil since all the loud noise and shaky-cam are sure to give everyone a headache. Peter Travers is wrong though. This movie is the worse film not just of this decade, but the worse film in decades. Period. You can place Transformers 2 right next to Battlefield Earth, Gigli and Istar. Worse film of the year so far.",0
382," Yes it's a little long but for fans of Transformers, it's a great sequel.",1
383, Not at all as good as the first and a $ waste. I do not see what these ppl are saying about it as being good and no one really explains why it is good. Good summer movie? that lowers your standards quickly by saying that.,0
385, Flimsy non-existant plot carried by bland one-dimensional characters supporting ridiculously ulta-masculine techno-fetishistim. GIANT ROBOTS BASHING EXPLOSIONS MEGAN FOX RUNNING IN SLOW MOTION THE END. This movie is AWESOME. Came away feeling so dirty.... and liking it. It was exhaustively long but I can't wait to see it again.,1
387," I am not an ""overpaid film critic"". In fact, I am a nineteen year old who has more then half a brain which may be the reason why I found this movie absolutely atrocious. There was no plot, terrible dialogue, dizzy special effects, borderline racist robots, and all of this in two and a half hours. It was crude, disgusting, and all around terrible. It made me clinically depressed.",0
388, Let me put it this way: hard working adults understand the formula of TIME = MONEY. This movie? Biggest waste of time ever; especially considering you have to pay money to see it. If you'e 16 and mom gave you $20 for the weekend so you could get milkshakes and a movie: go for it. It's probably right up you're alley. People with better things to do should know better.,0
389, More boring than than 150 minutes of watching paint dry. Avoid this like the plague.,0
390," I have to admit that when the movie started I was a little concern of no relationship to the first. Well, I was wrong. The story is very clear, the graphics are great, Megan, range of robots, action for most of the movie. Wow. Even the theatre I was at was nearly full of all ages. I am really hoping for a T3. Lets see some Dinobots or maybe an introduction to triple changers. Even better yet- lets see Primes Trailer. Thanks Bay for a GREAT MOVIE.",1
391, The critics if anything should just get there garbage to themselves or better yet tell it to someone who actually pays attention to them like their family. honestly this is a great movie full of action and great computer affects i would watch this movie again and all my fiends have said the same. critics who hired them and whoever did should be fired along with them remember a movie is suppose to entertain you not bored and if you sit down and actually break down the movie instead of watching it then really get a life because that means you need to check in your brain in the door because your cant enjoy a movie and most likely you wont enjoy life. transformer 2 thumbs uo way up the critics a*s's lol.,1
392, This movie was great it had action comedy and even a little touching moment at the end. It never slowed down kept ur attention from start to finish.,1
394," Apparently, these film critics haven't the movie yet..... This movie was awesome.. Even better than the first, which was also a great movie.",1
395," I couldn't wait to see this movie. What a letdown! I am not one to walk out on movies, but I nearly did several times on this one. They could have done so much better than sex jokes, come on, what did the dog ""dominating"" the other one have to do with the movie? It's Transformers for crying out loud, giant robots, and this is the best the script team could do? I will say in it's favor, hence the two stars, that they do the visual effects very well. At the end of the movie though, I felt like the character on the pyramid, ""under the scrotum"" of the shmucks that wrote the script. Very disappointing!",0
396," This gets a 3 rating for the CGI, which - admittedly, was quite amazing. Other than that, this film fails on many different levels. For starters - this is a film based on a kids toys and cartoons. The amount of foul language and sexual and drug references were intolerable for that basis. I really liked the first TF film and thought it was a nice throwback for the youthful days of playing with the toys, but this film is just too much. Bay was quoted as saying he was gonna make this film ""epic"". Well, to me, ""Epic"" does not mean throwing almost 50 different robots into the story, but only giving a backstory on a half dozen of them. Most of the bots are relegated to one or two scenes, and it's near impossible to tell who's who 90% of the time. The end battle was a write off since almost every Decepticon looked identical! Storywise this film was awful, and it doesn't help that the human actors, aside from Turturro can't act!! I don't know what Spielberg sees in Shia - he's an average actor who's just gotten some really lucky breaks IMO. Megan Fox, while being great to look at, has the actiing talent of a kleenex. One of my biggest gripes with the film were Skids and Mudflap, the twin Autobots. By God, I have never seen anything so blatantly racist since JJ Binks in TPM!! Gold Teeth, dreads, and talking in that pseudo-ghetto dialogue - it makes me wonder how they were given the go-ahead to be in the film!? The movie was WAY too long, as many reviews have pointed out, and the decibel level was enough to shatter eardrums! Very disappointed in what could have been a good follow-up to a solid beginning.",0
397," Action was brilliant - But the Jar-Jar Binks -Gansta robots were horrible!!! Obviously this was a big Hollywood / Retail chain store ie. Wal*mart / Hasbro -money grab... but seriously why did the director have to dumb it down? Was the directive to make it funny to the Wal*mart crowd? So much of the movie could be cut out. It reminds me of the Star Wars prequels... another Hasbro offering... Poor excuse to get butts in theaters seats in order to collect money and have the mindless herd pick up cheap, made in China, plastic toys at Wal*Mart... They could have at least let the audience live an intelligent fantasy... Instead it was dumb-ed down into garbage.",0
398," Amazing movie, my friends and I agree it is better than the first. I have an incredible mentality of the 'sequels suck' rule, but this is a good exception. My only regret is seeing it before my girlfriend, but then again, that's a great excuse to see it again! I loved the show, now I love the movies, I can't believe critics hated it so much.",1
399," Terrible writing in the grade of Optimus' line: ""Give me your face!"", one of the worst plots I have seen, filled with so much useless and stupid 'developments'. Cheap attempts at comedy that degraded the characters, robotic and otherwise, and occasional scenes of cool robots fighting. Don't spend the money. If you keep paying for it, Bay will keep making this drivel.",0
400, Transformers is the best movie i have ever seen in my life up until now. you have never seen such a jaw-dropping mind fascinating aw-inspiring movie ever. it totally surpased everything i was hoping it would be and is well worth my money.,1
401," This movie was terrible. Worst part being the twins, which are obviously racial stereotypes. Not only is it borderline offensive, but it gets really old after the first few gags. Secondly the movie introduces way too many new characters (that are annoying and/or underdeveloped), concepts (that some how lacked importance to be even mentioned in the first movie), and poor execution of raunchy humor. For example: An completely new arch villain is created only to kill him and keep the original two villains alive for the next sequel. The movie played like a bad comedy with robot action on the side. Save your money and wait until it hits the Redbox. That way you can fast forward to the action and Megan Fox. And the hot Decepticon chick.",0
402," Before I start I'll make it clear that I am not an overpaid film critic, or even an underpaid film critic, I'm a solid lover of great movies and solid gold rubbish fits within what I enjoy. But there's great rubbish and rubbish rubbish and this has got to be the worst film I think I have ever seen in my life. And it isn't because it is all explosions and it's loud and it's aimed at the popcorn munching Saturday afternoon crowd because there's nothing wrong with that, it's because it is pretentious and stupid and borderline racist (it damn well is, no point arguing otherwise) and doesn't even TRY and put a spine of a storyline in there. Even the worst Steven Seagal movie has a spine of a story in it. It may be a bad story full of holes but it is there, trying to tie it all together and give a point to the money being spent. This film doesn't even try, and my final opinion is that this film and everyone who made it not only wasted my time and money but abused my good nature as an easy going action flick lover. In fact I'd ask Metacritic to instigate a minus rating for this, because zero just ain't bad enough, I feel like I need a way to express what this film took from me, beyond the 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back. And to anyone who found the metal 'balls' joke funny - even my kids thought that was stupid.",0
403," Wow, how many of you guys work for Paramount? Probably all of you that said ""awesome movie"" and ""best film ever"". No matter what you think, you can't possibly think its the best movie ever without sounding like you're being paid to promote it. Terrible marketing ploy and pretty shameless, but it's $200m terrible movie, so can't argue. Also, Megan Fox is not all that.",0
404," OK I'm assuming that most of the people on here who gave this a nine or ten either are under the age of 15 or actually work the movie studio...if that isn't the case I'm not sure if you're even reviewing the same movie I saw...and the only reason I'm even giving this a one is because of the special effects and the actors. I'm a big Transformers fan, but not a big Michael Bay fan. I actually like all the main characters in the film ""robot and otherwise"" ...well... except for that roommate kid and maybe that ignorant politician guy and the two twin robots and since I",0
405, All I wanted from this movie. Good action. A lot of Cheese. Fun. I guess it will win some MTV awards.,1
406, I felt if you have seen the first one than this is a great movie but i can see how some people could get lost. It had every thing i expected and enjoyed from the first one and it is definitey worth the money I would say it worth watching twice.,1
407, I really can't say much for the movie. This movie was a cataclysmic bore. I agree with everything Rolling Stone had to say about it. The hype was ridiculous and the movie is overrated (even for the 31 Critic Score).,0
408," Forget the critics....this one's a pure audience pleaser. Most everyone I saw enjoyed this film's action and cg...and the story wasn't horrible. These ""pro"" reviewers just love jumping on the negative bandwagon. What did they expect for a movie about Transforming space robots?",1
409," If you're not a Megan Fox fanboy or a Michael Bay worshipper, steer clear from this with a 10 foot pole. Too much toiler humour that isn't funny, poorly edited battle scenes (except the Optimus 1v3 forest fight), annoying character, 2 Jar Jar Binks in Skids and Mudflap. I'm a Transformers fan, and try as I can to like this film, I simply can't.",0
410," While the first Transformers wasn't really a good movie, it was fine for a summer blockbuster -- giant robot fights and explosions; enough action to keep me entertained without getting bogged down in trying to tell a serious plot which probably would have sucked. This is exactly why Transformers 2 is HORRENDOUS. Instead of just having a lot of cool action scenes, they try to tell a convoluted plot which really doesn't even make sense, and has gigantic holes left and right. Almost everything about this film was terrible, other than the fight in the trees with Optimus Prime.",0
411," I think it was better than the first. I did think the small bots were stereotypical however. Optimus was a bad ass. ""I'll take you all on!""",1
412," I went in for the action, sound, visuals and what I got was outstanding in that department. Story and diolgue were pretty crap, but it could have been worse, as bad as Terminator Salvation Like staring at a blank piece of emotionless paper.",1
413," Oh my dear God. I am sick and tired of critics BS. Yes so it was a little long but that movie had it all: special effects, romance, drama.... and a lot of funny moments. I mean come on. Not all movies can be the same. Some movies need to just entertain, bring us back memories of when we were kids. But I guess critics and journalists have pretty sad childhoods. Anyway, this movie gets a 10 from me, not because it deserves a good mark, but because it doesn't deserve the low marks it got from those bitc... I mean critics.",1
414, A terrible embarassment of a movie.,0
415, I liked this movie as I did the original. I do not believe that this was quite as good as the first but none the less very enjoyable to see. The special effects action scenes did cause burning sensation to my eyes though. (Wow!!),1
416," I'm 59 years old and no Hasbro Transformer fan. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Each time it ""lagged' with quote/unquote human Bay came through with more robot interaction. This is a move about giant robots battling one another. I had no problem distinguishing main character robots from one another. And I love that the heft of the robots was conveyed. The critics are being over-critical of what is intended to be a popcorn movie. It delivers. Could I have done without Skids and Mudflap being minstrel characters or the humping on Fox's leg, sure. Dit it ruin the movie, absolutely not. The Fallen is a winner.",1
417," Let me start off by stating that I'm a fan of Michael Bay's work. But this movie is terrible. Everything about it is terrible. Including the action scenes. Not sure how Bay screws up an action scene, since he wrote the book on How To Film an Action Scene In a Modern Action Movie. But he does, he bumbles through the plot to get us to these action set pieces that are either so brief that any and all built up momentum is crushed, or the action scene itself is filmed as a rushed and blurred mess. Besides the millions of issues with story and continuity or whether or not a third of the characters needed to even be in the film, the whole thing's a huge mess that left me severely disappointed. The only other time I've disliked a Bay film was ""Pearl Harbor,"" and only because I thought the direction the love-triangle story went in made you hate the characters, and in a movie like that hating all of the main characters just didn't make any sense. But at least with ""Pearl Harbor"" Bay got the action right. I know a lot of people seem to like this. But honestly, I think it's just a fad. In a year or so, most of these people will have either latched onto the next big thing and forgotten this completely (people like this turned-coat real quick on last year's ""Dark Knight"") or will have come to their sense enough after multiple viewings when the adrenaline wears itself thin and they'll realize that there isn't really much at all to this movie to make it last.",0
418,the movie was great acting was bad for what was asked for and for all of you who think that it's not apropriate for little children well the movie is directed to the addience that watched it as a kid a good amount of years back and now those people are grown up and why not make this movie directed to the older crowd whould you rather watch that movie with a pg or g rating and for the twin robots they weren't that stupid they were actually pretty funny,1
419," Same cheeseball humor that made the first movie fun. Faster-paced action, with a plot that is just as intelligible as the original Transformers. A little long for some. Young children may cry, and it may make you deaf. All in stunning CGI.",1
420," Big waste of time. Wayy too long with a story definitely not strong enough to support the length. Some of the action scenes are cool, but it gets really boring after a while. The acting is pretty bland also. If you really wanna watch this just wait for DVD.",0
422, Both Steve Buscemi and the Wayans brothers should sue for royalties.,0
424," If you take this film too seriously then you suck the fun out of it. People seem to forget that its a film based on a line of kids toys! If you want a film with an intricate storyline then watch the DaVinci code, don't watch a film about giant alien robots beating seven shades of shrapnel out of each other and complain about the narrative.",1
425," You know bay has gone crazy,somebody stop this guy..I want my precious hours back that I have wasted on this,ok the CGI has improved but not Michael bay's brain.",0
426," This movie was a total mental torcher,wonder where his brain was during the whole movie....But it has a shot at worst movie of the year...At least he will win something for this crap.",0
427," It is the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life,shame on michael bay for his lengthy and poorly executed film.",0
428," Horrible! I'm sorry that I contributed to its success, because this just encourages him to do it again. What kind of directing was this, the acting was among the worst I've seen. And the camera work was so awful; you couldn't clearly see the transformations. Very disappointing because I really like action movies.",0
429," How can you hate this movie? I mean the plot was great, i really liked how they were in egypt and the fight scenes are awesome. The cast was awesome Shila Lebeouf and Megan Fox put on a show. There were alot of actor's that got boost up in their career just for being in this movie. The character's are preety awesome especially the robots and the actual people. So overall this is a awesome movie and you will get your $ worth.",1
430, Way too many things in the movie that didnt need to be there. Very disappointing even with low expectations.,0
431," I loved the first film, and this built on how great the first film was. Personally, I thought the comedy was better written then it gets credit for, the acting is passable enough, but the plot was very poor in my opinion. But who cares?! The action was incredible! This film was a lot of fun! It was a bit too long and some of the boring scenes could've been cut down, but it was a fun fun film in the end. Everybody can enjoy this film if they don't take it seriously. It isn't perfect, but it is terribly underrated in my opinion of course.",1
432," This film, is terrible. Bad plot, bad continuity and most of all, the music feels like it's on infinite loop. Hearing that Greenday song play through once is enough, thank you. I can't think of a single thing I liked about this film.",0
433, This movie was awesome. Anyone who doesn't like it clearly expecting something that wasn't mindless.,1
434," Very fun movie to watch! Too long so it gets a 9 instead of 10. I can only take so much awesome robot action, you know... C'mon people! Give Shia a break for once! You all wouldn't know bad acting if it slapped you in the face. Shia comes off as an awkward, geeky, and natural teenager...which is a GOOD thing. That's called GOOD acting. Not great, but GOOD! I can't say the same for Meghan, though. But DAMN, she's nice to look at! And in a movie like this, that's what's important. All in all, Transformers 2 delivers on the TRUE purpose of film: to visually entertain. You want deep and thought provoking stories? READ A BOOK!",1
435," What this movie resembles cannot be produced by a machine, only by a cow digesting a plate of beans.",0
436," Sure it was a bit over the top and over done in places, but DAMN the action was awesome and there were plenty of laugh out loud moments to boot.",1
438," I went there for the graphics side of things, as a bit of an R and D, and kudos to the sfx team. As to the movie itself... I ended up bombarded through my R-Complex... I totally visualize the marketing evil agents in a room deciding on the ingredients of this movie... We'll have ass and tits every 4 minutes, no regular women they're boring. Oh yeah the first shot of megan fox will be her greasy ass on a motorcycle! Genius! The southern US will love that. Also, we need weapons, kids love that, we'll bring in the biggest army in the world and bombard those kids' amazed eyes with tons of explosions, maybe they'll end up in the army one day. Oh yea make sure All the cars in the movie are branded GM, that's good patriotism and product placement, and by the way Optimus must be red and blue so that the kids can identify their flag with him... What else? Oh yea a bit of culture as well.... let's see... how about France and eating snails? Or Egypt, the veil and camels? Make sure they look real fucking poor... Check... So, to all those guys in the room... please just watch Bill Hicks on Marketing people, that's all I have to say. How about movies with just a pinch of brain? Oh that's right they don't sell... I wonder what Carlin would say about this... ""Maybe there's something else that stinks here....""",0
439," I have to say that the critics that gave this movie a bad review should all be fired. They have got to be so old and stupid to not realize that the graphics were amazing, it had action, was intense, and better than any movie I have seen that came out this year. Michael Bay is an amazing director and I enjoy watching all of his movie. Rolling Stone, get a new critic. I do wonder tho, did they all ride in the short bus together trying to attack a movie that was made better than any movie I have seen in the past 6 years. Stupid people shouldn't breed critics. For the critics that said it was bad, you are who Carlos Mencia means by a DEE DEE DEE!!!!!",1
441," I see a lot of reviews and hear a lot of people stating that Transformers 2 has a very incoherent plot and is loud and tedious. i have to disagree immensely. The movie has its kinks, i will admit, but the plot as a whole makes perfect sense: Decepticons need Energon. How? Earth's sun. If people want more than that, they will be disappointed. In my views, if the sun were about to be destroyed by evil alien robots, I believe there would be some destruction caused by fighting robots to either destroy or defend. Although plot holes were there, the plot itself made enough sense to create an epic feel that Bay seems to do very well in his films. The characters including the Bots were very developed, and developed well. Sam and Mikaela's relationship was shown to be vulnerable, yet it was easily known that they loved each other. I see criticism over Megan Fox's introduction scene as being too sexual. I again disagree, because her tone of voice and the background Green Day song gave an innocent outlook on her. I not once paid more attention to the sexuality, as i found her scene to be very sweet in tone. Shia Labeouf is a good actor. Not much more i can say about him. Optimus and Starscream were my favorite Bots. Optimus' leadership was exemplified a lot throughout the film, up till that one moment in which he....... spoilers. well, in all he is just a great character. Starscream's personality and how he acted was incredible. He was loyal , yet only by fear it seemed like. His actions with Megatron displayed how he is as a character, which is a cowardly right wing. Very well done on his part. Then there comes the issue over Skids and Mudflap. I watched their parts, and not once did i compare their actions to ""black"" people. They were funny, cuz they had personality. Racism exists nowadays only because we all pay attention to what racism is after MLK wanted to get rid of it. If people watched the characters for what they were, I am sure that they would enjoy their flamboyant and obnoxious personalities. The action sequences are perfection. None are too short, or too long. They are all gripping, and for me had me fidgeting in my seat. There is one particular scene in which Optimus fights Megatron, starscream, and Grindor in a forest which had me smiling and fidgeting; i never do that in a movie. It was easily the best action sequence I have ever seen. Michael Bay made a very decent movie. Not perfect, but Bay managed to create the ultimate summer blockbuster movie which people would not waste their money on. I happen to be one of the few who feel the movie was not long enough fyi.",1
442," Action, action, action. Michael Bay tries to put tons of action and a terrible story in together which is fine, but then it turns into a comedy somehow. It is so annoying how he tries to make this movie for little kids. The two black-faced robots are plain annoying and pure little kid humor. Maybe a bit better if the action wasn't so over the top, and yeah about 30 minutes too long. 2 hours and 30 minutes of boring.",0
443," This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The script was horrible, so was the acting. But above all the special effects were outright TERRIBLE!!!!!! I could see so many things that were fake. However to top it all off they stole from The Terminator, the was a transformer that could shape into a human being. Get real.",0
444," I am going to give the movie a 10 to try to raise the user score. In reality the movie rates an 8. There was not any problems with the storyline. Megan Fox wore too much lipgloss and had to have a man hold her hand throughout the entire flick. Other than that the CGI was spot on A+, story a B, the director for making look at that horrible shade of lipgloss for over 2 hours a D+.",1
445," Apart from the outstanding special effects, this film was very average. It was overlong, unstructured, and on the whole, a exploding noisefest.",0
446," This movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen, which is surprising because the first Transformers is one of my favorites. While there is a lot of action, it is all dull without any memorable moments. There is little plot and it is all very cliche and straightforward. The jokes, while slightly amusing at first, were repeated over and over again until it was painful. The ending was terrible and extremely cheesy. The best part of the movie was the college scene, which seemed like a sex-obsessed rip-off of Terminator. On the plus side, it's simple-minded enough to keep little kids interested for a few minutes.",0
448," You have got to be kidding me. Walking out is the best thing anyone can do who have morals and children. I couldn't wait til saturday morning came to watch transformers growing up. This is based on cartoons for kids for God's sake. The producers and writers should never get a chance to write another movie again. Most of us would wash our kids mouths out with soap if they talked to us in public the way these actors talked. It was a let down to say the least. The action was awesome, but that don't count for anything at this point. disgraceful.",0
449," I can see what Andrew H is saying to an extent, but why would the filmmakers only want to make money off of fans. A GOOD film should be one that everyone can enjoy. Not just fans who want a little nostalgia.",0
450, This movie was really good. From the jaw dropping special effects to the good humor. Transformers 2 is awesome.,1
451," On par with the 1st movie. Crappy script, annoying actors, cool robots and good action.",0
452," My first time to see a Transformer movie and was greatly disappointed. At different points during the movie there were scenes I thought were inappropriate for some of the 7 and 8 year old kids I saw that were without parents, which is not the fault of the movie but the parents that did not check it out. They possibly thought it was more like the first one. All in all very unlikely I would recommend it to anyone.",0
453," Far better what most of the internet is saying. I went in expecting 50% of the movie to be fart jokes and racism, but really there were only a couple jokes and the twins were in it for a couple minutes (and were far less insulting than Anthony ""I ate the whole plate"" Anderson). There are a couple issues that are waaay overblown. Overall it's a solid movie - Better than the first.",1
454," I am a film student. every day we watch and analyze movies to death, some old, and some new. I loved TF 1. but this has to be one of the worst movies i've seen in all my life. i have been watching at least one movie a day since i was like 8 and i can't believe how bad this movie is. They took everything good about the first movie and butchered it. theres more guns, more explosions, more ass shot, more babaes, more robots, more human, more comedy, BUT LESS STORY!!!!! tHIS MOVIE IS SHOWGIRLS BAD, MAYBE EVEN WORST.",0
455, What up with the critics every one thought this was going to be a horrible movie but it was awesome great story better than the first movie and great actors and great dialoge.,1
457,"With so much history and so much media to take insperation from. This movie took nothing from what made the original Transformers cult so mainstream. with plot holes, duplicate characters, inconsistancies. Not to mention no solid rulespsysics for the transformers race to follow, one minute they are solid bound mechanical beings. Next its a replicator from Stargate.I vote for dropping this bs and waiting 10 years for a real director, & writer, who has a clue. To pick up the licence and remake it.",0
461," Better than the first film, ROTF's main bad guy, THe Fallen was more badass then Megatron. I saw it four days in a row, with out getting bored the fourth time,.",1
462," I absolutely loved the first Transformers. HOW did the filmmakers mess up its sequel so bad?! It's truly saddening. Transformers 2 lacks the creativity, chemistry, thrills, and, most of all, magic, of the first film. I walked out of the theater more confused than I have been in the last 5 years. I honestly believe only die-hard fans and tween/teen boys would enjoy this movie. And that's stretching it. Many questions surfaced during and after: Why were there so many plot holes? Why did they have that whiny new character? Why did that old guy have to rip off his pants in front of the camera? Why is that robot humping Megan Fox's leg? Why couldn't I tell what robot was fighting what robot? Why are my ears ringing so badly? What was the plot? Why did that one robot have a beard? Why are those two robots stereotyping black men? Why are they attempting to run from so many explosions in slow mo? Why is Megan Fox's character completely different this time? Why did Michael Bay allow -- more accurately -- contribute to making this a terrible movie? Why did I waste my money on this garbage? Of course, other questions came up, but listing them all would only take up more of my precious time. Time I don't want to spend thinking about this horrible movie again.",0
463, I don't get why people are so negative about this movie. sure its story is pretty weak but you don't go to see transformers for the story. you go see transformers to see giant robots that transform into cars kill each other through remarkably well done special effects and this movie delivers just that.,1
464," The first transformers was bad, and anyone with the smallest bit of intelligence would agree, but this movie is just unbearable. the plot is a mess and doesnt make the least bit of sense, the jokes are stupid, megan fox has reduced from beautiful to slutty, its overlyloud, and way to long for it's own good. now, the special effects are undeniably great, but the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and get extremely repetetive and are only amusing once in great while.",0
466," Transformers Revenge of the Fallen was probably the best movie I paid to see this summer. I have read so many reviews about plot holes and robots who act like the stereotypical black man. Plot holes: it's funny cause I do not see one example of the plot holes in these reviews. Every time I watch the movie I dont notice any plot holes. As for the stereotypes, If dave chappelle or ice cube would have made this movie would it be an issue. No. Both have used stereotypes in thier films you know why? Because they are funny. Megan Fox's character was so different in this movie because Sam brought out her true self or did you not get that from the first movie. It is one of the reasons she likes him.She does not have to pretend to be anything she is not around him. The only reason I did not give this movie a perfect score is for two reasons. Number one is that during the battle in Shanghai it is very hard to tell who is who and whats going on most of the time. Second reason: Although she is beautiful Megan Fox's acting is not on par with the rest of the cast and it stands out. If you put a bruised apple in the middle of a bunch perfect ones you will notice. Some times its hard to believe she loves Shia's character. All together though Transformers 2 will blow you away with explosive robotic battles and keep the laughs rolling with the funny cast. A must see for anyone who loves comedy, action, and a little lame romance all bundled into a great movie.",1
468," The movie is watchable heart racing adrenaline boosting action. though the plot is dumb and profound. the movie has some elements to be watched. the older decepticon sacrificing itself. 2. optimus prime trusting the boy. 3. final 30 minutes of action. 4. bumble""s trust on sam witwicky.",1
469," Easily one of the worst films of the decade. Terrible story, horrible acting, and boring action sequences. I thought the first film was terrible, but this one pulls an all new low...and what is with the anti-Arab message in the film...how racist is Hollywood? The movie has absolutely no value....it was a very painful experience!",0
470,"A great movie, if your watching the movie you shouldn't be expecting a bunch of character development and a coherent plot but rather a mass of fun.",1
471," Incredibly Boring, too predictable and ultimately terrible. Michael Bay has done it again.",0
472," -No Michael S., the critics aren't lame dickheads. Most of them got it right. And how could a movie be great without a great plot? Plots are what make movies exciting. I think the only people who can really tolerate this movie are kids, who like to see robots, special effects, and things blowing up. -Besides the lame plot and overused special effects, the acting was horrible. Guys keep saying Megan Fox is easy on the eyes, but she's not easy on the brain. She can't act worth her life, and neither can Shia. The jokes are childish and those two robots which talk in slang are so stereotypical that they border on racist (the slang, the golden tooth). Also, like others say it's way too long at the end. -Oh, btw, the special effects aren't so great because they ARE overused. It's like the movie's creators have no sense of restraint or control and just keep piling more on top of more. -And for those who say that this movie's great and anyone who expects a good story and character development are hoping for too much: how come The Dark Knight was such a great movie? It's based on a comic book.",0
473," This is a new low in film making. I this is the worst movie of all time. i was so dissapointed in this movie. no one that has seen this movie has been able to explain the storyline with certainty. this movie is so bad, i want to campaign against it. begin analysis: why doesnt bumble bee talk when in the end of the first movie he had his voice? how can a piece of the allspark stay stuck on your sweater for 2 years and you not notice? why does humanity still not know transformers are on our planet when jon voight in movie number one had a press conference to tell the world? why does the film need 3 humping scenes where a character is humping another? that is a pathetic attempt at getting laughs. the movies overdoes the comedy. i hate the mother. why do i need exclusive scenes with her doing comedy? meagan fox needs to just stop acting and do porn because all she is good for is looks. ( i hate that booty shot of her!! i like booties but that was out of context! they waste no time in showing you why they hired her) the writers didnt even try to tell a sci fi tale, they told a comedy!! why is the only transformers in the story Prime? Imagine a Ninja Turtles movie where the turtles are in the background, getting one or two lines, and leonardo getting the only dialogue which consist of ""leadership dialogue"" and the rest of the movie is about human characters doing idiotic gags. thats what this movie is! ITS A COMEDY FEATURING THE TRANSFORMERS!! the ""robo warrior"" plot device is pathetic. what a coincidence that leo spitz happens to know where robo warrior works and ""what do you know, it's jon tuturo from sector 7!""-so pathetic of a script, i swear. the cartoon has more brains than this. the best part of the movie is the first 9 minutes, there is an awesome opening in shangai with lots of destruction but as soon as prime shoots the decepticon, the movie takes a super nose dive that a kamikaze pilot would be scarred of. the special effects aren't as astonishing as the first movie and when you finally get to the big showdown, half of the time is spent on the humans reacting and when prime confronts the fallen, he takes em out in like one minute. the special effects couldn't even save the movie and i hate the twins!! out of all the robots in the roster they create these ignorant stereotype racist creations!!!!!",0
474," the first transformers exploded onto screens fall 2007 and people liked it. i found it passable simply because the plot was understandable and Shia decent. But this new transformers in overflowing with little robots and when the film gets diluted with too many transformers, you get bored and stop caring for the film all together. avoid this one if you are a true fan of these little toys.",0
476, Though the storyline could have been better....really good action scenes and CGI make up for it.....I enjoyed it A LOT!!!!,1
477," Horrendous. A terrible movie with no plot only just a flash of pictures. The acting is awful, the comedy is juvenille and the action means nothing when you can't see whats actually happening.",0
478, This movie...just like the last is a big steaming pile of dog turds. Nothing but over the top special effects with horrendous graphics...you can't hardly tell that those are robots because they are so cluttered and overdrawn. Both Shia and Megan stink up this movie with their acting. Thanks again Michael bay for ruining yet another one of my favorite childhood cartoons with this trash.,0
479," If you go to see Transformers for an amazing plot and a great character arc, then you'll be fairly disappointed with both of Michael Bay's installments. But if you are coming to see some cutting edge special effects mixed in with fun and exciting action sequences, then you'll find Revenge of the Fallen to be a summer-blockbuster winner. While the film doesn't seem to excite from the get go, it eventually fires on all cylinders, reminding people why they'd pay $9.50 to see a movie at midnight: because it's just that cool. The only problem is you came to the movies expecting an epic adventure that you found in the first film, but with expectations soaring high, it kind of makes the experience less exhilerating. Bay doesn't shell out many surprises, but with the massive success of the first film, it's a little surprising that there's enough here to warrant a fair grade and, for some, a second viewing. We can all hope that with a third round of robot action, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg will find a way to reignite this series for a spectacular grand finale.",1
480," This movie is AWFUL. The first one was ok. Not great, but ok. This is terrible on several levels, not the least being the excessive 'comedy' racism that seems to dot its way through the film, which is LONG, dull and just plain badly written. Dear god... really... why?!?!",0
481," Michael Bay may think that special effects can substitute for good acting and a good story, but that does not fly around here.",0
483," Wow, people are unable to enjoy this movie? I laughed a bunch, said ""whoa"" quite a bit and the whole theater gave it an ovation afterwards. I went to see this movie for one reason: to see Transformers battle on the big screen and that is what this movie is about. It seems to me that the people who hate this movie have huge Bay issues. Seriously, try to find a negative review without someone ripping on the director....",1
484," Not the worst movie ever made, buyt not for want of trying. What made the original so good wasn't the CGI; it was the human characters and their interaction with the Autobots (or whatever the heck they're called). Allof that personality has been torn out with a rusted knife. The plot is basically incoherent, the transformers can't be identified -- but if you like boom, Boom BOOMs, you might like it. That's basically all there is.",0
485," First let me say i don not know why anyone would give this movie a bad revie. It is action packed, sexy, cool and stylishand not to mention some of the best CGI out there. Whether you are a Transformers fan or not you will not be let down. People are being way to harsh. The movie is loud, fast, and will give you a bang for every buck you spent on your ticket.",1
486," anyone who was looking for this movie to have a deep story or some kind of moral lesson is an idiot and should have their right to see movies revoked. this movie, like the first one, has the three things that make a summer blockbuster great: amazing special effects, beautiful women, and funny jokes. anyone who expects or wants anything else from this movie will be disappointed, but the story and acting are fine unlike what many critics are saying. transformers is not and was never meant to be a moving, deeply touching movie. it is meant to be about wowing the audience and having fun, which it does perfectly. this movie is an amazing summer blockbuster and will definitely be in my dvd collection once it comes out. AMAZING movie!",1
487," Don't know what these critics were expecting...Shakespeare take on Intergalactic robots? Come on. It's escapism, and does a fine good job of surrounding some amazing special effects with a decent storyline. If you're into special effects you'll be dazzled...the story's not so bad that it's distracting.",1
488," Loved it. The robot fights were much improved over the first, and those who are fans of the series and Optimus Prime will be thrilled.",1
489," great, energetic, thrilling, full of suspense and great fun...got a standing ovation in arkansas, and no it wasnt because it was over. Shia delivers his best performance since disturbia...",1
490," I don't know what people are looking for in this movie. Is it Oscar worthy, certainly not, but I guarantee you that this is not what Bay and Spielberg were going for. What they were going for is what we got, an action packed, fun, summer blockbuster. I say they delivered in a pretty great way. And please, will somebody tell me how this movie is racist?",1
491," Bay's hammer crushing a rusty nail into creativity's coffin yet again. Mr. Bay sucks the heart and soul out of every idea he touches and reduces it to a frigid, skeletal advertising platform.",0
492," As the comic geniuses who worked on Team America: World Police once sang, ""Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?"". Enough said.",0
493," Awful. The first was great, this one completely ruined everything. I could go on all day for why this was awful.",0
494, Movie of the summer.,1
495, I learned more than 20 years ago to NEVER trust a movie critic since most of them seem to suffer from permanent idiocy. Also as a student of the arts as well as a student of cenimatography i thoroughly enjoyed the Transformers sequel. The movie was well made the plot lines were clear and easy to follow the CGI was phenominal and the movie was just al around a joy to watch and you can rest assured i will see it many more times.,1
496, D C said it all-- It's a Summer blockbuster designed to be really fun for 2 and 1/2 hours. Some of the dissent on this movie is really pretty silly.,1
497," I loved it. I thought it was better than the first as well. Everyone is trashing this movie and I do not understand why?? It's a summer blockbuster. It should contain big action sequences, sexy women, humor, suspense, and bad ass heroes. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen includes all of those things. If you have something you disagree with in my opinion, let me know.",1
499," Gets a higher mark from me than it probably should because after reading all the stuffed shirts reviews, the movie delivered what I wanted, popcorn entertainment with comic book zeal. Critics, this entertainment was created from freaking action figures. Next time send somebody with a sense of humor to review films like this.",1
500," I can't imagine what a critic would want that wasn't delivered in this great film. Action! Action! Action! All the way thru. The multiple storylines all came together well, and man o Man! Did Optimus ever kick ass!! Even Bumble Bee got up in some Decepticon butt! What a GREAT ride! I may have to go back. Cant wait for the Bllu-Ray! Must See!!",1
501," I don't understand why people keep giving this movie 0-5 points. It's not a stuffy english drama - it's a stupid american action flick with million-dollar worth walking robots. The soundtrack was great, sound effects blew my mind (and ears), the visuals were breathtaking... the only thing I didn't like was that, apparently, Michael Bay doesn't use the zoom-out function of his cameras. I'd really like to see the transformations from greater distance. Still, it was a good movie, I left the cinema deaf, but entertained",1
502, I think the critics don't know crap about movies it seems that evry movie they say is good really sucks and every movie they say is bad is really good. I loved the first transformers and the second I thought was just as good!!,1
504," Absolutely terrible. Really, this may have been the worst movie that I have ever seen. And I didn't have very high expectations, I saw glimmers of promise in the first one, and hoped that they would redeem the franchise with a decent story filled with great action. That's not what I got. Instead it was a terrible, grinding slew of nonsense. I mean, I'm not demanding at all for this type of a movie. I'd like a simple story, a little character development - I mean, something to care about! Here's the problem Michael Bay has. How do you show two 50 ton robots crashing into each other and make it believable? Got no idea? Neither does he, so he resorts to dizzying closeups, shaky camera work and turns UP the volume. The result is that even the action is awful. Megan Fox exists purely as eye-candy. If you are going to stoop as low as this movie does, couldn't you at least get a couple of nude scenes out of her? I'm not sure why Shia Lebouef is even in the movie. All he does is run around, yell and sweat. An hour in to this schlockfest, I really wanted to leave. I even started to feel like leaving wasn't enough, like I needed to burn down the movie theater or something for subjecting me to that movie. I wish I could give it a negative number for the rating. 0 is way to generous. There is absolutely nothing, NOTHING, redeeming about this movie.",0
505," The movie was amazing, i loved the sense of humor the action scenes, the special effects. It topped the first one in every way possible. So far into this year it blows 2009 movies out of the water. Peter travers has no idea what hes talking about.",1
506, Why did Bay even put real actors in this movie? its seems to me that everybody besides the robots were just extra's. Except Megan Fox. She was there for the horny little boys who get sick of the cgi battles and jive talking robots.,0
507, I thought the movie was awesome. This movie has the battles that you wanted to see in the 1st one. this movie is about the transformers and their struggles and it showed that along with a decent back story involving sam. this movie was just as good as the 1st but the action i think to be better.,1
508," Terrible in almost every way imaginable. No manner of explosions can make up for a terrible story, bad acting, and childish dialogue. The movie's special effects become boring after maybe the first hour. This is such a letdown over the first one. Oh, and it's also very, very racist. My money would have been better spent seeing ""Drag Me to Hell"" for a second time.",0
509," Wow! it never seems to amaze me that we pay millions of dollars so that people can tell us what movies are good and what movies are bad. And they are always wrong (in this case Rolling Stone.) Is it not obvious that if the critics say it sucks the public raves about it. I wish i had that job. Now down to the point. Transformers 2 was a very well written well done movie. Agreeably i would like to be able to see a little more of the action scenes. Fast moving shots make it hard to see the amazing details. I believe it is only possible to see this movie on an Imax screen. I have to say that he problem of the two bots being degrading and racist are totally and utterly false. Who cares anyway! They are pretend robots. If you are going to take it that seriously then why don't you get upset when Sam's mother cries as he is leaving for college? that is a stereotype of a typical white female mother. Personally i could be offended that the stuck up army man in the suit was portrayed as a stuck up army man in a suit. Does that imply that all men who wear suits and work for the government are stuck up? No. It all comes down to this. It is a movie. You go and sit and pay 10 bucks for a soda to be entertained. I paid $11.50 to sit in a comfy chair for 2 + hours and when i left i was willing to walk right back in and see it again. That is what a movie is supposed to be. It has been a long time since i have been willing to see a movie twice. I would see this again in a second even with its ""racism"" toward the Chinese (by their buildings being blown up again by large creatures) to the black community (for the one gold tooth and funny quirky slang terms) to the white community for being an emotional, sex obsessed army drivin' race. Personally i am willing to let it all slide for the pure fun or being entertained. Thank you Mr. Bay. I can't wait to see the next one! Keep up the good work. If you're not a fan of the movie try watching Castaway again. Maybe something 3 hours long with 5 min of dialog will help you leave less offended.",1
510, Great movie! Very entertaining. The theatre was sold out and I can honestly say everyone was laughing at some point during this movie. Special effects were awesome. I think the twins were spirit lifting. We need more less serious movies like this!,1
511," While it's damn near impossible for any movie to be the best movie ever, anyone who says this movie is horrible is just plain ignorant. Yes there were scenes that could have been left out, and yes they overused the sex appeal of Megan Fox, but for a 2.5 hour movie, there was hardly a dull moment. This movie is highly entertaining and definitely worth watching.",1
512," This was a really good movie, even better in some ways than the first one. So what if Megan Fox is just eye candy. I could stare at her for hours without blinking and not get tired. If you want a deep emotional story go read a dam book or play a video game. All you haters need to hop off the hating bandwagon and hop off Michael Bay's penis. So what if it was long. If they would have cut all the extra scenes that try to build up a story the haters would have been complaining about that. It is also a ACTION movie not a DRAMA or a ROMANCE. Its a movie nobody forces you to watch it so there is no reason to keep making up BS flaws. I'm going to be looking forward to the blu-ray release and a third installment.",1
513, Brilliant Film. Full of non-stop action and excitement.,1
514, Everyone I saw the movie with were amazed by the movie. The bots were BA and lovable. The whole theater laughed at loud many times during the movie and applauded at the end. The only thing that bewildered me was how Megan Fox's boobs stay inside that very small shirt with all the frolicking about she was doing. This is a minor point of contention though and I was not disappointed with my $10 ticket at all,1
515," Is not better than the first one, but definitely good blockbuster movie, a transformers fans movie",1
516, action awesome,1
517," I tried to like the first one. I tried to like this one. There is no excuse for this bad of a movie being made on this big a budget. There could have been a much better story, and much better acting. The parts are all there, but the truth is that this film has no true direction. It saddens me to see something so great from my childhood taken down to such a mind numbing level. Then again, it is giant fighting robots......but at least there could have been SOME brains behind this movie.",0
518," Many of the more highly rated reviews for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, attempt to take a defensive stance on their view of the movie, by stating that it is supposed to be a Summer Blockbuster, and that you don't need story or well developed characters to enjoy it. I suppose it comes down to personal taste. I went in to this film having ADORED the first, even in light of being a long time Transformers fan. While there were a few needless cringe-worthy moments in the first film, (see: Sam's Happy Time?) I thought it was well made, and held you to your seats with a rather gripping story. While there were a few well-executed comedic moments in that film, it was done in moderation so that it didn't envelope the grander scheme of things. That being said, I went into Revenge of the Fallen with a great deal of excitement. In the first ten minutes of the movie, I was hooked. This started with a BANG like none other. Unfortunately it was downhill from there until the final 30 minutes of the movie. Without giving any spoilers, let me give you a brief rundown of why I consider this such an abysmal waste: -GangstaBots: I don't know who's idea it was or why, perhaps some ill-placed sense of inclusion, but early in the film, two twin autobots are introduced, and they are instantly recognizable racial stereotypes. Jazz, from the first film, was a very subtle move in that direction, but this was just offensive. Imagine crossing StarWars' Jar-Jar Binks with any character from ""The Parkers"" and you'll have an idea of where I'm going with this. I understand the need for some comedy in these films, but this was laughably bad. Since when does an action movie get it's kicks from genital humor and leg-humping mini-bots? -Too much cheesy comedy: I mentioned this a bit earlier in the review, but the comedy in a film like this should not outweigh the action in regards to screen time. It would make less of a difference if it was clever comedy, but the scripting has 'dumbed down' the jokes and made Transformers curse and swear just to get cheap laughs. Not to mention that the brunt of the humor is sexual in nature. And not in a classy way. -Designs: Okay, my only qualm about this one is the design a 'microbot' that turns into an R/C truck. When in his robot form, the R/C just looks badly designed and sloppy. Scratch that. He looks stupid. -Two Characters Sam interacts with from his college. One male that will (unfortunately) be there for the rest of the movie, and female that has a thing for Sam. Just watch the movie. Neither one should be anywhere near it. -Finally, the introduction of a human pseudo-villain working for the Government. While this worked well in the overall plot of the first film, it had ZERO need or impact on the main plot of the second. I've walked out of one film in my life, and to say that there were multiple times during this one that I wanted to get up and leave. Bad form, Michael Bay. Bad form",0
519,"Saw it cold today, without catching any of the buzz or hype. Didnt even know it was out, so... On the one hand, its Mike Bay. BOOM BOOM BOOM all over the place. On the other hand, boom is FUN, so. Theres tons of pointless explosions, decepticons prefering to blow shit up instead of hit people, and minor plot holes. On the other hand you've got crap-tons of giant robots beating the crap out of each other and occasionally noting how ludicrous thier own plot is. You're GETTING a silly movie that dosent take itself too seriously, has fun with its concpets, and is self-aware and entertaing. Unplug your damned brain and relax a little. And remember. TRUKK NOT MUNKY was stupid, too, in retrospect. SIdenote. Theres some minor contreversy over the twins and thier racial-stereyotype issues. One. Giant. Fucking. Blasting. Robots. For christs sake! Two. I honestly got ""Inbred hick"" off of them more than ""stupid black thug"".",1
521," FH and I went to see Transformers 2 at the Olathe 30, and for those of you who haven't tried it, I HIGHLY recommend the Fork & Screen of Cinema Suites options for movies there! They rock. ANYWAY, I digress. Transformers 2: I loved the first Transformers movie, I really did, which may be why I felt that this one was so lacking. Not only was there exponentially more swearing in this (Was it really necessary to say $hit and A$$ and F-bomb more than a dozen times each?), it was shot poorly. The angles were bad, too close for most of the movie, except when it was too far out (where it mattered). On top of that, it was cut like crap. It seems like the director and producer took a perfectly good film strip and threw it on some broken glass, then taped it back together and used that to ship out. Also, there were some ""new faces"" in the form of more Autobots. A particular pair of these, dubbed ""The Twins"" give JarJar Binks a run for his money as the most cliche, most horribly written, why the hell did they even leave you in the movie, supporting role. All they do is say ""Token Black-Guy"" phrases, made doubly offensive by the faux gold teeth and the inability to read. Holy poor stereotypes, Batman! All in all, not a movie I'd take the kiddos to, unless you want them dropping F-bombs and saying $hit every other phrase. Sadly, I would pass on this until it hits the RedBox... and even then, I may hesitate wasting a dollar on it.",0
522," What a surprise Micheal Bay still cannot direct a movie; actually it is not a surprise. The man knows how to makes things explode, but his direction of the transformers movies has gotten worse. The inclusion of the two punk gansta flavored Transformers have lame and terribler humour, which actually goes perfectly with the rest of the films terrible sense of humour. It is also a bad joke that classics like Ironhide get no screentime as compared to those hick gangsters. Micheal Bay also loses points for the treatment of battles. The decipticons are made to be cooler, but it is impossible to believe that one autobot dies as compared to 50 decepticons. It is complete and utter trash with the fault falling on the dirrector and writters, but the other thing is enough with Meghan Fox and Shia Lebeouf; they have served their purpose and Im tired of every spielberg film needing that un-tallented actor. Transformers will do regardless, but it shou;d not because the people in charge of the film did nothing to benefit the transformers legacy, and to Micheal Bay I say how disappointed that you think you are all that killing off Arcee just cause you did not like her. Total Garbage only because of the fault of the people directing.",0
523," This was the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot and editing makes no sense at all and I felt insulted as an audience by pretty much every dumb scene. And whenever two or more Transformers are fighting on screen it becomes a giant, incomprehensible mess. My brain still hurts from seeing it yesterday.",0
524, I came to see a action movie but turn out to be none stop curse fest. autobots using slang auto bots with gold teeth saying out date slang and curse words.weird auto bot hooker.this was really done in poor taste.,0
525," To everyone who didn't like the movie, you obviously had no sense of context for the story, the characters, or overall intent of the director. Sure this movie is not ""The Wrestler"" or ""Milk"" or any other Oscar winning piece of cinema, but it was entertaining. It is f!@#$ng Transformers. What did you expect? My only complaint about the movie was that Soundwave never descended down into the fight.",1
526,"Not just a bad movie, but somehow a harbinger of the end of humanity ironically buried in an $8 apocalyptic adventure.  Seriously, if we now entertain ourselves by twisting childhood dreams into visions of glorified war/sex/whatsthedifferencehere mindshreds, our end can't be that far away.  We don't need Megatron to skin us and give us a lobotomy; we just need an afternoon and our own despair misunderstood as boredom to lead us to Michael Bay.",0
527, A tremendous summer movie!!! People want to hate on this movie because they,1
528," I would actually only give the movie a 7, but too many haters have given it an unfair 0. It is not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be, or as good for that matter...but it's closer to 7 than it is to 0. Good action, some jokes, but there is a LONG dry spell in the middle which kinda killed the momentum for me. Other than that - definite recommend",1
529, Wow...that just blew my mind... i think i wet myself.. no seriously.. ridiculous...It's the first movie magnified by 7.. awesome..,1
530, movie ao fte year,1
531," Awesome movie! I have no idea what the critcs' problem is. It's fun, action packed. Maybe could have been tightened up a little to reduce 15 min, but not a problem. Bay actually zoomed out a bit so you could see Robot karate this time. Meghan was hot, but not over the top. My heart was pounding almost the whole movie. 1 moment of cheese towards the end, but no worse than Empire Strikes Back.",1
532, If there is anybody that loves this movie and understands the whole concept of the term sci-fi they will agree with me when I say that some people should just not comment on this movie cause they sound like dumba****. If you didnt like the movie then guess what you spent your money on it so now slap yourself. Transfomer's is the best movie out right now and if I could i would give it higher than a 10. Every movie that critcs bash on are the best ones to go see and the ones they say are must see movies are garbage. So for those who didnt like neither Transformers movie how you go jump off a bridge and hope Optimus catches you.,1
533," I make it a point to NOT read metacritic until after I see the movie. I just got home and was extremely shocked at others reviews. This movie is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time. Most reviews are complaints about no character development or it being overly long. Guess what? It's an action movie and actually somewhat of a comedy as well. It's not meant to be believable...it was made after the Hasbro action figure toys for crying out loud. Whatever anyone says, I thoroughly enjoyed myself and would highly recommend this movie to anyone!",1
534, The worst piece of garbage I've ever seen in a theater. Shia Labeof (or however the hell you spell it) is officially my least favorite actor. Let,0
535, Aside from the well produced CGI and the occasional funny moments there is no reason to see this movie.,0
537,"Like other films that Bay has directed, its big on action and incredibly light on story. Unfortunately for Bay, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is riddled with continuity errors, poor scripting, horrible acting and a convulted and confusing plot. In fact, it completely fails to construct a sensible plot and turns to pointless action sequences that have little relevance to the plot. Speaking of which, the camerawork in the action sequences is downright atrocious with strange angles that make the fights look like a pile of scrap metal flying around in a blender with a mirror ball hovering overhead. The cast don't fare much better giving awful performances throughout, especially Shia Labeouf who proves once again just how incompetent he is as an actor. Do not give Michael Bay your money, especially since this waste of celluloid had a budget of $200 million and this is the best he come up with, despite such a massive budget. There are plenty of other great movies coming over the summer that I am sure will be much better experiences, just not this one!",0
538, This movie is spectacular! The graphics are simply stunning! When I saw this movie it was just amazing. The acting is stupendous and i couldn't believe how amazing the graphics of explosions and the transformers were. It was one of the best movies I have seen! I give it a 10!,1
539," Way more enjoyable than the critics would have you believe. Hardly a minute goes by that isn't entertaining, even if the plot was a groaner and the robot mayhem was still hard to decipher.",1
540," Even though not as good as the first, is a good movie to see good Fx... good for fans, but last fight was very short and lacked some thrill.",1
541," To be clear, this is an ACTION movie. The point of this is spectacle; it's a ride. If you like robots, military hardware, fights between robots and military hardware, modern cars, robots transforming, Megan Fox, Megan Fox running, Megan Fox running in slow motion, explosions, female robots, motorcycles or destruction you will like this movie. I saw the 1st one 6 times in theaters and then bought the HD-DVD. I'll see this one 6 times in IMAX and then buy the BluRay with minimal griping about the visual quality. If you're with the other part of the population that likes to watch inscrutable monologues like Kiss of the Spider-woman then by all means go have fun fruity-pants! Otherwise watch this film. See-it! Love it! Buy the action figures and the Blu Ray. I only came back home to write this review, I'm turning right around to go watch it again.",1
542," Great movie. I don't know why so many critics hate it, I guess their eyes are made of fail. Anyway, internet lingo aside, go see this movie if you haven't already.",1
543," Ok, I'm writing this as a Transformers fan who puts the old toys and cartoons in the category of best wastes of time ever of my childhood. Anyone who does not like Transformers take 4-5 points off this review right now. It's weird, I'm usually picky when it comes to plot and dialogue in a movie, but even though this movie has one of the worst scripts in recent memory I couldn't look away from the screen. The characters are flat and boring, and to make things worse they spend WAY too much time trying to ""develop"" them. The humor is juvenile at best and completely stupid at worst. The plot is ridiculous and has holes that Devastator could walk through. However like I said before I was constantly left breathless by each scene and little bit of fan service Michael Bay threw at us. I would have to say its my favorite comepltely terrible movie ever and a total guilty pleasure. Btw, see it in imax for the best effect.",1
544," Absolute garbage. Don't spend your money on this, or we'll only get more of the same.",0
545," This should be a good movie. Wonderful special effects and CGI. Why do we need a love story? Or a comedy? Its Transformers! Action! The jokes were cliche and corny, and the comedy was very misplaced. It was like Pearl Harbor with robots. Only one man can turn a robotic uprising into a cliche driven love story with some robots fighting in the background.",0
546," I wish I could say I even liked it. If you like balls, farting, men in thongs, robot balls, and twin robots that make Jar Jar funny...watch this.",0
547," Incredibly vapid, over-wrought, mind numbing, catastrophic failure of an action film. Coming down from a recent Terminator 2: Judgment Day high, I can say with great clarity that this is a failure of the greatest proportions. Cameron > Bay.",0
549," This move may have been a bit long but it is worth the time to watch. a lot happens and the action is pretty cool. The characters are developed. it leaves a 3rd movie to be made. the jokes are funny and there are a lot of new transforms. i suggest this move to anyone who likes robots, action, and good effect in a movie.",1
550," Thoroughly entertained, it was funny even if ovethe top. lots of actions. more robot scenes. big battle at the end critics are crazy for give it a low score.",1
551," I thought this film was a great action film, yes it may not have the greatest or much of a story but thats not why i went to see it. This film should be reveiwed as an action film towards its specific genre. I thought the film was greatly entertaining and left me amazed, it has all the things you could want in a transformers film. At the end of the day Micheal Bay wasnt goin to sit Optimus Prime down with megan fox and have them chatting away slowly unravelling his life story and how providing a plot that has a story but no revelence to Transformers what so ever.",1
552," Really fun movie! If you like the first you will like this one. It was missing the discovery that the first one had since it was the origins story, but it was really fun! Optimus Prime is a STUD!",1
554," I went to see the movie AFTER reading some of the bad online reviews and I have to say I loved the movie. There was some funny dialgue betwen the characters and the robots and I have to say if I had listened to all the bad reviews, I would have missed out on a very good movie. So, my advice is go see the movie then make your opinion. Not everyone is going to feel the same and Im glad I didn't listen. I hoping there will be a part 3 'cause I haven't been disappointed yet. Transformers is awesome and so far everyone I've talked to has agreed.",1
555," Screw the fact that this is the best movie ever and is completly awsome. It has Megan Fox, it deserves a 10 just for that.",1
556, About the only laughing I did during this film was at how seriously it took itself.,0
557," Completely ridiculous that this movie is getting hammered the way it is. Simply put this movie was fun!!! Awesome action sequences, some of the best CGI in any movie ever, your basic mindless, fun, summer popcorn movie! There was a little element of dumbness to this movie, but was pretty minor in the grand scheme of the movie as a whole. It all comes down to the fact that this movie isn't trying to be anything other than what it is, and should be reviewed as such. Sure the twins were dumb, but get over it, and I'm tired of hearing how they were racist, or it was racist having them in the movie. PLEASE!!!! Knock it off, get over yourselves! If you're looking for a fun time at the movie theater this is the movie for you, it won't make you think or give you any insight to the mysteries of the universe, but you will have fun!",1
558," This movie was amazing, there were some parts that the movie could have done without, but at the end of the day what other reasons do u need to watch a transformers movie. 1 special effects, 2 explosions 3 meagan fox, and 4 TOTAL BOT ON BOT ACTION. alll in all bay out did himself again. AMAZING SUMMER MOVIE.",1
559," Amazingly, they managed to take a seemingly simple storyline from a 1980's television show and turned it into a big incomprehensible wreck of a movie. I understand that it has to have explosions and noise, but it really feels like they created the special effects and wrote the dialog as an afterthought. As G. I. Joe is coming out shortly, I am sure I will get two disappointing renditions of my favorite childhood T.V. shows. I mean, come on! How hard is it to screw up transformers? The T.V. show had better plot-lines and actually made sense half the time. That's high praise for a 30-minute cartoon. With a three hour film, you would think they could at least match that level of competence. When I saw the animated transformers film in the 80's, my eyes welled up when Optimus died (hey, I was 8). This time, my eyes welled up because they ruined a perfectly good story.",0
560," Action scenes are very confusing and quick, sometimes we can't even tell where is the head or feet of the robots. A lot of unnecessary scenes with ridiculous humor (horny robots, robots with balls, etc). It deserves 3 for the high quality CG, unfortunately all this CG is wasted with a terrible plot.",0
561, Michael Bay does what he does best: turns a premise with high potential into a glitter-strewn CGI-driven colostomy bag.,0
562," This is even a bit charitable considering the problems i have with this movie. First off, it doesn't know what it wants to be; Action, Comedy, or Drama. Its serious scenes are cluttered with jokes, its overly serious about things that are of little significance, and the teen drama is out of place. I suppose if your anywhere between the ages of 13-17 you'll enjoy this movie and call it the best ever, but for the rest of us who want something that really sits down and makes you think this is definitely not it.",1
563," Insane, not as pleasing as the first but still action packed. I HAVE NO IDEA WERE THESE CRITICS HAVE THE GULL TO PUT DOWN THIS MOVIE. Overall i thought it was good and definitely looking forward to a third if that is the plans. Good job to Bay for me.",1
565," This movie was outstanding, I didn't think that it would be as good or even better then the first one. Lots of action, comedy and it started right off fast in the beginning with action...and I really don't think a critic would know a good movie if they pulled it out of there a**!!!",1
566," I'm all for dumb fun. Transformers 2 aced the dumb part, but failed the fun part. This is the only action movie I've ever seen where I found myself looking at my watch and waiting for the thing to end already.",0
567," Ii loved the action, so what for storyline.....this is a sci-fi movies about robots bent o destruction. I like that it was not too long and not too short, I look forward toa 3rd.",1
568," Robots, amazingly funny, hott girls, emmbarassing parents, lots of action, and Shia LaBeouf. What more can you ask for?",1
569," Sure, the story line may not be anything very original and at times you have to think how unoriginal, but in the end this movie was amazing. It definitely is up there with the first one. The action was incredible and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. The cars are gorgeous and the fight seasons are sensational. Sorry, critics, but I'd have to say you are wrong on this one. Half to $400 million tends to say you may be wrong and don't know what people are looking for in a summer movie. Try again next time.",1
571," Best movie of the summer... and Ive seen it three times since it came out and has not gotten old for me yet. The thing I love about this movie is the fact that there are more action/fighting scenes in this one than there were in the first... along with more explosions. Some people may say that the movie drags on and yes at points it does seem like that, but that's because Bay is trying to show the influence the Autobots and Decepticons have on all the people they have come in contact with (Sam and Mikaela, The Army) before he ties it all together. I don't know about some people, but all this helped keep my attention during the movie... all 3 times Ive seen it so far. Also, showing what can happen in a relationship when one goes off to college was, I think, perfectly portrayed in the movie. Keeping that suspense during the whole movie helped to keep my attention and kept on having me ask myself what was going to happen. The comedy of the twins, especially toward Leo was hysterical. The movie could not have been any better in my book, it will be added to my collection right next to the first one when it comes out, and it is my number 1 recommendation for anyone to wants to see an awesome action film this summer.",1
572," As expected, most of the critics and even some normal movie-goers are going to take this movie more serious than necessary. Those people are missing the entertainment in this movie. I found this movie humorous with awesome action scenes. I'm not a big fan of CG but it was necessary for this movie and it bet it took a lot of effort to make this movie, so I have to give them credit for that.",1
573,"The original Transformers was so much better.  I believe the reason so many supported this was not because of word of mouth, but because we thought it would be just as good.  What a let down.  This is not a family movie.  I was sorely dissappointed",0
574," The movie did what it did, it took every one mind off every thing and gave a good show. The first time I saw the movie I told every one about it and i LOVED THE MOVIE AND WILL GO SEE IT AGAIN, Micheal Bay did a great job and cant what to see the next moive",1
575," I liked watching and experiencing the film of Transformers because it was like watching my childhood memories come back to life. Nothing on this planet has made me cry with tears of Happiness like watching Transformers in a realistic movie. This movie is not for newer generations that pick the world apart for their own exploitation of unhappiness. Most people I saw watch this movie were of the older generation of which they shared the experience with their children. Not all people dislike this movie, and for those who do not like it, give grave detail to why you do not like it, and then compare it to what you do like....the things that you do like in other movies, is it anything like this movie, or does it depict your own personality...? Every one has their own likes and dislikes and opinions, and that is ok with me as I do my self. But I would not go on a ranking system and totally discredit where the credit belongs. If you didn't like the movie, at least match what you did not like with an equal response of you did like.",1
576," Big explosions does not a good movie make. Revenge of the Fallen fell far short of the first movie, which for some people wasn't much of a fall to begin with. For them, it probably dug its own canyon. I loved the first movie, but this one was just a pile of trash. All but one fight scene was terribly lame, awesome characters were wasted and the racist stereotypes were just idiotic. I got the feeling they filmed all of the explosions first and then Bay got bored and decided to let his 8 year old nephew do the rest of the movie. Skip this and watch the original.",0
577, This movie was awesome. more action and more robots. i went to see it twice and i don't get tired of watching this. i might go see it again.optimus was a freaken awesome ''I'll take you all on'' was the best scene.critics could go kiss a**!,1
578," Transformers... ROCKS!!!! I knew I'll experience again the same excitement I had when I was a kid watching the movie. Though there are some questionable part/scenes in the movie. For instance, how come the Constructicon can still form Devastator when in the beginning of the movie it is clearly showed that Optimus Prime killed Scavenger. Also in the Dessert Battle you can clearly see some of the Constructicon fighting. Bumblebee even kill one of them(Rampage). But at the same time Devastator is in the pyramid, climbing. How many decepticons/constructicon are there? All in all though there are some questionable part of the movie...I love it, and will always be.",1
579," I do not understand where all these negative reviews are coming from. I have seen the movie 3 times and every time the theater was full or very close to it, and I didn't see anyone walking out or booing or throwing a fit about the movie. There was plenty of laughing and ooohs and aaaahs from the crowd, and it was easy to tell that they were very into it. Perfect summer movie, great special effects, hilarious jokes (so what if some are stereotypical, there are stereotypes in nearly every movie ever made), and acting that was just fine. If you want bad acting, go watch the Sci-Fi channel or something, there is nothing wrong with the acting or dialogue in Transformers. I saw a very diverse crowd each time I saw it, from young to old, and everyone seemed to have a good time, so I don't get where people are claiming that it's only people under 15 years old who like this movie. The fact is that Transformers is a great summer movie that has entertained a lot of people, and has a $200 million opening weekend to show for it. I think that some people just don't like Micheal Bay and are angry that he has made another hit movie, so they try to bring him down by giving the movie bad reviews, but their hate is obviously going in one ear and out the other.",1
581," It's simply inept on every level. Transformers: ROTF uses what little plot it has as an excuse for more ""action"" sequences (basically, two robots trying to destroy each other). I could barely tell who was fighting who, or even find out where the face was on a robot.",0
582," There are a lot things in this film which don't follow any logic (where are all transformers during last battles? It seems, Bay wanted to focus on certain events and characters and forgot all other - maybe it's a trick, but it's something critics don't like - absence of explanations and logics) but in general the movie is ok. The plot is pretty stupid, but the effects and comic situations make this film worth watching. Action/Comedy of this summer.",1
583," Fun, entertaining and gorgeous visuals. Obviously not the greatest movie going around but it provided a very entertaining cinema experience.",1
585, The first 30 minutes were good but it was terrible from there.The fight scenes were really hard to watch and the ending battle was twenty minutes longer then it should have been. The ending wasn't good as well.,0
587," Don't expect plot or good acting. Expect to be blown away by the special effects. Simple enough, no?",1
588," This movie was fully entertaining! I went in nervous because of the critic reviews, but everyone i knew said it was unbelievable! Whoever went in thinking it was going to be a movie with a Dark Knight or Godfather type plot was stupid, but the story was very good actually. It was entertaining and funny, exactly what a movie should be. They make movies for 2 types of people, 1)The people who look at it as entertainment and 2)who look at movies to teach us lessons about life. Both are unbelievable and this goes with the first type of people. Most of the people that didn't like this movie didn't like the first one either, so why bash at a movie you knew you weren't going to like? Also, the acting was very good in my opinion, sure it wasn't an Best actor or actress Academy award type thing, but it was very good nonetheless. And if it was too loud for you, there's most likely some preexisting thing for you, as it really wasn't louder than the first. And the action was not hard to follow at all! People just don't follow it, and there were no plot holes or goofs, I watched it again on my ipod from a dvd rip i found...if you focus on them you see that they are explained (Except the cast that Shia gets, but it shows Megan fox (Damn!) doing something to his arm when they show him getting up in the desert but i'm not sure what exactly so idk)...I'll show a few of them that i can think of from the top of my head 1)The flag thing in Paris: The flag that the Decepticon breaks off was on a bridge, the flag in the very next scene is on a building so its a different flag...there isn't just one flag in Paris... 2)When Shia gets up after getting hit by the explosion, they show his right side of the head, he got burned on the left as you can see when he's on the ground, the right side just got ashy and black 3)Megan Fox (Damn!) has her jeans slightly dirty at the end, not completely clean...although i guess it should have been dirtier but i can forgive this mistake as i didn't really mind. 4)The whole pyramids thing: The pyramd devastator is on is broken down, other transformers were on some of the other pyramids and the jets attack the pyramids...the John Turtorro thing is a goof i guess though 5)The John Turtorro under the Devestator's testicles was just there for comedy...anyone with a brain could see he was being sarcastic when he said it and it was a part of one of the construction vehicles he morphed with....if it was hanging from his neck you would have said they were bouncy jiggly boobs and saying he was under the testicles is better than saying, ""I am under....neath the big robot on the Egyptian pyramid!"" 6) THe whole ranking thing...it's a movie! You guys would also be complaining about how Farenheit 451 didn't happen in the 1990s oh well! He was important and saved America they could have promoted him because they needed him! 6) The shangai time and light thing: When they fight the decepticons it is nighttime and dark... Please comment and give me corrections or your opinions this is just what i saw while i watched the movie but i may have missed something or even thought i saw something.",1
589, Wow were the critics ever wrong on this one. Just saw TF2 for the first time tonight and now I want to go see it on IMAX. I thought it was just as good as the first one which I also rated a 10. Great summer popcorn movie with lots of action.,1
590," OMFG awesome movie, action was great, funny couldnt ask for anything better. All the people who diss this movie, you guys are blind and annalys into the story to much just calm the balls down ! Then maybe you will relise this movie is great. Michael Bay maybe a little loopy but is awesome at what he has created, :) go shit in a hole a deal with it haters.",1
591," Acting was average, some scenes were unnecessary, and the ending was a little abrupt. But the action scenes were pure awesome and there were definitely quite a few goosebump moments. A must-see.",1
592,it was really good !    10,1
593," This movie touched my heart and moved me to tears for the first time since ""Of Mice and Men"", and not because it was sad or joyfull either - because down right shamefull. This movie is the epitome of whats wrong in this now make-a-quick-buck platformed entertainment industry. Wheres the classics? Bring back the old ways!",0
594, Though not as good as the first it was very entertaining and overall good movie.,1
595," Oh my goodness gracious this movie blew me right out of the water! It has amazing action that is easy to follow and the camera angles are pure, clean, and crisp! Megan Fox and Shia LaPoof are all worth of emmy nominations. The story was super engaging and the plot was gut-wrenching! The humor was better then that of any other movie in history. Everything about this movie is so amazing that I am going to grab all my toys from my nostalgic childhood days, put them in a blender, cut my wrists, put that in the blender, and then drink it all and die happy.",1
596," I've always appreciated Bay's skill to take a so-so script and turn it into something really entertaining: Bad Boys, Transformers but for whatever reason he completely misses the mark and created what may be the worst film I've ever seen. In a movie that is two and a half hours long that is about fighting robots one would expect to see those robots fight for more than 20 minutes. You get five brief minutes at the beginning, five in the middle (though this scene is without a doubt the best action scene of all time, shame it was in such a bad film...) and then ten jarring minutes at the end. Why would the audience want to see two hours and ten minutes of awful, awful, AWFUL acting where the only interaction with any Transformers are with these really terrible racial stereotypes (I didn't find it offensive or racist it was just weird and really out of place and outdated.) The plot itself had potential and I'll give that it did make sense, but it was everything else that was bad and it took away from the simple plot. This film could have easily been cut to 90 minutes - it spends a good 30 minutes on Fox's and LaBeouf's characters trying to tell each other that they are in love and another 15 on some bizarre Terminator-like Transformer that doesn't fit at all into the plot. I understand that character development and acting aren't the reasons you go see a film like this and that certainly wasn't why I went - but you do go to a film like this for action and when its over 145 minutes it is sorely disappointing that a mere 20 minutes is spent on what the audience came to see - especially because The Fallen doesn't do anything until the last five minutes and the other Transformers (Ironhide;Sideswipe) do nothing and in the last battle its a bunch of Alien Transformers that were not in the film until that point. Its not a bad film because ""I don't get it"" its a bad film because Michael Bay ""didn't get it"" choosing a terrible side story that overshadowed and dominated the main plot and underused the very things the film is named for...but hey, had this film just been the 20 minutes of fighting robots with none of the terrible filler I'd of probably given it a 10... Just one last thing- Oddly enough I didn't find the film loud at all and I saw it in IMAX - it was strangely quiet...so I don't know where the critics got that it was loud from...",0
598," This movie is a prime example of why many people hate Hollywood. It's staggeringly long, obnoxiously loud, and very, very, very forced. After seeing the first movie, I at least expected a dumb action movie going in to see this. What I got was: Dogs humping eachother, giant robot testicles, a 50 year-old man wearing a thong, horribly shot action sequences, a very forced love story, and a script that could've been written better by Dr. Seuss. The only element that tries to save this movie are the special effects, and it's not nearly enough to redeem the extremely poor quality of Micheal Bay's grotesque directing ""talent"". If you want to see a good movie with great action sequences, spend 10 bucks and go see Distric 9, a film that cost a fraction of what Transformers did. 1 out of 10.",0
599," This is one of those movies that you should have no problem getting up to go to the bathroom or refill your drink. The story is not important and you won't miss anything. I would have had more fun if I spray painted a ball of aluminum foil yellow and then threw it repeatedly at a regular ball of aluminum. I thought my expectations were lowered significantly by friends and critics, but they were not. I wanted to like it. I liked the first one (about 7/10), but this one was totally empty for me. There was absolutely no rising action (and I don't mean plot, which I already discussed). By that I mean the final fight was not any more awesome than the first one. I would have thought this movie was far more awesome if I had left after thirty minutes. Clearly some people do like it, but please, wait for the DVD, it hurts me to see the box office numbers for this movie continue to grow.",0
600, It's less than meets the eye.,0
601, Not as good as the first....basically the same thing only more action and wayyyy longer. It was entertaining but i think they should stop here.,1
602," This movie deserved better though the plot may be a bit difficult to understand and no way better than the first one except for the awesome battles,it was still a good movie and by no means the worst.First one four stars, this one three out of five!!!!",1
603, OK come on whats so bad about this film i loved it and the animation choreography is amazing yeah there are a couple things in there that should have been but all the people that give it a bad rating that on bad moment is all there thinking about. seriously some people rated it bad because the robots made clanking noises. i loved this movie.,1
604," Now Gatsby J. I'm going to type this once, maybe twice. but here's what i say. the critics aren't Dickheads. You're a dickhead. the movie was awesome and explosive. like 20 giant robots kicking each others asses. what else can you ask for. i think that the graphics were, yeah, a little overused. but at least you know every bodies names unlike some of those other stupid movies. at least the movies are easy to follow. And also i think to many people judge this movie horribly because of the begining where there is like 3 new Autobots that haven't been talked about in the begining. But it has a great storyline and and an awesome fight in the end.",1
606," I honestly think this movie was great. Just because the plot isn't good doesn't mean the whole movie isn't good. Surely the plot was horrible, some parts were cheesy, and acting was average, but overall I think it was a great movie for family and friends to enjoy. It contained lots of action, effects, humor, etc. Visual effects we're detailed and clean, the humor was corny but still funny, and lots of fighting. What made this movie really stand out was the action and effects. It isn't the worst movie nor is it the best, but it meets my expectations. I highly recommend it if you are into action based movies. The whole point of watching the movie is to enjoy it, not seeing the plot and everything. It is a very entertaining movie as I see it. Why can't we just all enjoy the movie and have fun? To most people, it's either really good or just plain horrible. And to those people that say anyone rating it a 5 or above is a moron, grow up. It's a damn movie, there is no right or wrong. It's all based on other's opinion. Without doubt, this movie is highly underrated and deserves better.",1
608,"Micheal Bay returns to transformers with a even worse sequel to the original . i had no hope for this film but one never does know till they see it for themselves. yet again bay destroys more of my fond memories of transformers from a kid . lets see here we have a plot that even makes less sense then the original . more of shilo stuttering like a jack ass , more bad jokes , more pointless action with transforers blowing every thing and each other up who arnt given more then 1 or 2 sentences through the entire movie . with not a shred of charcter devolpment ever to be done peroid . i mean i like seeing stuff blowing up and giant robots kicking the crap outa each other but id also like to know about the robots doing it what they are like why they fight but no they basically have about as much personality as a rock em sock em robot. this whole movie was just basically a giant action jerk off fest layered on with bad jokes. this does 0 justice to the original transformers series . so yes if you have a IQ of a rock ,or like seeing demo derby's for mindless destruction , or are easily amused like seeing car keys or some thing jingled in your face . then yes you may like trasnformers 2. lets face it 25% of the population is retarded they think the govt. is responsable in making 911 happen or think obama is a muslim . so no im not to suprised that thoose same morons liked and payed to see this crap.",0
610,"I don't know what to say, whether it's the horrible script that tries to be funny so badly or the fictional stuff that don't make sense. And perhaps some horrible acting mainly supported by Megan Fox. This movie in general is really bad, but I can't say is awful because at the very least, the people of the special effects did a terrific job!How bad is the script you say? Well when all of sudden characters that were in one country, appear in another magically. When robots suddenly can transform into humans, that makes you wonder why the idiot robots didn't come up with that in the first place. Acting? Yeah Megan fox instead of frustrated or crying for his love when he is about to be rip apart in one of the scenes, she is actually watching with amusement. Oh and apparently the government has an awful security because those radars can't detect when a robot is near a satellite, or on any kind of ground. Ugh I could continue, but it would take me days! One thing for sure, I wouldn't be happy to receive credit as a director of this film seriously. And unfortunately, there is still a lot of strange people that enjoy any kind of movie like this, and FYI I enjoyed the cartoons and love robots.",0
611,"There are moments in this film where it is somewhat better than the last film in regards to better filming of action scenes and more Transformers but that is quickly lost. The stuff I didn’t like from the last film such as focusing on the uninteresting human characters and the dumb/annoying characters and the dumb humor. What makes this film even worse than its predecessors is there are even more dumb and goofy moments than the last film with some new annoying Transformers and human characters. Also, the film spends a good chunk of it focusing on the interesting human characters. Finally, the climax well shot better is long and boring. If you like mindless entertainment see it but if you weren’t big on the last one sit this one out.",0
612,"Oh good joy. Michael Bay at his best. ""At his best"" I mean at his best at annoying people who like Transformers and people who like to watch films overall. Characters are annoying cardboard cut-outs with no personalities whatsoever, the robots themselves have little importance whatsoever, there are so many plot holes that it makes the first film completely irrelevant and the action scenes are a drag and boring as hell, no matter how many explosions Bay can fit in every scene. I suggest just watching the first Transformers, which is a more better film to watch than this sack of ****",0
613,"That's weird, I was expecting the user score to be much lower based on what I heard on the internet. Goes to show this wasn't the worst movie ever, as there are a whole lot of other movies with lower scores (looking at you Twilight movies). Even if some of the guys who worked on this movie weren't happy with it, I still enjoyed it a lot, and hope the third movie will win some fans back.",1
614,"I have no problem with mindless action flicks. ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is certainly one of these, but that is not why I did not like it. ROTF tries to be intelligent, dramatic, and visually appealing, but unfortunately, it is none of these things. First of all, don't bother seeing this film for the action because the action is terrible. Bay seems to have it in his mind that the louder and more fast-cutting the action is, the more fun it is to watch, which is false. Although there were a few pretty good visual effects-heavy scenes, Bay rarely keeps the camera on one thing for a split-second and for the whole last hour of the film, which is just a brainless, noisy action sequence, I couldn't tell what was going on. My eyes were just looking at a screen with a lot of seizure-inducing lights on it. Which brings me to plot. It's not that ROTF is a mindless movie, it isn't quite that. Bay does have a story in his mind; however, bad dialogue and poor filming make the story pretty much incomprehensible. Fans of the Transformers might have a good time - I will also say that I did enjoy the first 30 minutes' character-driven humor and a few of the film's twists - but Transformers: ROTF is a huge backstep from the first film.",0
615,"Maybe the most disappointing sequel in years. I really enjoyed the first film, and thought it was perfect popcorn entertainment. None of the positive qualities from the first carry over. The parents, and all of the secondary characters, have become annoying. The sound visual effects are overwhelming and just too much. And Megan Fox is useless. So very disappointing.",0
616,"Wow, was this bad Transformers 2, or how to make a crap sequel Good Points: Special Effects rock, Megan Fox looking lush as ever, Fight scenes are awesome, The Fallen looked awesome and was voiced by the legend that is Tony Todd, a killer soundtrack (Green Day, Nickleback), Optimus forms with JetFire, we get the return of John Tutturro and Sams parents (who are both hilarious) Bad Points: Where to begin? The film runs for over 2 hours, which is way more than is needed. The Twins, nuff said. They're the Autobot form of Jedward. Bumblebee cannot talk again, so they basically ignored the end of Transformers 1. Sams roomate, Leon, is uneeded and annoying. Theres two scenes of dogs humping. Giant Robot Testicles. Reviving Sam, Optimus and Megatron as if their deaths meant nothing. The Fallen/Megatron/Starscream relationship. Bad dialogue ""Give me your face"", the scene of Sams mom running around on drugs, The swearing and sex references when kids are watching, Sam being a dick to Mikaela in the beginning, The amount of transformers which come on, one after another, not giving them enough screentime for us to care when they're destroyed. All in all, a rubbish sequel. I would've given it a 2.5 rating, but i'll be generous (like I was with the good points) and round it up to a 3",0
619,"HATTERS!!!  POR QUE???!!!! This movie was actually pretty good, if you a enjoyed the first and had EXTREMELY high expectation then maybe this movie deserved a 6 at the lowest. But 2's and 0's really? Megan Fox was not the only extremely sexy reason to watch this movie! The old cast is back along with some new faces, animations are still spot on and killer, and the story wasn't terrible. From an actual human beings opinion, this movie deserves at least an 8.   DEFINITELY  WORTH WATCHING!",1
623,"Great Movie! but the first one rocked . that's it. oh, found a transporter in france :)fun to watch: http://www.lookeen.net/de/352/allgemein/deutsch-e-postbrief-lookeen-stellt-sich-der-herausforderung/",1
624,extremly disappointing!!,0
626,"It's true, Transformers 2 is a summer flick and people who go to see it shouldn't expect to be blown away by the story. It is part of a genre to be considered as the inverse of art-house cinema: it's not really made for those who ""don't get it.""The movie outweighs its predecessor in terms of CGI action, which it is made to solely be. It is a movie about toys kids used to play with, this should be seen as some sort of ultra-high budget continuation of the original TV series intended for the children of this decade, only its film format makes it accessible for adults - and pure candy for the grown-ups who played with the toys.A demoscene could have sufficed to showcase the action sequences. If it were that, many critics wouldn't have bothered wasting internet bandwidth spitting all over Bay's face and instead would have focused on the more pretentious releases of summer 2009...",1
627,"This movie was a bloated, overlong and vapid sequel to 2007's Transformers, a movie that I actually enjoyed. The threadbare story is riddled with poor dialogue, toilet humor and gaping plot holes. The biggest mistake RotF makes is the exclusion of a decent human element to the story, choosing instead to focus on messy and badly directed fight scenes. Formerly enjoyable characters are now just one-dimensional caricatures who are there to kill time before the next robot fight. The movie spends no time on developing its characters yet expects us to care when they face imminent danger. This highlights another problem. The story and characters are so weak that it detracts from our interest, meaning that scenes of dramatic importance fall flat because we no longer care. A poor effort which will derail this series if it continues as it is.",0
628,"Why didn't they just blow up Megatron at the end of the last movie? Why can't Bumblebee talk anymore? Why are all the robots made from the all spark automatically evil? How could anyone fall from that height and come away completely unharmed? How on Earth did Optimus outrun the other Autobots, most of whom are fast, sports cars? Why are all the human characters either unlikeable or undeveloped? Why do Skids and Mudflap exist? Why is it day in Egypt? Why does film need to be wasted on capturing dogs humping? Why, why, why. Because Micheal Bay willed it.",0
629,"I dont really get the low marks over this movie,Or the Micheal Bay hating come to that.He makes great entertaining action films,fact.Sure,this isnt as good as the first movie,but its still very good,with still great characters,action,special effects & humour.Alhough i still think that it would've been better with the original G1 Transformer looks(especially Megatron in Robot form,& Optimus Prime in Vehicle form),& the original Megatrons voice.I found this movie highly entertaining & enjoyable at the end of the day.",1
631,"plot is everywhere, most of dialogue is flat out, way too much juvenile humor, and there are the retarded twins...Acting isn't terrible, the music is good, special effects are great, fights are great and Megan Fox is hot. Those are things that I really enjoyed about this film, I think everything else is crap.",0
632,"Having enjoyed the first movie I was really looking forward to this follow up. There can be few sequels however in the history of film making that have been such a huge disappointment. It is difficult to know where to start when explaining what is wrong with this movie so I we simply list my biggest complaints.1. Why is nearly every transformer there for some sort of (badly judged) comic relief? I simply did not find the humour in any of them, particular the borderline racist duo.2. Why is it so difficult to tell what is going on during the fight scenes? Sometimes it was difficult to tell who was who and there is nothing to rival the highway scene of the first movie.3. With so many stories to choose from the comics and cartoon series why is the plot so dull?4. Whats with all the slo-mo shots of Megan Fox? We know shes attractive you don't need to constantly remind us.5. Why make a movie last nearly two and a half hours and then fill it with scenes as pointless and unfunny as the one where Sams mum accidently gets high on pot?",0
633,"There was literally one scene in this entire movie that I found mildly enjoyable which is why I didn't rate this 0. Beyond that there was always something so horrible that they thought to add in that the rest of it was disappointing. Poor story, poor character development, and humor I'd expect from a deranged child, often at the most serious moments. Last, but certainly not least, it somehow managed to take my respect for Optimus Prime down a notch which I thought would be impossible. These must be the most absent-minded, uncaring, and vengeful Autobots I've ever seen. I thought for sure they'd do a better job than the first mediocre movie.",0
634,"pure mindless junk. This movie is great if all you want is things blowing up and Megan Fox filmed suggestivly. Come on people most of us are not 12 anymore, we shouldn't be suckered into giving money up to such a movie. THe animated movie was better than this and it was not very good. My friend who dragged me to the movie can go punish himself alone if he chooses to see the third one. They'll keep making them as long as you keep oinking america.",0
636,"Why the critics and some moviegoers are terribly underrating Transformers 2? The script may be bizarre, but the story is amazing. Michael Bay is a mediocre director, but this film is not very bad; i say the same with Transformers 3, Â¡it's a shame that the critics have underrated that film and is the best of the series! Â¡Fuck the critics!",1
637,Possibly one of the worst films ever created. Oh! Whar a suprise this film is created by Michael Bay. Can't you remember his masterpiece Armageddon. I'm just kidding his supposed best film also insulted my intelligence and wasted a portion of my life. Well I guess I have to say something bad about the film instead of just insulting it's director.  Overlong mindless action with no plot simply things blowing up as well as flat jokes and horrible performances.,0
639,"I had a friend a while back that made a good point about action movies; ""More.""  You can always tell when some producer told a writer to go back and amp it up some more.  When it comes to a Transformers' movie, that's kind of all it takes to make a sequel work.  What idiot is seriously going to be super-upset that the characters lacked depth?  Dude, you're watching a movie about things going boom because big robots that turn into trucks and shoot plasma cannons while talking with James Earl Jones' voices have come to Earth to befriend and protect or enslave us all... Things going boom is the point of the movie.  How can you give it a bad rating when it does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Things went boom.  A lot.  In all kinds of different ways.  It was pretty cool watching things go boom.  Oh and they have like some PG-13 ****tease sexuality on display too, but personally... if you aren't going to go all Conan the Barbarian on that, then I say stick to things going boom.",1
640,"Transformers 2 - Slightly more than one line review!First of all, I didn't really like the first movie - so I didn't expect to like this one. This one was better than I EXPECTED, but still not very good. Too long, plot too... ""ambitious"", story making very little sense, acting pretty awful, unnecessary comic relief from mom, etc. 2.5 hours. Wow. It speaks a lot to Hollywood magic how the effects (which are pretty awesome) end up feeling kind of ho-hum. On the plus side, Megan Fox is super hot and worth the ticket price, and the voice of Optimus is always awesome. Some good Bumblebee moments too.",0
641,"Terrible. I liked the first one but this one just went down the blow **** up for no real reason route. The first one didn't particularly care that much about character development but this one just throws it out the window completely. It's ridiculous and while a couple action scenes were entertaining, it's impressive how much of the action is really boring. The humor is stupid too with the exception of a couple times and the actors obvious puppets saying the words they have to say to move on to the next action sequence. At two and a half hours, it was really boring.",0
642,"I absolutely hated this movie with every part of my body. Sound strange but thats the only way I can explain this feeling. I saw it in theaters when it came out and hated it, then my friends wanted to watch it again on On Demand so I just went with it and hated it again. I will not watch this crap again and i don't think you should either. One reason for my hatred toward this movie is the plotline is useless and doesn't make sense. Just read a summary of the movie and you know what I mean. It's not just that though, it's also confusing, and not in a cool Inception or Donnie Darko way. It's more of a confusion that you have no idea whats going on but don't feel like figuring it out anyway. Like theres all of these explosions and the camera is spinning everywhere and then Optimus Prime dies but he actually doesn't, or does Sam save him, you know what I don't know and I don't care, all I know is Michael bay sucks at everything and to read up on how much he sucks read my other bogs on this websites. Then right when you think the criticism is over I have one more thing to share with you. The movie had soooo many useless and dull characters that it was funny. this movie could be a comedy, except the jokes in it where they were supposed to be funny are the exact opposite. So it could be a comedy for the wrong reasons and that is not good in my book. So in all, do not see this movie it is a ginormous waste of time.",0
644,"An awesome movie with super special Effects and super action, I have seen in 2009.Its better than the 1st one,huge battles and huge action is like the best,I've seen, high energy action and a big story.Michael Bay has really pumped up the action for this movie.I don't care if anyone hated this movie,they're crazy and stupid and don't know action movies.This is like the best movie of 2009,it has huge action set pieces that are so sick and exciting, enough said.",1
645,"It's arguably one of the stupidest films I've ever seen in my life, but it's a film where you just seriously have to shut your mind off and know you're watching pure garbage. The acting from the humans horrible, the humor beyond horrible, but I know for a fact Bay had to have known he wasn't making Citizen Kane, and I can tell that the people making this probably had a lot of fun working on it. Even still the performances for the Transformers are still fantastic, Cullen is still fantastic as Optimus as is Weaving as Megatron, and the inclusion of Tony Todd as the Fallen did chillingly well. And yes Reno and Tom were a little annoying as those two twins, but as everyone says ""It's all Bay's fault for doing that"" which is not true. Reno Wilson specifically asked to do make the characters like that and he even improvised some of his own dialogue as did Tom so you can't blame Bay for that characterization when it was the actors decision to do so. And the CG and action is still fantastic as always in these movies, especially the final bout between Optimus, Megatron, and the Fallen. And yes the humor can be a massive turnoff, hell it was to me at  first too, but I have since seen it again since I first saw it and I realized that the movie was meant to be stupid like this, it was the whole idea, and for that I say, it's a load of garbage, but by god if it isn't extremely entertaining garbage.",1
646,"To people who actually liked this film: WTF are you people smoking? This movie was goddamn horrible **** And I thought the first one was okay. Passable. The Rock is Michael Bay's best work, and then Transformers and The Island were sorta alright. But this... this is ridiculously wretched.It's just bizarre that his second flick is one of the greatest action films ever and over ten years later he comes out with this sort of colossal trainwreck. I dunno, it's like he was playing it straight back then and since then, he's just been indulging in his worst instincts and Transformers 2 is the most excessive display of that.There are actually a pair of twin robots that speak in ebonics, call the humans **** and one has a gold tooth for some reason. It's like two Jar Jar Binks at once. And yes, they are racially offensive, it wasn't funny at all. Cringe inducing. Ya know what, I didn't even find Jar Jar Binks offensive in a racial manner, just retarded, because I've never actually met anyone who spoke like Jar Jar. ""Meesa people gonna die?"" Yea, never heard of that from any ethnicity in real life. But the twin robots... yea, I've heard that sorta thing. It's amazing that Michael Bay thought this was alright. Sure, Jazz from the cartoon had a distinctly black voice, but it wasn't hitting you over the head with it. Jazz never called anyone a **** or talked about how he never was much for book reading.And Devastator was completely wasted. Here's this gigantic robot made up out of five constructicons, and... he doesn't really accomplish anything of note. At first he sucks up one of the GhettoBots, which made me really happy... and a few seconds later we see him leap out of Devastator's mouth and start shooting it in the face. And it's supposed to be this moment of victory for the good guys, but... I just got pissed that the horrible Jar Jar bot didn't get eaten and killed. That would've been so **** great.Devastator then just gets blown apart by one shot from a railgun mounted on a Navy destroyer. WTF? All that buildup just to see him clumsily trying to scale a pyramid and get BOOM HEADSHOT from some made-up CGI railgun? **** lame. Of course, the design itself was awful, it looked nothing like the Devastator I remember from G1. But that goes without saying, none of the designs look good.You know what was amazing though? Michael Bay actually attempted to put some sort of message or moral into the plot. See, in the beginning... the main character's going off to college and he has to deal with his parents letting him go. So later, in the final battle sequence, he gets reunited with them and he tells them to go to safety and they refuse to go without him. And he says something like ""Dad, no. You have to let go of me. You have to let go."" And that's when it hit me... Michael Bay was actually trying to tell a story about a boy's parents learning to let go of their son so he can leave and become a man on his own. But of course, it's stuck in a film that just showed two hours of giant robots fighting each other, so... that message is kinda ridiculous. It was really funny how clumsy and awkward it was delivered.So yea... the film's not good. CGI's great of course, there's this nice setpiece in the middle where Optimus Prime fights two or three Decepticons in this forest. And the blending of the CGI robots with this really natural setting was super impressive. Props to ILM. But the story and characters and editing and everything else is terrible.Plus, I was sitting next to a douchebag who suddenly started texting on his **** cell phone halfway through. I mean, yea sure... it's a long film, two and a half hours long... but that's no excuse for disrupting the theater experience like that. I was so irritated that I leaned over, nudged him in the shoulder and said ""Your phone."" And this guy turns to me like he's shocked that he's sitting next to actual human beings and asks ""What?"" Like he has absolutely no idea that he was doing anything wrong. So I say ""It's distracting."" Dude goes back to texting like I'm some jerk who likes being a jerk.It's a terrible world we live in. And now that I think about it... I saw him texting and playing around with his cell before the film started too. Of course, I just naturally assumed he wouldn't actually text during the film. Faith and goodwill toward man, I guess.",0
647,"I really enjoyed watching the movie... From the beginning it was tense and everything was unexpected. I also really enjoyed the special effects because they were very realistic and the fight scenes between the Transformers were done really carefully. The Transformers that were shown in this movie and didn't appear in the original were very amusing. I liked almost everything in this movie but the acting.. Megan Fox didn't give herself to the plot and didn't act as well in the first movie. I liked Shia's performance but the constant noise in the movie didn't really go as well as they taught it would.. After all, I'm still happy there will be a third movie!",1
648,This movie's plot is really bad. Watching the movie will degrade your humor level. Maybe the visual which is considered good has made this movie successful. This movie is such kind of bad when a superhero movie turns into a comedy and gives you shame rather than morality.,0
650,pretty cool movie. i like most of Michael Bay's movies and the transformer series. But the story is sometimes confusing and bad. But the actions are still pretty good.,1
653,"Transformers Revenge of the fallen loses whatever made the first film good by providing bland action, awful performances and overrated visual effects with a extreme length to add to it. You will be in for a long and boring experience if you see this movie. I give this movie 3% of a good movie.",0
656,"This movie's plot, dialogue, action sequences, and characterization was garbage! I would not recommend buying this if your life depended on it. Seriously, this movie was just trash.",0
657,"Transformers was a good movie for what it was; mindless action, a decent storyline, attractive lead acting, and cool looking giant robots.  Take away the story, replace the cool robots and replace them with the robot equivalent of a Prius, and multiply the action by 100x, and you have Revenge of the Fallen.  If Megan Fox wasn't there to distract me I'm not sure I would continue watching this movie.",0
658,"Absolutely appalling. A ghastly disastrous film in which you look at the screen but can't process any of the inconceivable storyline, if there even was supposed to be one. Insulting. Big stupid robots.",0
660,"This film was **** ass hell. When I was thinking of a score for it I was thinking a 1.5 out of 10 [my first ever 1 score for a movie]. But then I will spare it from dropping down to the ground hard. I really want the director of this film to get out of this world, I mean i'm so sick and tired of his gay films. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen 2.2/10",0
662,"I would say that this is probably the worst blockbuster  have ever seen. This is not just because the plot is awful, the action dull and it is horribly overlong. But the real problem this film has is the crippling misogyny and racism throughout. Making a stupid film about robots is one thing, but this goes so much worse. we do not need a slow pan up of Megan Fox leaning over a bike, this is a film about a toy for 8 year olds for Christ's sake.",0
663,"Wow, where to begin. This movie doesn't just tarnish the Transformers franchise; it furiously b****-slaps it until nothing is left but a grinning effigy of Mr. Bay. Retarded plot points are pulled out at every corner, the fights are spastic and unfocused, and the military is there to outshine the robots during every scene. In all honesty, it feels like Bay sold this as propaganda for the military. You remember the epic fights in the first film, including the showdown between Optimus and Megatron? You'll get none of that in this movie. The supposedly invulnerable, pyramid-sized robot at the end, who decimates all attempts to destroy it, is defeated in 6 seconds by a ""railgun."" I know it is a real weapon in development, but it is never mentioned at any point in the movie, and honestly feels like Bay crammed it in as more propaganda. Don't see this movie.",0
664,"Permission to Face-Palm: Approved. One of the suckiest, most tiresome, boring, lame, unoriginal and stupidly shafted movies I've ever seen. Maybe, it's the worst dissapointment I've had with a film.",0
666,"It's really hard to talk about this movie. This is easily one of those movies that everyone loves to **** about so by this point I feel like there's nothing else to say even though I actually like it. There are a lot of great ideas here, like the introduction of the first Decepticon and the universe building is some of the best I've ever seen. But for everything great about this movie there's something that holds it down such as the racist humor, or annoying characters. Also, I'll discuss this more in my Dark of The Moon review but it feels like the creators of these movies REALLY hated Megatron. Still, if you want a movie that'll thoroughly entertain you every step of the way, then look no further.",1
667,"The plot makes little sense, it has zero continuity. The characters are annoying and the dialogue they are given only hurts their cause. The humor is painfully immature and borderline offensive. The worst part is that even as an action movie, it fails. The action scenes are poorly shot and the final fight is over all too quickly and completely anticlimactic.",0
669,I like action so will admit that I loved a lot of this film. Michael Bay knows how to direct action and there's a lot of that on display here. What I did not like is the highly unintelligent attempts of humor. This film is literally one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.,0
671,"A terrible romp of bad race depictions and an angry robot that goes, I am MEGATRON about every ten seconds. It might be Michael Bay's worst movie yet!",0
673,"This movie finally provides the world with an exclusive insight inside Michael Bay's pants. During the most excruciating 150 minutes one could experience by watching a film, nothing will stop Bay from pulling his boxers all the way down just to show the world how big he is by randomly throwing everything, and I mean EVERYTHING he has right as it comes, whatever pops out first; yet managing to under-develop characters even less than he did on Pearl Harbor. And Bay's pants on his ankles also explain why the fun and humor from the 1st movie had become so gross and vulgar.",0
674,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Literally all it is, is Transformers and Decepticons fighting each other in hand to hand combat for 150 minutes straight. No breaks. It might sound entertaining to some people but for me it was just stupid, boring, and repetitive.",0
675,this movie is a massive disappointment  this movie took everything we loved from the first sequel and destroyed it  the comedy was out of place  the transformations was boring  i hated every minute with John Turturro in it  this movie probably destroyed the sequel forever  ,0
676,"I can't believe that Michael Bay went from a successful exciting Transformers movie to this. This movie was a real stinker. The reason is from terrible acting  perfect example (Julie White) a.k.a. Sam's mom  and a bunch of unessacary/retarded moments that draws your attention away from the story. In this case, I hate the fact it's so long because of the stupid moments and terrible acting. Overall, this is a waste of what could have been a fun movie, but is ruined by Michael Bay's terrible directing.",0
677,"I'm a Transformers fan and I'm upset with what Michael Bay for what he has reduced my childhood into. There, that is practically what the next minute or two will be about. I watched this around the time it was available on Netflix, I watched it several times because it looked cool and I liked the music. Watching it now I realize that this is actually a horrible film, with sexist, and racist characters. I know for one that racism is a big deal and that now a days it's a popular form of comedy. A lot of T.V shows do this, shows like South park and Family guy do it all the time, but South park gets away with it because it gives social commentary about what's going on. This film however only gives us fascinating visuals and robots made out of cardboard. That's the major problem a lot of people had with the film, some actually don't care and just roll with it, and that doesn't mean that they're racist or anything. I guess that and some bad directing is what most skepticts focus on, and praising the visuals like everyone does, and who can help it; like what Michael Bay would want people to say after seeing one of his films: this looks awesome. The one thing I enjoy in this film is probably what a lot of people enjoyed as well: the scene where Devastator forms. This is the pinnacle of the special effects, and it's great to see one of the most profitable Transformer toys back in the day have testicles. I don't think I can say much more about this crap that no one else has already said, so I leave saying this: I don't like this movie.",0
681,"I gave the first film an 8. That's how bad this film stacks up in comparison. And please dear god, to anyone who dares make a film about robots, don't mix them with toilet humor. Please. I just beg of you.",0
683,"150 minute all out assault on the eyes, ears and brains with no real plot, annoying new and returning side characters and the occasional racial stereotypes. Revenge of the Fallen is a technical Marvel but you can say that about any Michael Bay picture.",0
686,"Given the fact that I saw this film 5 years ago: I was surprised as to how I actually remembered it. When I saw it the other night however: I wished I didn't. Everyone had already identified all the problems with this film, the fact that Michael Bay admitted that an aspect of his film was ""crap"" practically tells the whole story. It's two redeeming qualities being the brutal and entertaining action sequences, with good voice acting are not even close to plunging this film out of a pit of unlikeable and underdeveloped characters, crude and sometimes grotesque humour, clunky and forced story lines, noisy and uncomfortable sequences thrown in unnecessarily, and a lethargic pacing that ultimately results in a tedious slog of a film; and it's not often I feel that way when watching blockbuster entertainment.",0
687,"This movie doesn't exist to tell you a good story, it doesn't exist to give you entertainment. It only exists for EXPLOSIONS, LOT OF EXPLOSIONS, UNSTOPPABLE ACTION, SPECIAL EFFECTS EXTRAVAGANZA and it lacks humanity. Weak story, weak characters, weak dialogue, weak comedy: Weak Film.",0
690,"It's hard to describe what all makes this film bad, so I'll just list a few things.  The action sequences are horrendous.  They look like exploding junkyards that you can hardly differentiate from one another having slap fights.  The acting (with a few exceptions) is largely bland and occasionally just plain awful.  Specifically, Megan Fox.  She's hot, but she has no acting talent.  The humor is hardly chuckle-worthy at its best, and borderline offensive in its worst, often resorting to stereotypes to try and get laughs.  The climax is wholly unsatisfying, with a complete Deus Ex Machina resurrection of TWO main characters, and a final fight that lasts less than two minutes.  Not to mention Sam Witwicky often serves no other purpose than to run and scream for someone to save him.  If I had to give some positives, it would be Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime, and the impressive quality of the CGI.  Other than that, this is a truly terrible film with very few redeeming values.",0
691,"It's noisy, effects driven action is both obnoxious and plain stupid. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" has moments where it can be funny, but the laughs are very few and far between. The movie supports no plot whatsoever, and its protagonist, Sam Witwicky, played by Shia Lebeouf, is thoroughly unbelievable, and is not helped by Lebeouf's lackluster acting.",0
692,"Sam Witwicky once again joins with the Autobots against their sworn enemies, as the Decepticons try to resurrect Megatron from the depth of the sea to take out the Autobots.",0
693,"Es increíble como la primera película es una excelente adaptación, si hubieran respetado el mismo estilo que la primera parte, no hubieran caído tan bajo, repleta de chistes malos, trama aburrida y lo unico que recuerdo es como un robot se follaba la pierna de Megan Fox",0
694,"Il secondo capitolo è sicuramente superiore al primo capitolo,con più umani,più autobot,più decepticon e con una trama molto più articolata,lunga ed accattivante.",1
696,"I just cannot watch this movie, or any other Transformers movie anymore. I used to be able to. I used to withstand the obnoxiousness of them and just enjoy the fun and stupid special effects-driven robot combat. Those years are over. After 2016, where everything wrong with America was suddenly maximised, where the country embarrassed itself over and over, resulting in the election of an unbelievably moronic, hateful clown without a hint of real knowledge of the political position he endeavoured to and somehow succeeded to obtain, these movies just remind me of how much I hate the U.S.A. Enough is enough - this not the real Transformers, it's a brainless imitation and a disgrace. I can't sit through them now. Even the special effects and cool explosions just look silly, no longer cool. The PS3 video games Transformers: War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron are my new source of Transformers entertainment.",0
697,"I think this time Michael Bay overdo with the explosions and slow motions ""Yea man we all know that you love explosions and slow motions also the volume up but that's just to much"" and in the background of the crappy plot it was just exhausting to watch .And the actors contributed alot to this failure Megan Fox play was so boring and unprofessional that she pass this mood in too the film .It's not only she i think everyone were so lazy this time they even use scenes that were in the first part scenes that were in the beginning of the movie they just didn't put any effort. And the biggest fail was the plot the hole movie was just no sense there are a war between humanity and aliens and they focus out attention to teenage problems and when we have to get in to the movie they messed up the hole story .And in the end you stay and watch 2 hours movie with explosions , fights and no plot and story .Total FAIL.",0
701,"It had the potential to be the best Transformers film out of the Bayformers series, and ended up being one of the worst films out there. Obnoxious humour, incoherent plot, and bland characters and dialogue. The CGI is epic, and occasionally there is the good action sequence, or good interaction between characters, and Jablonsky's score is awesome, but all this stuff is mixed with bad stuff, and it just doesn't work. Dark of the Moon has a lot of issues, but it's a lot better than this trash.",0
703,"The robots are all back: Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, Megan Fox. Call me old fashioned, but I like a little side story and character to go along with my order of big, loud special effects. Apparently, I'm in the minority, though, because the original Transformers made more money than I'd see in 300 lifetimes. So kick back, dig into your jumbo faux butter-drenched popcorn, and slurp your gargantuan soda while experiencing the kind of supersized mayhem that only Michael Bay can deliver. It's a question of whether the cholesterol in the ""butter"" will harden your arteries before what's on the celluloid can cause brain death. Going into detail about the plot will make me sound like I'm recapping the backstory for a children's coloring book, but here are the basics. It seems that, around 17,000 B.C. (early enough that it predates last year's Roland Emmerich prehistoric disaster), the Transformers came to Earth for the first time. There was some kind of big war and a giant weapon and the key to use it were hidden. Cut to today. There are more Decepticons (bad guys) headed for Earth, led by The Fallen (voice of Tony Todd). He has sent his minions ahead to resurrect Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving) and kill Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen). Once those things are accomplished, he can invade, get the key and the weapon, and destroy Earth's sun. Unfortunately, in his way stands a puny human named Sam (Shia LeBeouf) and his gorgeous android-like girlfriend, Mikaela (Megan Fox). Having accidentally taken home a shard of the Allspark doesn't dissuade Sam from attending the University of Pennsylvania, so that's where he is when Megatron's underlings find him. Much chaos ensues. he ""action"" is relentless in its monotony. Robots pounding on robots. Humans launching rockets and missiles at robots. Robots wiping out troops of humans. Other robots destroying the great pyramids or climbing to the top of the Empire State Building and aping King Kong. There's some unpleasantness in Paris, as well. For a moment, I want to say the Eiffel Tower is destroyed, but that doesn't occur here; it's in the preview for G.I. Joe, which was shown just before Transformers 2. See how all these films run together? At any rate, this stuff goes on and on and on, far beyond what's necessary for a brain dead motion picture that has nothing to recommend it except its technical prowess. We certainly get the point before the 150-minute mark. The target viewer for this movie is not noted for a long attention span. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will make a ton of money, Michael Bay will be lauded as the greatest director of our generation, and the accountants at Paramount will have their second collective orgasm in as many months. As for me, I will try desperately not to weep - not so much for what the success of a movie like this means to motion pictures but for the simple fact that I'm going to have to do this all over again in two or three years for Transformers 3. God help me.",0
704,"Now the first movie was great and it blew everyone away, so of course, we were excited for this one. We hoped that it would live up to the first one. Well, we were wrong. So, so, wrong. Admittedly, the first half of the movie is bad, but it was bearable. We got a few action sequences that were cool to watch. But everything goes downhill real fast after Optimus Prime dies. From there on out, its straight up boring, and the finale is very disappointing. Tons of boring dialogue and filler. You just end up not caring and just want the movie to end. Now of course, I have to give props where props are deserved. The visual effects were cool, CGI was still amazing and everything looked real. But, Michael Bay went all out with his Bay-isms. Racism, hot actresses and extras that he is probably trying to pork, and of course, tons and tons of explosions. In the last movie, there weren't too many and they fit into the movie perfectly. In this one, he went overboard with all the explosions. No matter what happened, there was an explosion. Pencil falls, EXPLOSION! Someone falls down, EXPLOSION! This movie also had an incredibly long run time. This movie is boring and it sucks.",0
705,"If you thought that Revenge of the Fallen couldn't be worse than the first one, you were wrong! Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is the worst movie ever made, it's loud, noisy, retarded and tries to be The Dark Knight of Transformers movies and fails. Fight scenes are hard to understand and the humor is WAAAAAY more offensive than any movie you have seen. And the finale was underwhelming, especially for a Michael Bay film. If you plan on watching this monstrosity, do yourself a favor and just watch Pacific Rim or the first Transformers movie.",0
706,Nothing works in revenge of the fallen it gets every single aspect of how to do a narrative WRONG!! it doesnt achieve any type of entertaining action because of the CONSTANT shaky cam and has some of the most piss poor acting i have ever SEEN!!!,0
707,"After I saw this movie, I sat down and put on the original series of Transformers and thought to myself how downhill the series has went. The first one wasn't all that, but THIS one was filled to the brim with racism, explosions and terrible acting. That's three things you don't want in your movie. I feel like the Micheal Bay movies have definitely shown new people to the franchise, but is that what we really wanted? I mean, the people who saw the movies first are gonna be like, ""Oh? That TV show SUCKED, i'm going to go watch the MOVIES! They were WAY BETTER!"" and they'll chuck the DVD away. Anyway, I thought this movie sucked.",0

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen takes one part inspiration from the Godzilla movies, one part inspiration from Star Wars, and one part inspiration from all the commas in the number associated with the budget. In a nutshell, my problems with the second Transformers are largely the same ones I had with the 2007 edition: the story doesn't make any sense, the characters are annoying, the action is dull and repetitive, and during machine-on-machine throwdowns, it's impossible to figure out who the good guys are. The biggest difference: 15 more minutes. Talk about self-indulgent. This movie would be too long at 1.5 hours. It never wants to end. Forget merely wandering out to the concession stand in the middle of the proceedings to refill that oil drum-sized bucket of popcorn. You can get in your car, drive to the nearest supermarket, do your week's shopping, and return and you'll be no less confused than those who stayed for the whole thing. Sad but true. Going into detail about the plot will make me sound like I'm recapping the backstory for a children's coloring book, but here are the basics. It seems that, around 17,000 B.C.

Having accidentally taken home a shard of the Allspark doesn't dissuade Sam from attending the University of Pennsylvania, so that's where he is when Megatron's underlings find him. Much chaos ensues. There is a famous term in theater and film called ""deus ex machina."" It means, literally, ""God by machine,"" and is frequently used to describe an event when unbelievable coincidences or contrivances are needed to move the plot in a certain direction. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen takes this term to heart. There is a scene late in the movie when we come face to face with machine gods who tweak events so everything will turn out right. There's a temptation to argue that, with something this blunt, it has to be satire. Unfortunately, Michael Bay has not built his reputation upon sophisticated satire and he doesn't seem to be winking at the audience. Now is probably not the time to heap scorn on the writing team of Orci and Kurtzman (abetted by Ehren Kruger), who are responsible for this screenplay. At the moment, the pair are enjoying praise for their Star Trek reboot. Let's be honest, though - that's not exactly an airtight story, but compared to this one, it's a masterpiece of coherence and ingenuity. Pundits have pointed out similarities in Star Trek to Star Wars, but they're even more obvious here, with Megatron playing Darth Vader to The Fallen's Emperor. And Orci and Kurtzman out-menace The Phantom Menace by providing not one, but two, imitation Jar Jar Binks. In the long run, this review will be worth even less than what John Nance Garner called the Vice Presidency of the United States. Transformers fans, salivating for two years awaiting this sequel, will queue up to see it, then leave the theater and get back in line again. The storyline is so infantile that it will appeal to young kids (or at least to those with XY sex chromosomes), although one has to wonder whether the length will be something of an impediment. The target viewer for this movie is not noted for a long attention span. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will make a ton of money, Michael Bay will be lauded as the greatest director of our generation, and the accountants at Paramount will have their second collective orgasm in as many months.

The special effects are still great, but thats all there is good about it. There is racism, there is skits and mudflap, who remind me of jar jar binks. And there is the story as a whole. I actually thought this was a good idea, with the new villain and everything, but the villian did not really have an appearance, and was only in like five minutes of the movie. This is the worst transformers movie of all time.",0

No amount of hot girls, explosive action scenes (which are offensively boring anyway), forced in dumb comedy or detailed CGI can polish the turd that is Revenge of the Fallen. Would not recommend to anybody with a brain.",0
715,"I'm no movie buff or cultural snob. I enjoy dumb fun, the emphasis being on FUN. This film isn't fun. It's an overlong borefest, devoid of humour but full of racist stereotypying, right wing flagwaving and poor acting. I'll give 1 point for the hot looking girl bot with the tongue",0

The script in this movie is so lazy, without it even focusing on the transformers, it tries to develop the human characters more than the transformers. The humor in this is just so terrible, with it being mostly racist and stupid, just like every other Michael bay movie. The characters are all undeveloped and weak, and the movie just doesn't go anywhere interesting. The only good thing about this movie is the special effects and one good action scene, that's really it. Overall, transformers revenge of the fallen is just a lazy and stupid movie,and as a hardcore transformers fan, I highly wouldn't recommend it.",0

The film starts well with an African tribe, a tiger and robots. A robot crushes a man underfoot - excellent. Next we move onto an action sequence which is very confusing - noise, explosions, slow motion and the camera moves around a lot. Then we move to the suburban home of Shia LeBoufe and the movie actually becomes physically impossible to watch. The camera lingers on Megan Fox in the most gross way imaginable. We see two dogs having s*x. Shia's dad acts in an inappropriately s*xual way with his mam. His mam is bumping gums throughout, just being really annoying. Then there is shooting and fire and at that point I turned it off.",0

729,"This movie has a lot of flaws, from the cringe-worthy dialogue to the lack of screen time for a villain that seemed incredibly promising to the countless annoyingly bad jokes, but I'm not going to nitpick. I had a blast watching this film and the visual were just impeccable.",1
730,"I personally love this movie, i can agree some of the parts go over my head a little. But other wise it's an awesome movie. All the characters have some good and bad things about them, like for example the twins Skids and Mudflap they can be funny but the are extremely racist. I also hate that they killed off optimus in the middle, They brought him back too life at the end but its still the fact that they killed off the most iconic character.",1
732,"i think this is the only thing on the site at the moment i gave a 0/10 because it has literally NO redeeming aspects in any department, editing, writing, direction, special effects, i became more and more anger which each scene because it felt insulting to the audience",0
735,"It's a lesser version of he first movie. They add some plot confusion ... probably to make the movie slightly different from the first one, but it just make things worse.",0
736,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen pulled me out of the original world, and these robots conveyed an apocalyptic sense of the end of the world, in which they looked strange and lovely. But when I was watching the movie, I saw a lot of advertisements and felt a little angry. It seems that our people are making money from other people's movies.",1
738,I'm just a 12 year old boy but...EXPLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSIOOOOOOONNNSSSSSS,1
739,"The second Transformers movie is ok, not good, but a popcorn summer movie.It has an ok plot, there are many unnecessary and silly scenes. the backstory showed is great, sadly the film didn't care of that. The action sequences are amazing, the human plot is ok.But in summary a good movie if you enjoy action sequences.",1
740,This Movie is **** and I refuse to put more effort into my review than Michael Bay did in making it.,0
743,"Very boring, with many unecessary sex jokes, Megan Fox's butt shot carries the whole movie.",0
745,"This one was so much worse then the first one that I had to leave the theater and make sure I wasn't dreaming. First off, this film is very VERY racist in so many parts. Also there are so many sex euphemisms that I'm surprised it never received an R or even an X rating. The plot, oh wow, did someone never even study up on Transformers lore for this, has to do with The Matrix and blowing up the sun... what? This was the last Transformers movie I ever went to see, predicting that others would follow the same formula. That's right, after the first one they all just follow the same plot structure and don't do anything different.",0
