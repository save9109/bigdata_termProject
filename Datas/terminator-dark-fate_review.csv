0,"I have an idea, let's make a movie, keep the plot the same as 4 out of 5 of the past previous movies, and gender swap the main characters. What could go wrong?! No spoilers here as we all know the plot (its in the trailers), robot comes from future to kill hero before they can save the world, send good guy back to stop the bad robot... THINK OF SOMETHING ORIGINAL FFS!!! T1 was the best because it was original, T2 was great because it flipped the script, T3, T5 and T6 are cash grabs that can't think of anything new! T4 tried to do something a little new but still relied too much on star power and not enough on good characters. Character development is what's wrong with Hollywood today, they don't know how to write good characters and fall into tired old tropes.",0
1,Loved Linda Hamilton loved Arnold even though his character was not presented in a decent way. I hated the killing off of John Connor that was an ultimate slap in the face to all Terminator fans of the franchise so that’s unforgivable also Grace was a mediocre character but Dany Ramos was the singular worst of the characters in the whole movie. Rev 9 was not a convincing scary Terminator although he has great action moments. Overall the movie grade fro this is a D-,0
2,"Basically throws the narrative of every other Terminator movie out of the window and replaces it by dull, forgettable characters and a future world we get two glimpes of and no-one cares about. By both my friend and I had literally forgotten the name of the protagonist, she's that boring and unworthy.Plot makes no sense and gets repetitive very fast. Basically the entire movie is one long chase that repeats itself. Terminator and protagonists get in a fight, a spectacular explosion knocks everyone out and allow the protagonists to get some distance, Terminator reforms, protagonists go from unconscious to fully operational in 5 seconds, Terminator starts chasing again.The new Terminator model has some new capability and can operate in two different modes, but it is not really shown what the difference/advantages of the two different modes are and the whole thing just seems completely invulnerable anyway. In the end, the way it is defeated makes the whole movie seem utterly pointless.",0
3,"Tragic.Completely disrespectful to everything the franchise was built upon. It's John Connor's story, instead he's used here as an insignificant add on to pass his story onto a new female version who was terribly cast. Similarly Arnold, he's only here to help sell tickets and the Terminator character is a mockery of the first two films.There is nothing original here or anything you have to see: it's a blend of the first movies remade, but much worse.",0
4,Another remake of T1/T2 that nobody wants or asked for. It lacks creativity and imagination. Its plot is dull and full of nonsense. This franchise should have ended with T2 followed perhaps by a kind of prequel/sequel leading to T1. But the worst thing in this is Cameron's hypocrisy. Do you remember him bragging around about how Fincher killed his beloved characters in Alien 3. Well be ready for the same in the Dark Fate and now it's done and approved by king of the world himself.,0
5,"Don't see this movie. This movie is insulting to fans of the first 2 Terminator movies from the first 5 minutes.This whole movie is just a feminist propaganda, replacing John Connor (THE KEY CHARACTER OF THE SAGA) with a Mexican girl.And also insults and makes the T-800 look like a jester, no longer intimidates and is now a joke in bad taste.",0
6,"Next soft reboot, the first part of the trilogy without logic and lots of plotholes (again), unrealistic action sequences, without Skynet (Genysis or Legion, same crap) and Connor existence is changed (again)... dialogs are really bad.If you don't want to think about plot, don't mind that the T800 is just a super man, not a terminator and you dont expecting chilling atmosphere, go and watch it.Same mistakes all over again like with Genysis. They should stop it and sell it to someone other than Paramount and Skydance. Never again.",0
7,"The first 20 seconds of this movie is a big slap to the face of all terminator fans. Know your target audience Tim Miller. Highly highly suggest if you’re a terminator fan to not watch this movie, ever.",0
8,"Awful... destroys the legacy of some of my favourite movies and replaces it was shallow copy of the story of T2 but with an androgynous protector, an implausible saviour of humanity and the worst, lamest, least threatening Terminator (with some trash effects) in any of the movies. RIP Skynet....",0
9,"Wow, what amazing garbage this movie is. James Cameron has lost my respect with this horrible re-make/ ripoff of T2 but done 1000000x worse.  don't watch this, EVER!! T1 and T2 are the only real Terminator movies that exist.  Glad this is failing in the Box Office.",0
10,"Terrible writing, ancient CGI... and we’re talking about a guy who spawned BLUR Studio in late 90s and their cinematics for game trailers knowadays looks better then Rev9. What’s in the box? Forced appearances of Arnie and Sarah (but she’s so underdeveloped as a character that it hurts), a finger to the fans of John Connor, dialogues hurting my ears... it’s bad writing. And the ending... gosh, It’s Genisys all over again. I must say this, since first scene on the beach I’ve felt disconnected, nothing made me interested In next act and these two points of this review are only for deaged sequence. Sorry, Terminator franchise is now dead. People change, that’s why Cameron can’t guarantee us a good movie anymore. He praised Genisys (which at this point I like more) before, he rightly bought the rights to this franchise after last one flopped and nothing has changed.",0
11,Disaster. Linda Hamilton is ELDERLY and overacts badly the whole tough guy role. Is she wearing a diaper?..The LGBT-1000 blonde girl is whiny and terrible ...cant act....plotholes EVERYWHERE...bad directing....P-U-N-T already.,0
12,"My goodness what a poor movie. Can't believe I spent money on this. Poor story, unbelievable acting, poor directing and things that happen in the movie that is simply unbelievable even within the context of the Terminator Universe. Avoid!",0
13,"It's an  ok action Movie, but an AWFUL Terminator.Plot holes and the many inconsistencys of the story got me out of the movie. Too many dumb things. If you have to watch it, be sure to put your brain in a bag before, if you want to enjoy it.If in the future i have to rewatch it, i'll put my second degree hat on, and watch it like i watched The Room.",0
14,truly awful. t1+t2+scc = all i need. to kill of john conner like that and ruin everything like this movie was just stupid.,0
15,It's no better and no worse Terminator Genisys. They destroyed the franchise. Please do not make any more films.,0
16,This movie it's a waste of potential. A waste of characters and it's sole reason to exist is to sell tickets whilst relying too heavily on nostalgia.,0
17,The storyline completely broken. Genesis is no longer the worst movie in the franchise.,0
18,"Really bad movie, unbelievable acting, bad casting, weak plot, obvious mistakes. Good effects though",0
19,the main characters all act very stupid and antagonistic. after 20 minutes i just wanted them to be killed by the terminator. they act like really bad people all the time,0
20,Uninteresting characters and terrible action. I pray to forget this movie. Would’ve gladly taken a sequel to Terminator Salvation over this mess,0
21,"I liked a the Terminator movies so far, of course T2 beeing my favourite. But this one ? Starts strong, but goes downhill in act 2 and 3 when it becomes  convoluted and more of the same. Arnolds character just doesnt work.",0
22,Do you want to know how to kill the franchise? Just go watch this movie.At least Sarah Connor stills being Sarah Connor.,0
23,"Happy to see Linda Hamilthon again, but i've really don't like the story.I don't understand how it can be in Terminator timeline.",0
24,"It was embarrassing to watch! Bad one-liners, bad actors, no story, couldnt care less if everyone died. T2 was a masterpiece and looked insanely good, cool and minimalistic while this looked something of a fan-made (no offence), no budget, edited to pieces with soap actors. Stay away!",0
25,"The world is gone. Skynet has won, developing an advanced random cliché generator with their machine learning algorithms, which served to create a script for a film with 3 stereotypical strong alpha female lead roles being chased by Mexican terminator, and now the only hope for humanity lies in another chosen one who will hopefully come back from the future to prevent me from being born, so I wouldn't have to live with memories of this equality preaching abomination pretty accurately called Dark Fate. Or I guess he could even kill me, cause I don't care at all at this point, to be honest.",0
26,"t800 is a joke, has a dog, a wife, a son and a stupid job (decorator), the red 9 is a Mexican man with innocent face.....the CGI is bad and cheap....this movie is a disaster...",0
27,"This movie lost my attention about halfway through (and even struggled to keep it that long). It lacked an interesting plot beyond the usuals (yes, this is, sadly,  where we've come to). They basically remade T2 but took away the emotion and physical palpability of the original masterpiece and substituted it with mundane bickering and surprisingly bad and overused CGI (not terrible, just a lot worse than I expected from a movie I would consider to be a high-profile flick). It suffers from the exact same thing as most modern action movies; the action is so intense and so choreographed, that it becomes silly. It lacks physical weight and feel.Dark Fate is a moped on a racing track.RIP Terminator franchise.",0
28,"I have liked all the Terminator movies, except Genesys, they took the sweet Emilia Clarke and turned her in to a neo feminist nagger, unforgivable.  So, this was $200m budget and directed by Time Miller who made Deadpool which i thought was corny but worth seeing.  first of all, the camera angles change either too fast or in the wrong orientation, because it feels like chop suey to watch.  The cgi is absolutely awful, an early shot has a sack lunch turn into a pistol.  Both terminators are generic, it starts looking like a Home Depot commercial.  The female Kyle Reese has potential but she is too rushed in behavior, Kyle was cool in that he was never in a hurry no matter how crazy the situation.  Linda Hamilton is always great but everything feels choreographed, like Sully when the plane landed perfectly after 17 attempts.  I don't know how Spanish people became the focus, an explanation would have been nice beforehand.  I think for Hollywood feminism is a gimmick, which is a bummer because there are a lot of brave women fighting for a place in the world.  Biggest plot hole: Linda asks who the girl is, she says nobody, ok why did Linda know where to look? This movie is an excellent opportunity to study script writing. Roger Corman said #1 rule is have a good script, I may not know what that is but this movie shows what is is not. Movies like this are a great lesson in how it could go wrong. The dialog is horrendous, characters denigrating each other is never a good sign.  I made it to 40 minutes in this movie, had to quit.  I very rarely don't watch the whole thing.",0
29,Nothing new.. same old same old great special effects but story line is hurting,0
30,"Exterminador do Futuro onde John Connor NÃO é o ""futuro da humanidade"" não é Exterminador.A tentativa de atrair o público feminista enchendo de protagonistas femininas ""fortes"" conseguiu entregar um resultado pior que os últimos dois filmes para exterminar de vez a franquia. Parabéns!",0
31,"Horrible movie, horrible and stupide Story, horrible action scenes, nothing good on this movie... NOTHING.",0
32,Worst Movie I have ever seen in the theatre. I regret every single penny i've spent on the ticket. Its just a shame what they have done to the Terminator Franchise.,0
33,I hate this movie so much replacing everything I love in Terminator 1-2 with a Woke Feminist Propaganda flick don't waste your time on this crap.,0
34,"Nonsensical & bad film without soul.Typical franchise now being milked for all its worth by Hollywood with bad sequels.- Nonsensical plot.- From beginning to end, a succession of cheap action sequences filled with CGI, worthy of the lowest IQ direct-to-dvd action films.Skip entirely. Even T3 and T4 are worth wasting 2 hours on, not this film which is the worst in the franchise. Shame on Hollywood for even making this garbage.",0
35,"This is the worst terminator of them all, major problems with this movie for any person especially those that have watched the original terminator, it dull and makes no sense, graphics were ok but the major problem with this movie is the story, it has already been told 4 times, The dialogue is pretty bad, Sarrah Connor thinking that putting your phone in a bag of potatoe chips will block out the tracking signal was pretty dumb and unrealistic, anyone knows a phone works inside a building and a small foil will not help block out the signal, she was also shown to be very smart in judgement day and she teach john connor to hack, Arnold helped the movie but not by much, only making it more enjoyable when he came for nostalgia reasons, but even he can't save this sinking ship. Story spoiler alert - they kill the main hero to be John Conner in the first few minutes and replace the hero to be with a girl name Dani which is ok if it had a reason she was going to be the main hero, but unfortunately this movie is Woke no matter how you look at it, the original John Conner was great with computers because his mum teaches him how to break and hack them, as seen when he got cash when he hacked the ATM, Dani though doesn't have any pre-requisites to replace John Connor or anyone, she cannot shoot a gun, she can't hack, all it show in the beginning is she is complaining that robots are taking people jobs at the factory she working at and she was going to complain to the manager, she doesn't have the character to become any leader, this isn't the movie that fans wanted, this is the same old story retold 5 times already but worst, fans want to know about the future war with skynet, how did humanity win against the computers, we couldn't out breed them as a human take at least 10 years to grow to be able to fight, did we disrupt the mining supplies, factories? This are questions the fans actually want answered, example: we keep getting alien retold and worst each time but we want aliens and to see how skynet works, there life, mining/manufacturing etc, the story does not move on, terminator franchise as funny as it seems it is stuck in it own time loop but degrading each time the story is told.",0
36,"Within just a few minutes, this movie destroyed what the rest spent decades building. This was simply a girl power Terminator movie. A complete and total waste of my money & my time.",0
37,"*Massive Spoilers*After basing the whole story on one person, now you're trying to kill him (John Connor, the hero) off and replacing him with a taco eating ****No thank you, that **** is not acceptable.And why would she (the taco eating **** bond with the psycho **** (the one from the future) within 24 hours enough to sleep on her lap?Insane is why! Stockholm syndrome!And why isn't the psycho **** (the one from the future) packing a Red Bull or two if it's well known that she runs out of juice every 5 minutes?And why would the taco eating **** and the psycho **** (the one from the future) save the Terminator (Carl, the original Terminator) when Sarah tried to shoot him? Even though the psycho **** (the one from the future) is supposed to kill all Terminators to save the taco eating ****.And why would she (the taco eating **** cry and tell her she saved her life when the psycho **** (the one from the future) dies? When clearly THE MAN (The original Terminator) saved her taco eating ass!And how come they (Sarah Connor and the taco eating **** were watching the explosion of the power cell that killed the new Terminator and Carl (The original Terminator) from about 20 meters distance? When previous explosions from power cells have taken out city blocks!??And why didn't you make the CGI better looking, more realistic? From the moment the Terminators walked up from the sea it did not look good (real).I am glad I didn't pay to see this movie.I have paid for the previous movies, several times. I went to the premiers on cinema and then got the DVD's, later the Bluray's, special editions and ****.But this **** just ain't worth it!You totally killed The Terminator now, this used to be kick-ass action!",0
38,Лучше я бы пробухал те деньги которые потратил на билет этого Дерминатора!,0
39,"I'm tired of seeing movies with old wrinkly people.  No-one needs to see ARRI ALEXA LF 4.5k melanoma spots...just shoot these on film. Action scenes are cut so fast and full of crap one-liners I thought I was watching A Good Day to Die Hard. CGI was annoying . Some shots of the evil terminator during the final fight looked creepy and really detailed and rendered well but the consistency of the CGI was like the Hobbit trilogy, some shots were amazing when some looked like Enthiran. Other than that writing, plot, fight choreography were useless.",0
40,"A HUGE slap in the face to Terminator and T2. T2 is my favorite movie of all time. Action, storytelling, characters, direction, pacing, special effects are all spot on. I watched T1 and T2 back to back to prepare for the so-called ""true sequel"" to T2. Here though, were treated to a continuation of T2 that makes absolutely no sense. It's like everything that happened in T2 never happened, or if it did it was just a waste. Killing John Connor in the first 5 minutes of the film... absolutely ridiculous. And the way the Terminator kills him is so casual too.The first 20 minutes or so is set in Mexico, so it being 2020 (or 2019 if you watched it in the theatre), it has to be politically correct or someone on Twitter will complain about it so we get everything subtitled for us dumb Americans instead of them just speaking English.There's so many other things I hate about this movie but I'll cover the worst of the worst: -Arnold is a learning machine yes, but they took it too far with him feeling ""bad"" about murdering John Connor so he helps a woman and her son and basically becomes his stepdad. -Its way too reliant on heavy CGI instead of a good story line. And much of the CGI looks kinda crappy especially for a movie with a $190 million budget. -Hispanic Terminator can run fast, jump high, dodge bullets, make multiple stabbing weapons, separate himself from his endoskeleton, infiltrate data lines and even create a gun out of nowhere. Sorry, but that's just WAY too much. Explosions, guns and fire don't kill him, but somehow the skinny enhanced human fem-dude obliterates him with her...power cell? And the human girl is the one that stabs him in the eye with it??? Cmon. -Arnold doesn't even show up until an hour is left of the movie. -Linda Hamilton has absolutely no chemistry with anyone in the film. From a character I rooted for in the first and second movies, here she's just a foul mouthed vulgar old b**** that I disliked most.I hate this movie. Since it bombed at the movies I was still hopeful it would be a decent Terminator film before watching it, but it's all just a huge waste of everyone's time. RIP Terminator.",0
41,Hamilton tries but her return was simply there to mask the fact that this movie is just another recycled plot utterly filled with action scenes that lose their lustre very early on. The cast is pretty bland and doesn't seem the least bit interested in what their characters are doing.Can we just kill the Terminator franchise already? Why must we keep rehashing garbage?,0
42,"Amazingly useless movie production – can't believe someone signed off this waste of resources which can be easily invested in far more creative products. Brilliant CGI, performances, photography – everything is there but a story.",0
43,John Connor dies in the first 5 minutes of the movie - Enough said. They Really should have stopped at T2. This movie officially killed the franchise.,0
44,Tan destruido la historia original y han puesto ahí a una colombiana que da continuidad a lo que queríamos ver. Definitivamente una decepción.,0
45,"OMG basically it gave up the idea to be a Terminator film in the first 2 min. Okey the Mexico set could work (becuase Connors were hiding here for a time) and there are some good action scenes thats worth 1 point but they ruined it because they went full PC/feminist,  never go full PC. Never liked causeless female rolechange. There are some cases where it works well Battlestar Galactica or Terminator:SCC for a closer example. The new terminator design recycled from Genisys. I could even live with the upgraded female protector idea. Even if she is a rip off Marcus Still the worst in the series. It wants to look like T1 and T2 but ends up a cheap copy of them.",0
46,"It's over, they've ran out of story to tell, and apparently don't have anybody with any imagination on the team. Good acting by Linda Hamilton and Arnold, decent visuals, but the story is pure garbage. Killing off John in the first couple of minutes of the movie was plain idiotic. John Connor is an integral part of the Terminator movies. And, finally, I like movies with a strong female lead. Movies like Wonder Woman.This was not one of them. THERE IS NO NEED TO REPLACE EVERY MALE IN EVERY MOVIE WITH A FEMALE. This is plain idiotic.",0
48,"A piece of **** created just to amuse the ego of the feminists, and make money on old fans.",0
49,"Yet another franchise runied. It's the best movie since Terminator 2 they said. Well the bar was not very high to begin with. Arnold, Linda and Mackenzie Davis did a ok job if you consider the awful story overall. Natalia Reyes character is poorly written and not believable at all. The new baaaaad terminator played by Gabriel Luna is just bland.This movie does nothing new, it recycles parts from the other Terminator movies and somehow makes it even worse. It have the stardard car chase, the standard helicopter chase and so on. Even if you take away the Terminator lore and see it as a separate action movie, it does not impress much.",0
50,"When the film tones it down and remembers the core messages and nightmarish situation we are faced with, it works. When Hamilton and Arnie are back together, it helps stir up relations and emotions from two decades ago as their characters clash and help tie up the films. It’s hard not to relish seeing them back together in different ways.The opening few minutes also present some near-perfect de-aging CGI (the new Hollywood fad) that is used well and really sends chills down your spine. It sets a tone, sadly lost during the course of the film, but reminds you of what has been before and the genius of how using music, slow-motion and effective editing can work to make a Terminator a true nightmare. It’s a real shame it’s over too quickly.Where does ‘Dark Fate’ leave the franchise? The future is not set. But with a franchise that has tried to re-invent itself nearly four times now but maintain it does have the core story at heart whilst doing it, it’s not a convincing future. The originality has gone, and repeated themes and action are getting stale and no powerhouse of acting or cast can cover up these issues and problems.",0
51,"I had high hopes for this movie. It looked like a return to form. But then, they hit you with that opening scene. It isn't even used to push the characters or the story forward and is just in there for shock value. The rest of the movie is bland and dull. It all felt so generic and manufactured, just like the terminators themselves. Don't watch this sorry excuse for a movie.",0
52,"Much like Disney's Star Wars and Ghostbusters 2016, this film is a complete slap in the face to the fans of the franchise, specially at the start of this movie. What makes this worse, is that it tries to create an illusion of being something original and new. Any terminator or film expert will know that like Ghostbusters, Disney's Star Wars will see that it's just another Terminator 2. Same story, different settings. Same villain, different name. Same dialogue, different writing. Same Hero, different gender and ethnicity. None of it is new, it's just lazy writing and insult to people's intelligence. Overall an enjoyable action movie with good acting but it fails as a new Terminator film. It is a much better film than Genesys but worse than T3 and Salvation.",0
53,"If you’re gonna reboot a franchise, don’t replace an important character with a generic female character that the audience doesn’t care for. It’s not even a good MOVIE outside of that terrible detail. Bad action, bad characters, recycled plot that is made 10x worse, and arguably the worst sequel released this year.",0
54,"I gave a 5 but I was not sure this movie deserved it, so I changed it to 0. Ok, Arnold is always the top and the human-like robot is a good idea. But Sarah's character tries too hard to be cool. The girl, i don't even remember her name. One meter and half of girl kicking asses like there is not tomorrow, wtf was that? If you kill J Connor, than you have to make a hell of a movie, not this feminist crap",0
55,"Thank you for s**t on my child memories James C!. T2 is my most and ever favorite movie and I was first exited to hear about new Cameron’s Terminator, I was expecting serious movie with logic continuation...But first 20min was like watching Indian parody with Mexican cast and chinese FSX...how they turn the story on John, Terminator and Sarah is just so ridiculous, this is just a shame!",0
56,"If you dont mind what it does to the legacy of the first 2 movies and you want some light and thoughtless action in a ""you go gurl"" coating. This movie might be for you. For the rest of the world, stay WAY clear of this garbage.",0
57,"To woke for me. The movie consist of wokness to the brim, making political statements all over the place. In their strive to excel at correctness they forgot to make a good movie. I’ll give it pointe for Arnold and Linda though. Everything else is sadly crap.",0
59,"One point for Arnie and Linda, who are desperately trying to hold the movie, but it's too weak to do so. Weak story, seems to be written quickly in order to provide a script. Weak acting, especially from the female duo, Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes. FX would be good in the previous decade. And last, but not least, did you REALLY had to kill John? Was it a feminist symbolism thing? The male savior figure dies and the flame goes to the female savior figure, or something like that? Stop rebooting and start writing original stories!!",0
60,Terrible.... everything! One of the worst terminator movie i’ve ever seen. Please Hollywood stop rapeing this franchise.,0
61,"I give it one point because the visuals are pretty good. The rest is terrible. Script is largely nonsense, the acting is painful and the extremely obvious hyper feminist try hard cliche is very tiresome. Another remake hack ruined first by the script and then by politics. Shame.",0
62,It's a insult for the Fans. Don't pay for it. Amazingly cringe fest. Hard to believe someone came up with ideas like this.,0
63,"This movie is a **** disgrace and a waste of your time.A god damn **** and a mexican **** going to save our future!? Have even creators of this dump believed this? Well, ofcourse no, they just hyped on the left agenda and tried to earn some coin.If you want to watch a good Terminator movie or try to feel the atmosphere of this dark future, just watch a 1 and a 2 part of the original dilogy, or play a Terminator: Resistance game, which has a much more in common with this universe, than this disgusting, animated slide show.",0
65,"I enjoyed this in the cinema. Would have rated it highly. Upon reflection however, the story seems a bit lame. I have no real interest in watching this again because from what I recall the story is essentially 'Men are no longer good, women are the action heroes now'. I'm a woman, I love wonder woman etc. this is not a case of anti women, it's a case of, I'm fed up of this feminist agenda leaking into everything. I would much rather watch Genisys or Salvation. The Rev 9 is a cool design and his acting is awesome. The action scene where Grace first fights him is really well done.",0
66,This is one big joke...Sad for Arnold and Linda they deserved betterSadly but Terminator rip,0
67,"WOMAN EMPOWERMENT, KILL MC FOR A FRANCHISE THAT HAS BEEN A THING SINCE 1984 BUT HEY FOCK HIM, HE MALE HE BAD.Seriously hollywood, my gf couldn't stand this and she is a major Terminator fan. I like it to a degree but its like you killed off her franchise just to sex change the resistance leader cause for some reason we need female empowerment 29/11 days of the year. Eat **** hollywood.",0
69,"Is this a joke? Is this some kind of a sarcasm? Parody on the trending rad-feminism?Previously, in USSR where I was born, directors at least knew how to make propaganda subtle and not so obviosly disgusting. Through watching Dark Fate  I had a feeling that the film itself is secondary, and the ultimate meaning of it is simply promotion of certain views, using Terminator franchise as decorations.",0
71,"Todavia no se como dieron luz verde a este monton de basura caliente. Linda, Arnold deberian sentir verguenza por participar. Tuvieron oportunidades de hacer una secuela digna, traer a Eddie Furlong junto a Linda cazando terminator, pero deciden matar su personaje por despertar femenino. El futuro de la franquicia esta en el limbo ahora, espero que puedan recuperarla con una serie de tv y que regresen a Furlong, del elenco original es el mas joven para llevar a cabo el lavado de cara.",0
72,Very predictable if you've seen the first Terminator movie. It is to Terminator property like Ghostbusters 2016 is to the Ghostbuster's property.,0
74,I was looking forward to Terminator: Dark Fate as it looked good and I heard Linda Hamilton was joining the project and was returning as Sarah Connor and reuniting with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I also heard it's a sequel to Terminator 2 or some crap like that but after watching it at cinema's I'd say a sequel to Terminator 2 now seems an insult. I hated Dark Fate because 1) The villain Terminator (rev 9) was unimpressive.   2) The film looked cheap.  3) The ending was laughable.  4) The action scenes were not that great and the film felt horrible... They even destroyed the franchise by killing off John Connor which has made the whole series make no sense... Terminator: Dark Fate is a dark mistake and a horrible movie that should never have been made. Terrible Terminator film!,0
75,Neither chinese millions nor the roided replica of Justin Bieber are able to salvage this soulless piece of **** advertised as a movie.,0
76,"This movie is absolute disappointment. At first, the villan here is so stupid and makes me think that he's specifically lends itself to the main antagonists. It has so much power and abilities, but he uses them only when it looks epic. For example, his ability to destroy flesh on contact once, when looked intimidatingly, but when Grace was contacting him with her body, he didn't even think about using this ability. He's so pathetic, stupid and miserable. He even can't hit his opponent with spikes, when he was aiming at point blank range. And in this movie, there are a lot of moments when he could just kill everyone, but he didn't because... Idk At second, women characters here are just such strong just because..they are strong. Sarah Connor for example, was a strong woman because of years of training, not because screenwriter wanted it. And there are a lot of such minuses. This is just a try to hit trends, using female characters. *АСУЖДАЮ*",0
77,"merecia infinito negativo, matar o John foi talvez a pior ideia que poderiam ter, de bônus o exterminador virou pai de família",0
78,"Terminator 1 and 2 were classics.  I have seen both of them a dozen times.Terminator 3 was garbage, but watchable.  Salvation... well, uh... Sam Worthington's acting was mediocre?  I demanded and got a refund from the theater for Genisys. I walked out after less than 30 minutes.  I've only walked out on two movies in the theater before this.  One was so bad I don't even remember its name, the other was.. Terminator Genisys.  After Dark Fate, I'm done.  This franchise is dead and should have ended at 2. Absolute trash, Cameron should be ashamed of himself.  Arnold should be (but can't, because he has none) ashamed.  Hamilton should be ashamed.  Mackenzie Davis is the sort of moron who probably thinks this is a good movie because it has hamfisted leftist politics shoved in the audience's faces in the most insufferable ways imaginable (according to a friend who sat through the entire thing it got even worse).

81,"Terminator: Dark Fate is a disappointing Terminator movie, especially since this is the real T3, the sequel to T2: Judgment Day.This film is what The Force Awakens is for the Star Wars franchise: a lazy derivative movie based on the first beloved films. Dark Fate is almost copying T2 to the letter. Highway chase with a truck, liquid metal Terminator, etc. Nothing new in this movie that we haven't seen already in previous Terminator films. This movie is creatively worse than any other Terminator movie. Even Salvation and Genisys had something new to show.But what's even worse, this movie is a SJW parody. Full of political correctness, pseudo-diversity, and feminist propaganda. It's like taking Tomb Raider or Charlie's Angels, writing the women out and replacing them with men. Ridiculous.First they write John Connor's character out and replace him with a female leader that can't inspire nothing. Then Arnie's T-800 is sidelined for the vast majority of the movie (can't believe the stupid backstory they gave to this T-800) in favor of a 6 feet high lady trying to convince the audience she's a badass, and her enhanced abilities are explained by cybernetic augmentations. Yeah, a Resistance hiding underground have the infrastructure to perform cyberpunk surgeries while being rampaged by robots sent by a Skynet that's not named Skynet but acts as Skynet. Yeah, Skynet's also out, but only in name. Now it's called Legion LMAOThe only really good thing in this movie is Linda Hamilton, who really came back as T2's Sarah Connor. Yeah, she's back. Unfortunately Arnie's T-800 doesn't speak this line for the first time ever and it made me cringe.",0

Who thought this was gonna be a good idea?Skynet got destroyed and THAT judgement day was aborted, but for some reason a new AI called ""legion"" takes over in the future and for some reason it also builds terminator that look like Arnie to kill John Connor... and they succeded, but that doesn't make any sense since in the new future Not-Skynet's nemesis is a girl called Danni. Yeah. That happened. They killed John Connor, which survival was a central point for the first two movies just like that.Arnie ks back as a terminator that tries to blend in human society, that was a good point, but falls short once you realize he is just the comic relief.The good terminator is grace and she has one of the dumbest weaknesses ever, having to resort to meds every now and then to keep her metabolism up or something.I'm not even sure if this terminator that came back and killed Johm was sent by Skynet, which shouldn't exist anymore according to the movie itself, since J-day was aborted, or if it was Legion, which also doesn't make sense, since it is Danni that will lead human kind to victory. Avoid it. It sucks like all the sequels after T2.",0

I can still remember arnold from t1 and robert patrick from t2 traumatizing me for years. Now I heard it's going to be woke and a feminist film, right then and there I was already expecting the worst for john connor and t800 arnold. And behold! The first 5 mins of the film they killed john connor which completely spits on the lore that the franchise built and made the whole protect john connor from t1/t2 pointless. We cheered for sarah when she destroyed the t800 in t1 and we cried with john when t800 sacrifices himself in t2, now all of those scenes are meaningless to make way for this stupid real life politics.

101,"Steaming pile of **** It gets a three from me solely for some pretty awesome action sequences. Writing is a dumpster fire; characters are shallow; plot holes galore. Essentially, this movie didn't need to be made. It feels like a pretentious, virtue signaling vanity project for Cameron. Creepy agre-regressed Edward Furlong's John Connor is murdered 2 minutes into the film, by a Terminator we never knew about, years after melting all of the cyberdyne evidence. So Judgment Day didn't happen and Skynet never came to be, but a T-800 shows up and Murders John. Ok. All of this makes no difference, however, as humanity has a new hope; a young Mexican girl named Dani. Why is she the hope? Who knows? She is because James Cameron has told you she is. Why does humanity need a savior if Skynet is never created? Because Skynet is created, but it's called Legion and creates terminators that look exactly like the old terminators, in a future that looks exactly like the other future. So essentially, everything that normally happens in a Terminator movie happens here, but the people and names have changed for reasons that are not entirely explained or explanable, for what appears to be political correctness. We're in exactly the same position as before, for unexplainable reasons, solely so Girl-John Connor can be introduced for no reason whatsoever; because it's the same movie regardless.So you see, this movie didn't need to happen. It is a bad version of T2, with a random female lead that exists solely so the movie can reset with a female lead.",0
102,Saw it tonight with some friends is trash. I wanted to like it but could not is so dumb. Natalia Reyes was horrible looked like a child with a gun badly cast. The terminator was blah there are a few cool moments but nope this is not our terminator.,0
104,"Spoiler Alert: Terminator: Dark Fate is the result of a director experiencing sophomoric inflation under the guidance of an originator who wishes to see director's under his influence/guidance fail as a means to establish his own supremacy.Dark Fate starts off with a scene that is not only telling of the humanistic decay of Hollywood, but that of our culture as a whole. John Connor, in his youth, is unceremoniously shot by a T-800 with a shotgun twice, once in the chest at midrange, and once in the head at close range, while talking to a girl in Honduras, with his mother, as she watches on.If that scene sounds horrific it's because it is. We have come so far from our own humanity that we are willing to sacrifice it one screen, meaninglessly, just to setup a plot.No thought to what came before.Was it possible to construct a meaningful Terminator ""3"" while honoring the plots of the previous two films? I would like to think so.The slaughter of John Connor not only betrays the character and the audience but introduces the fundamental error possible in any story about time-travel. It unravels the plausibility of the timey-whimey reality into a ball of meaningless noodles, which if thought about burst in, ""wait what's?""The further plot is no better and is an attempt to make, ""meaning,"" out of the initial betrayal to the audience.I wonder if slaughtering John was a way for James Cameron to vicariously and quasi-cathartically end his relationship with Linda Hamilton, whilst simultaneously flipping her off behind his back, roses in front of him. Please, join this next film, it's going to be great, oh and we are going to kill our metaphorical son right in front of you in the first scene, to your impotence.I can only imagine after Deadpool Tim Miller thought he could do no wrong, at the time the most successful R-rated film ever released. Failed sophomoric attempts are so common in the entertainment industry that Billy Corgan is quoted as saying the industry types, at least in music, don't expect talents to last for more than four years. Apparently the execs are going to give Tim Miller a second chance. Part of me doesn't want that to happen. Though, he is human. The rest of the film is an un-original new terminator which is literally just a combining of the previous two terminators, an ill formed attempt at being, ""woke,"" and some not so great banter.This was not passing the torch.In fact I have decided that personally, for me, many of the beloved franchises never really got the new sequels. Just because it is official cannon, according to some corporation, doesn't mean it will take up the same mythopoetic space within the culture as the predecessors. You can't insist your version of the tale is the one the culture and it's melange of unconscious fantasy is going to take on. No one will really remember this film, for the most part. No one is going to analyze and use as metaphor the Star Wars sequels, for the most part. Cash grabs have that effect. They may make some sort of uncomfortable splash initially, largely pushed by the lifeless machine behind them, but they have no real impact, the deeper currents of the body of water they land in somewhat unaffected.This recent pate of crappy sequels however says a lot more about our culture. Why are we incapable of generating anything of substance? I suggest we have forgotten the need for suffering. I am just riffing off of Camille Paglia.",0

109,"Lazy script + SJW Politics + Jump the shark scenes = terrible film.  Dark fate is a terrible story....really, there is no story.   It is poorly written and I am shocked James Cameron, who is known for his intricate interwoven story lines and realistic believable characters and action really bombed this movie when he allowed amateur writers to wreck his franchise.  This movie is episodic.  By that I mean it is just the same characters going from one scene to the next in miniature episodes without any over-arcing or interwoven story whatsoever beyond ""lets run to the next location"".    When each episode is done (lasting about 15 minutes), everything that happened in that episode is 100% forgotten and nothing is ever referenced again later on.   Many things in this movie are absurd and grounded in stupidity and poor script writing:.... US Air force major is just going to hand over top secret gear without so much as explaining it to us?  A truck falls 200 feet from a dam into ravenous waters with human passengers and no one is injured?   A plane at 20,000 feet bursts and no one blacks out over decompression?  SJW politics are amock, running foul in this film.  The first 30 minutes are in Spanish, I do not exaggerate, I thought I was watching a foreign film.   One 15 minute episode has our characters at a border detention facility where...surprise surprise...US customs are negatively portrayed complete with a reference to separating families.   Good grief.  Lack of originality:  In this terminator the BIG REVEAL (why she is so important) is so obvious- it was pretty much shouted at us multiple times long before it happened.  NO one with an IQ over 20 would have assumed she was going to give birth to someone after the repeated insults to our intelligence by announcing it loud and clear early on.  John Connor was someone who led the resistance....Guess what this girl does?  Oh yea....how original.  The girl in this movie literally goes from ""i've never touched a gun before"" shy and typical to expert marksman and full on military leader in 5 minutes.   So stupid.A scene where non cyborg humans are underwater and then pop up to the surface like they are made out of Styrofoam is ridiculously unrealistic.too many plot holes and lack of an interwoven story in between all the little ""episodes"" the characters take every 10 minutes...  make iDark Fate a bad movie patronizing to intelligenceBad writing.",0
110,"An utter disgrace to the ""franchise"". The casting is atrocious and the political correctness agenda being pushed was so blatant it made me want to vomit in my mouth a little bit. The new her-minator was the only good part of this movie. The new ""Joan"" Conner had the charisma of a wet rag and was so badly cast and un-believable in that role it was laughable. Arnold had his balls snipped and was a side show in his own movie. He was playing second fiddle to a 5ft hobbit and a boozed-up, bitter Sarah Conner - who was a shell of the iconic character from T1 and T2. The ""bad"" peewee1000 terminator was bland and about as threatening as an earth worm. The story is just a pathetic and far weaker version of T2 even with many of the same seen-it-all-before action scenes. And what they did to John Connor was disgraceful. They took a huge dump on T2 and ruined it's legacy in the name of nothing more than making way for ""new"" characters.  I need to watch T2 again just to get this crap stain of a movie out my mind! Please, for the love of humanity give it a miss.",0

On top of that the story is boring and the mixed in gender politics are more annoying than anything else.

The Sarah Connor character was destroyed in this film.  They swept Skynet and John Connor away at the very beginning of the film!  This is no longer a Terminator film.

To replace John Connor with a girl and SKYNET with another AI with another name that does exactly the same things, triggers the same Judgement Day and even uses the same NAMES for its creatures (""Terminators"", ""Hunter-Killers"").You killed John Connor for this? For not a bit of real change? Go to hell.Arnold ""the househusband"" is pathetic and illogical too, why on earth a killing machine that accomplished its mission should care about a family out of nowhere without the long human relationship shown in T2?For no reason at all.And he enjoys the company of a DOG!?

The CGI is overkill and just too much. 2. Character deaths that were unnecessary.. simply put from Tim Miller himself it was for shock value. 3. They tried to Star Wars force awakens this and ended up being the alien 3/ Pacific rimjob 2 of a movie.4. Everything looks fake. Set designs look fake, too much use of green screens, a netflix style filter over top of everything. It just looks like beauty mode when you take a selfie. It doesn’t look real! 5. T Juan thousand is an awful villian and cant be taken seriously.6. Regardless of it being rated R fake blood dosnt make a movie good. The original first 2 films were grounded in reality. Practical! 7. They took Terminator into a Fast & Furious over the top action for people with short attention spans. 8. Poor writing, poor script. T-800 loves drapes.9. They didn’t do anything new with the story, they just tried to copy T2 and force awakened it.10. Meant for turning your brain off and seeing **** explode. What made T1 and T2 so great is that it was intelligent! It was gritty! It was adult! The action was realistic! The Terminator was relentless! It cant be bargained with! It will not stop!

165,"Alright, Let me gets the pros out of the way.Pros:- It was great seeing Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger in a Terminator again.- The plot line with Arnie’s character was pretty interesting if it made a little more sense.  Now that the pros are out of the way...Cons: - Everyone keeps denying that this isn’t a PC friendly film, when it is. John Connor, the savior of the human race against Skynet and it’s Terminators, a character we were emotionally invested in with T2, is killed as a teenage boy to make a Hobbit Latina girl the next leader of the human resistance. Not only that but they downplay Sarah Connor’s role in the franchise, by shaming her because she is the mother of John Connor and that there is nothing special about her. All the trials she went through in T1 and T2, the death of her lover Kyle Reese, the trauma of one day knowing the world would end and almost killing an innocent man in his home with his family watching, training John to become the resistance leader who would save mankind, after all that she written to be nothing special. What a disservice to not only the characters, but the fans too.- The plot is re-hashed elements from every film in the franchise. It has the plot of T2 with the Energy cell explosion scene from T3, and Arnold sacrificing himself (again) to save the main characters. - The people are claiming this is the “true” sequel to T2, but that feels far from the true. It feels like a soft reboot, it feels like it’s trying to distance itself from a film it’s trying to connect itself to. It’s so contradicting. - The action is way too over the top and the cinematography of the action scenes are like watching a Transformers film is hard to see what is going on in the scene. The CGI is somewhat worse than the last film. - The Rev-9 just isn’t terrifying. I can’t really put my finger on why but he just isn’t intense or disturbing. It might be the CGI but I don’t know.Do yourself a favor don’t go see this film, Doctor Sleep and Joker are out and those are much better films.",0

185,Terminator Dark Fate is just a disgrace to the franchise that is already been dead.All the stupid feminism **** and bad cgi made me want to hurt myself and the decision to kill John Conner In the first 5 min of the movie made the second entry useless.Tim Miller and James Cameron should be ashamed of there selves.Im glad this movie bombed.1 star!!!!,0

189,"I made an account just to review this movie and express my disappointment. I'm a big Terminator fan, loved T1-2, kinda enjoyed T3-4 (let's forget about T5). This movie had great potential, and instead we were delivered with a plot that is a complete nonesense and a slap to the face to fans that have followed the series this whole time. Marketing-feminism/empowerment, robots with feelings, forgettable characters. KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE!  The only reason I gave it a 3, is because I enjoyed Linda Hamilton's performance (loved to see her again on screen) and the action sequences were pretty decent. But the plot is a disaster... really sad and disappointed.",0
190,Why does this pile of crap even exist? T2 is a damn near perfect movie. every sequel since then has been mediocre to trash. This series should have ended after T2 since all they do is make it worse. This with out a doubt is the worst Terminator movie in the franchise. While its Nice seeing Linda Hamilton again they pretty much Retcon every thing that is Terminator and make it stupid. I thought this one might be some what Decent since James Camron was attached to it and he has never made a bad film... until now. This was just cringey and just mind numbingly stupid. The action was pretty good and the only reason I'm giving it 2 points.,0

I wish it did do some things differently, but I enjoyed it overall.I am mixed about John Connor's early death. It's sad to see this character get killed and the replacement character is Dani, who I didn't care about too much. But on the other hand, this series did start with Sarah, and I thought it made sense to end it with her. Though John still could've lived as well, or at least until the end. Plus, Sarah was killed off in Terminator 3, so I'm glad she got to be the main protagonist again.Overall, I like this film. It has its shortcomings, but I enjoy it. 7.5/10.",1

Muy buenas participaciones de arnold y linda hamilton, pero pienso se deberia de cerrar un ciclo que ya esta por demas desgastar siempre el mismo trama. Pelicula llena de accion, nuevos villanos y escenarios de accion. Esta palomera, cumple con divertir al espectador. Un 8bes calificacion justa para lo que se ofrece. Recomendada sin duda, si no hay mas variedad para ver.",1

205,I've yet to see a Terminator film I didn't like. This was a very entertaining film.,1
206,"E-Value: 8Acting: 9Plot: 7Due to the critical failure and box office bomb of 2015's Terminator Genisys, the Terminator franchise rebooted once again with Terminator: Dark Fate, which is a direct sequel to 1991's Terminator 2: Judgment Day while 2003's Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and 2009's Terminator Salvation including Terminator Genisys have been deemed as non-canon.Three years after the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, something terrible has happened which would change the future forever. Fast forward to twenty-two years later, a new and advanced Terminator called Rev-9 (Luna) was sent back in time from the future to Mexico City to kill Daniella ""Dani"" Ramos (Reyes) while a cybernetically-enhanced soldier, Grace (Davis), was sent back to protect her.While Grace and Rev-9 are fighting in a highway, Sarah Connor shows up and temporarily disable Rev-9. The three of them regroup at a motel where Sarah learns from Grace that Skynet does not exist in her future and Rev-9 was sent by Legion, an A.I. similar to Skynet, to kill Dani, who is an important figure in her future. Sarah also received many encrypted messages prior to her involvement with the two of them which Grace trace its location to Laredo, Texas. Once they arrive, Sarah is shock to meet the person who sent her those messages is none other than the T-800 who has done something terrible to her in the past.Terminator: Dark Fate is really a good movie and it is better than Terminator Genisys. The movie has a very good action sequences and well executed. All of the cast gave their best performance. Gabriel Luna really nailed his performance as Rev-9 and I can see that he can really portray a villain character. Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger have done a great job too. Both of them haven't lost their touch with their respective iconic roles as Sarah Connor and the T-800. It was also great to see them reprising their roles. The movie would have lost its touch if it weren't for those two. The CGIs in this movie are really great and a huge improvement from the last three movies.While the movie is going into a different direction, I have also noticed that the plot of the movie is a copy-and-paste from the first two movie: A terminator is sent back to the past by an A.I. to kill an important figure while a human protector is sent back by the resistance to protect that figure. While it does introduced some new characters and things like Legion being the A.I. instead of Skynet but the way the filmmakers executed is basically a recycled plot points. I felt the plot could have done in a different way instead of using the pre-existing ones.I got to give credits to filmmakers for taking a one big risk on the opening scene. In my first sentence of the first paragraph, I mentioned something terrible has happened. It is really a huge spoiler which I suspected that some of you already know what it is but I won't spoil it here. The opening scene is kind of a controversial which is why I give credits to filmmakers for this daring risk.Because of this, some of you may debate that Terminator: Dark Fate is a better third movie than Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines or it could be the other way around. Personally, I love both of these movies even Terminator Salvation except Terminator Genisys. If you are a fan of Terminator franchise, you should not miss this instalment.",1
207,Quite ok Although it Feels repeatative when Terminator come back again and again! pacing has some issues But ending holds the emotions and make it more emotional for Arnold's TerminatorAlthough it's a great viewing!,1
212,"Хо-хо. Это было так плохо, что я прям не ожидал. Делать продолжение культовых фильмов только для того, чтоб испортить всё лучшее в них, и пытаться выехать за счёт показной ""прогрессивности"". Восхитительно. Хорошо, что я уже не могу относиться к сиквелам всерьёз.",0
213,"For those of us that want a great action movie, without all of the overly dramatic relationship scenes. This is the one this year.",1
214,"My only problem with Terminator 6 is that the first five minutes seem to negate the plot of the first two films (ironically of which it is a direct sequel). Overall decent action, acting and glad to have Linda Hamilton back, but its not groundbreaking by any stretch of the imagination.",1
215,"Wow.  If you love filmmaking which expands the History of Imagination in narrative literature, this is a movie for you.  Why so many lukewarm and cool reviews?  I think again we have the Alita Battle Angel pattern here:  Another very professional, 100% effort in sci-fi-fantasy, WHICH HAS A GOOD, NOT JUST COMPETENT SCRIPT which under-performs at the box office,The pattern I see?  Scripts and directing become too progressive for today's young male ticket buyers; and, fan many professional critics who are in their 20s-30s.To criticize Dark Fate's script as incompetent, I do not think holds up to scrutiny.  I've written 30 non-fiction books, scripts for 60 live events and one 3-hour film script.  So there's a fair chance I'm in a good position to evaluate if a filmed script is competent or not.  Like Alita, Dark Fate's script is competent and then some.  Perfect?  No.This leaves us with explaining why audiences and critics accuse these scripts of missing their mark.   I see a pattern emerging.  Alita, Dark Phoenix (X-men) and Dark Fate are perhaps all too female-centric, too much about connection and relationships, for young male ticket buyers and younger critics who are not authors.If this is true, this leaves us with the question why Wonder Woman (2017) which is is all these things--was successful.This is where we can point out neither Terminator nor Alita are conventional heroes, young Western males are likely to respond to.  Wonder Women is close enuf to male ticket buyers hero fantasies.  As well as, Batman has a supporting role. Other really excellent fantasy sci-fi movies which under-performed at the box office, which may fit this pattern:- The second Fantastic Beasts film (2018)- The BFG (Big Friendly Giant) (2016)- The Golden Compass (2007)- Narnia films?- Ponyo (also known as Ponyo on the Cliff) (2008) (almost unique portrayals of the Divine Feminine on film.  Look for it at your library)",1
216,"Whoa what a ride! this movie was great. I haven't watched any terminator movies since Judgement day. I know there was like five other terminator movies and i never really understood. This really seemed like i could be the end of the series. There's a lot of talk about plot holes but any amount of imagination will fix that. Example Why is terminator old? Because he is pretending to be old, therefore he is wearing different synthetic skin. The new Terminator just keeps on coming  and coming it's a never ending thrill ride with an overpowered future jerk putting the gang's back up against the wall literally from start to finish. The characters all had their own stories that intersect in just the right ways to make them come together as a team.  Wokeness? Get over yourself. You'll always have the originals. at least untill Jaden and Willow smith make the remake staring themselves. untill then just enjoy the ride. Skynet, Legion, watchtower, They are inevitable baybay!",1
217,"Jeg synes den var pisse god og lever op til alle forventninger, og hvis man samlinger de andre film T3, TSalvation, og TGenesys, så vil man også synes TDarkFate ligger dårligt, men jeg ser bort fra dem og samlinger KUN The Terminator og Terminator 2: Judgement Day, så vil man få en andet perspektiv i Terminator 3: Dark Fate.",1

220,"Terminator has been my favorite movie of all times.  It has even motivated my career with me obtaining a Masters in Information Systems.  Watching the 1st one as a kid, it really intrigued me in ways no other movie did.  While the 1st is my favorite, the 2nd still remains the best, I will definitely say that this one will be 3rd on the list.  This movie does bring back the Terminator tone unlike the other films.  The technology is well thought out and the action is clearly there.  However, I must say this.  Be warned this movie is scarred by political messages.  While the other messages I can live with, what's bothersome is that this movie does deliberately, and unapologetic-ally make it clear that men are not needed in it's near climax of the film.  While the audience is at first lead to believe that Dani is the mother of the new savior to be, Grace smashes that idea in another part of the film revealing that is not the case.  Nothing wrong with the idea of a female making a difference in the future, the way that is presented was pretty deliberate to harm males watching the film.  She clearly states to Dani ""You are the future, you don't need a man.""  The way that she said it made the small audience that showed up to watch the film cringe and even groan.  My wife even thought it went too far in this.  Let's get something straight, if this was a film created from the ground up, for feminist, I'm cool with it.  It's their film.  But I don't understand why do these activist go to great extreme to find films that men in the Generation X era found great and convert them into something that it was not in the beginning?  I still give it a 7 because Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Gabriel Luna did an outstanding job.  I loved the idea of Rev9 and the future he represents.  I don't think this movie is going to make it though and will bomb though.  My theater was very empty for an opening film and I saw this weekend seating chart is empty.  I think if the political stuff was out, more people would have been willing to see it. There being a sequel, it's very hard to say.  Having watched this film, you will know how the second movie will likely play out, and it even ends in a lesbian undertone, although the creators of this film have the freedom to expand on this or go the other way.  It definitely doesn't end in a way that makes you want to learn more about the technology, or give any special hints as to what Legion is, rather it's simply a Skynet replacement.  In my opinion, I feel like Hollywood has money to burn because had they taken this film seriously, they would have focused on the film solely to make it great.  The women of this film didn't have to come off anti-men.  They should have played their roles, and they would have been great, like Linda Hamilton has been made great in the past Terminators.  It does brings a bit of tears in my eye because I did wanted to see a 3 part trilogy and I don't believe it will happen.",0
221,Fun action film. Best Terminator movie since T2.  Please go see it. Great action scenes.,1
222,"Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are incredible in this and Hamilton doesn't skip a beat as Sarah Connor. Dark Fate represents a nice return to form for the franchise after Salvation and Genysis (I liked Rise of the Machines so STFU) and does really good at getting thr franchise back on track. Its fairly similar to T2 in terms of plot and story which some could see as lazy and I would have done some things differently but from what I saw I liked. The new cast of characters were really good, The legion Terminator was a really convincing baddie and the young girl or the new Sarah Connor did extremely well for a relatively new actress. From what I saw, I enjoyed Dark Fate and it's easily the best sequel since Rise of the Machines.",1
223,"Linda Hamilton  is totally killing it , all three  females star were amazing !!!",1
224,I throughly enjoyed this movie it's better than all other one's made afterT2 anyone who goes into this expecting T2 is an idiot the one thing that has to be pointed out again is the all female team of heroes which like every other movie that does this as of late is an instant flop as we are all fed up with Mary sue woman who never make a mistake,1
225,Absolutely amazing film!!! Great acting from Arnold Schwarzenegger  and Linda Hamilton!,1
226,Awesome throwback to the first two. Arnie and Linda are back in fine form yet the newcomers steal the show. I loved it,1
227,"Just finished #TerminatorDarkFate. My reaction: while it doesn’t react the heights of Terminator 1&2, it’s much better than T3, Salvation and Genysis. Very action-packed. Delivers on the R-rating. Arnold Schwarzenegger has still got it as the OG Terminator who now goes by Carl, in fact, he probably has the most saddest story arc in the movie . Natalia Reyes is not bad as the new hero Dani. Now, while I don’t wanna go into spoilers, I will say that while the leaks are true, the way they’re executed on screen, particularly the opening scene, is very sad. And, I will say that is in part due to the return of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, which is why this movie works, because of her. Please go see this movie and give it a chance because I liked it. I really did.My rating: 4/5. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️P.S. If you see Dark Fate in IMAX, you’ll see the trailer for Tom Cruise’s #TopGunMaverick in IMAX ratio form since it was shot with IMAX cameras and it looks amazing in IMAX.P.P.S. While Arnold doesn’t say his signature “I’ll Be Back” line, he does address in a humorous but sad way that I won’t spoil, so, be on the lookout for it.",1
229,"There are illegal immigrants and the heroes are three women and Arnold, one of them Mexican.  Seems like a lot of insecure red cap wearing men with TINY PENISES hated this movie. it's actually a 9 but have to counteract the 1s and 2s.",1
230,"I'm probably going to be the only one to be okay with the opening scene, since the fate of that character won't live up as well as in T2, and just go downhill from there.Ok, hear me out on this. This does follow the same route the franchise has followed ever since (someone protects somebody) and it does throw out every conceivable (or terrible) thing you can think of in a Terminator movie annoyingly, but besides that, what Terminator Dark Fate does to make sure it's not a hollow and soulless copy paste of *insert title here* manages to make this a rather unique entry in the franchise. How? By simply shredding out pages from the failed sequels and try to flesh these ideas in the best way possible, whether it's a buddy-cop type relation between Grace and Sarah, or a Villain who can double his body from an already built Terminator. The sweat and tears of the studio are to be seen and heard in here, as they (and the all star cast of names they paid as much as a Pixar movie's budget) tried to come up with the best possible product they could've done, good or bad.If anything, it's probably the best piece of feminism movement I've ever seen than whatever Disney's trying to force now, because the 3 leads in this rule so much. We get to see the return of Sarah Connor and, even after 35 Years, she still looks the same to me, if not for a few new tweaks here and there. Mackenzie Davis' character, Grace, is fine. She's just ""female enhanced Kyle Reese"" and that's it (still,cool idea to have the enhanced human thing at play,especially after Salvation ruined everything from the trailers apparently), especially because at the heart of all the mumbo jumbo, is Natalia Reyes, who has no right being as good as it is. Better ""I won't hide in a corner, I'll fight!"" Line delivery than Transformers 5 (another Paramount movie), and I can definitely see someone seeing her as a figure of inspiration. It sounds like I'm talking like I'm some kind of Executive with the big glasses on, but that's really what it is. A big Female Action extravaganza with Action Mumbo Jumbo that'll make you smile even in the darkest of times.Surprisingly, they also continue the emotional beats from T2 with Arnie's T-800, even if it's a different T-800. I guess someone will roll their eyes when they'll find out he's in it for a short amount of time, but it passed out to me flawlessly, even in a sad way. This one won't stop the Nostalgia Factor from letting it all out. Yes, even in a big-ass 3rd Act that is so over-the-top and noisy, I kinda felt fearful for the main cast of characters. Gabriel Luna's Rev-9 is, alongside Robert Patrick's T-1000, the most evil **** you'll ever witness in a Terminator movie. Basically they shredded the T-X concept from T3 and made it all the more creepy.If there's any flaws to point is that, again, it repeats a story structure we've all seen before, so that may tire some people...most people up (and it is,so no issues there), and the R-Rating is either misguided or overused. Not saying it should've been PG-13 ('cause we all know how that turned out), but I almost couldn't have stood a **** or **** every 3 seconds, or the fact that a bloody or gruesome kill wasn't done as great as the previous ones. And, as good as this is, it still feels as if the franchise wants to get self-terminated.Although if they're going to be this great (with a big cast of talents who give a damn about the movie instead of hiring the guy from Thor 2 and doing a mess), I hope they won't get terminated. We'll see at the Box Office... Paramount opened Pandora's Box, and it'll be up to them to see if these characters are really back, or they're just back to have another Judgement Day….with the Audience. Oh,and see it in IMAX,obviously.",1
231,"He's Back! Welcome To The Day After Judgement Day! Don't listen to what critics say, if you seen it, write your own opinion!Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in Action as Terminator again! Been waiting for this film since T2: Judgement Day! Praise to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes, Heard it disappointed at the Box Office but hey, on top of that I enjoyed it! I would recommend you guys seeing this film before its too late!",1
232,"Definitely not the first two Terminators, but this is the best third-installment of the franchise. Say what you want about the movie killing off John Connor at the beginning, but John has been the center of the franchise for the past 30 years. It's nice to see someone else take the spotlight, even if the same idea is recycled. I want people to know that while it's okay to not like a movie, you can at least go see it before you tear it to pieces. Onto the important part: what I thought of it all. Arnold gave his best performance since Judgement Day, with the idea that he learns to regret what he was programmed to do. Linda Hamilton was awesome and Davis, Reyes, and Luna all had a great impression on the franchise. The action was nice high-octane fun, given the villain was a formidable foe. The story, while not the best, and still has the formula from the previous films, it does the best to give new energy and twists that make it different. There feels like there is emotional weight for all the characters and it makes them more relatable. I would see it, before you hate on this film like The Last Jedi.",1
233,"A solid entry into the franchise that is well crafted, entertaining and with good action, decent plot and did acting and dialogue it's really only weighed down by unrealistic expectations of many viewers. There can  never be a reignition of that ""first time"" anyone saw Terminator in this day and age. For what it is, it's great.",1
234,"tbh i dont understand why u guys r hating so much. Arnie was hilarious and uplifted the movie, Linda Hamilton was great, and the two new female protagonists were pretty likeable, i though Mackenzie Davis was good. The start of the movie really **** sucks (you'll see why), but after that the action is great, the new terminator actually feels like a threat, and the chemistry is good. You guys should watch",1
235,"Really well done, the movie is perfect, definitely the third best in the series, I don't understand why people are so triggered seeing a female character on the screen. If the female is the lead, or a female isn't stereotypical, they get triggered and call the content names. Equality means equal representation, which women are finally getting.",1
236,"by far the best terminator sequel since t2.  the right wing bashing of it on political grounds makes no sense as its not political at all.  great script, all the actors are great, wonderful pacing.  destined for cult classic status",1
237,"I really liked the first two terminator films, and I didn't like the 3rd, 4th and 5th. This one is the first I really liked again - finally a good terminator movie. I enjoyed watching it a lot, and I hope they will make more terminator movies in this style.",1
238,"I was slightly skeptical, partly because of the not so good trailers, but the movie is definitely worth it. I watched it 3 times. Each time, TDF seemed better to me. Cameron and Hamilton contributed a lot. Maybe not great as Alita, but it is a wonderful film. Many times better than the previous three ""attempts"" after T2.psUnjustifiably low ratings (due to a misunderstanding of the depth of the plot and the technical part behind it, or what happens to John Connor) are childish. The movie is what it is, not what some fans imagined it should be.",1
239,"While it doesn’t measure up to the first two films, it’s still a solid action film worth seeing. It’s a return to form for the franchise.",1
240,"This is not a bad movie guys lol While people may not agree with the direction story went, that by no means makes this a unwatchable or terrible film. Granted some of the decisions made about characters were shocking and possibly disappointing but maybe a little change is what this franchise needed because the direction it was heading was honestly getting dull. Action sequences are not just good, they are absolutely stellar actually. Grace who is the augmented human fighting against the terminator was fantastic because you could feel how unnaturally powerful beings would fight and damage you would do. Acting was decent as well, i felt like it was  better than the last 2 movies hands down. And of course it will have minor plot holes, its the terminator franchise thats saying goodbye to the previous 2 movies. That doesn't make this a bad movie. Avengers had a lot of plot holes, but that doesn't make endgame a bad movie lol I don't know i feel like there is a rush to judgement on this movie. It doesn't deserve a 3.6 at all (at the time of my review) I hope you guys give it a chance.",1
241,"Watch this movie if you like suspense, action a good script and scenes with a lot of culture. Brings the franchise back to T2",1
242,Simply exellent ... action and story were top notch. Linda Hamilton was the star of it abd the new terminator was the most lethal and scary yet in the franchise.,1
243,Really enjoyed the movie great action and plot but ofcourse you have to have seen the other sequels to understand it.,1
244,"T2 is one of my favorite movies and I think this was a very good sequel to it. Ignores all the other Terminator movies/shows since T2 which is fine. Love seeing Linda and Arnold back on the screen together. Corny at times. Action packed. Story little weak at times, but it has the humor and action to make it entertaining. Ending leaves plenty of room for future movies. Would recommend.",1
245,"A decent sequel to T2. Linda Hamilton and Arnold are entertaining, and the new character played by Mackenzie Davis is bad ass.",1
246,"Much better than I was expecting!  Terminator has been disappointing since T2 but this feels like a decent contribution in many respects.  Linda Hamilton carries it and Mackenzie Davis does a good job too.  Don't get me wrong - it isn't a classic like T2, but worth watching.  Only real issue with it is the overuse of CG effects.  Common problem in a lot of films now, I guess because it's a lot cheaper than it used to be.  Not an excuse though for the gravity defying fight sequences that really aren't necessary.  Oh well. Not the first recent film to have this problem, so best try to ignore and enjoy the rest of the film.",1
247,"The continuity and timelines within the Terminator films have been all over the place for the last few sequels or so. However, this particular reset in the franchise might be the best one yet, if only barely. There's a couple returning familiar faces, with Linda Hamilton returning as Sarah Connor and of course Arnie himself returning once again. The best new character standout for me was Mackenzie Davis as a human/Terminator hybrid. The story takes a few surprising turns here and there, and while some of them work, some felt not as warranted or effective. The action sequences were pretty great for the most part, even if some were a little too over the top. Overall, I respected the decision to retcon everything that's happened in the past few Terminator sequels in favor of making this a more true and direct sequel to the first two Terminator films (the best ones), but I simply found this to be a fun and enjoyable sequel, and was nothing that blew my mind too much.",1
248,I liked it it was god yeah it was decent I would recommend carl Carl Carl Carl Carl Carl Carl Carl Carl,1
249,Excellent movie with strong female characters which my husband and I both loved. Awesome CG and the script is not a rehash of the other movies.,1
250,"Terminator Dark Fate its for me the proof that fans don't know what they want in a sequel. You can see as the movie goes that isn't gonna be T1 or T2 but thats ok, it doesn't have to because its trying to find a knew way to continue the franchise.The actions scenes are good but waaaay to long, despite the fact that it could use more practical effects to make the audience feel the weight of the fights. Really like all the characters with the new choosen one being a little too hyped, especially on the future scene.",1
251,"Came into the movie with lower than normal expectations. The CGI, sound mixing, pacing, and chemistry amongst the leading ladies more than made up for the simple plot. I recommend watching it in a theater.",1
252,"Pros:-Great Action.-Great performances, especially from Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger.-The characters themselves are all fairly well written and enjoyable.-Solid Score.-Good pacing.-Killing off John Connor was a pretty ballsy move, but one that I feel really helps drive home that this is a different future than the one he and his mother prevented in Terminator 2, and I honestly like that. Cons:-They don’t explain at all how the Rev-9 is able to split into two. It’s not a big deal overall, but it would have been nice if they explained it.-The film plays it fairly safe with the story, feeling fairly similar to the first 2 Terminators at a number of points. Final Verdict: This a movie where I feel the hate it is getting is 100% unjustified. Is it perfect? No. Is it as good at the first 2 Terminator films? No. But is it worse than 3, Salvation, or Genisys? Hell no! This is still a really good movie that I believe is well worth checking out if you are interested. Just don’t go into it expecting it to be quite as good as the first 2 movies.",1
253,"I enjoyed this Terminator movie. The acting was good, it was true to the Terminator storyline. I hope we see Sarah, Carl, Grace & Dani again.",1

256,"I remember seeing the original Terminatornin the theaters, and rank both T1 and T2 on my all time favorites list. (I think I am unusual in that I actually prefer the original slightly to T2.)  To me, this is the sequel I have always been waiting for.  I see a lot of people suggesting it is too derivative of the original files.  I actually felt that it found a perfect balance of homage to the original greats with new angles and perspectives.  It all fit naturally to me.  Also, I loved the performances.  Can't say enough about how wonderful Hamilton and Schwarzenegger were in their roles.  I walked out finally feeling satisfied to have see a sequel worthy of the first two movies.  I was sad to see the poor box office and the number of people hating on it. I honestly don't get it. I hope more people give it a chance and see how much fun they have.",1
257,"A solid entry into the terminator franchise. Dark Fate does not have much which you haven't seen before, but it chooses the right things to include from previous movies.",1
258,"Solid action flick with amazing CGI. The base premise - robots and human being sent back in time to change the future - makes it almost unavoidable that the Terminator movies become repetitive. Even despite that, this was a solidly entertaining flick. The newest Terminator was well done - as menacing and relentless as anything gone before. And the enhanced human protector a neat twist. Nice to see Linda Hamilton and of course Schwarzenegger both again.",1
259,I loved it. I thought they did a great job. I remember the original and must say this was a great sequel to the first 2. I have seen the rest and I even liked genesis. If you like the movies just watch it and stop reading so much in to it. Well done.,1
260,"I bummed myself with negative reviews, lowered my expectations and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Action movies today are no longer intimate development of cinematic experience. The action is grand, fast and in huge numbers. Arnold no longer is the focus of the movies, and it's fine here. It was entertaining, let's just leave it at that. I had a few complaints, but they boil down to 7/10. Money well spent.",1
261,"Muito bom ver linda hamilton e arnold atuando juntos em um novo filme do exterminador, gostei da ação do filme, o vilão achei ok, mais acho que não precisa matar um certo personagem",1
262,"The action takes off within the first five minutes and doesn't stop until the end. The story line was fair and acting was good although I found it interesting that every time Arnold made a joke, no one in the theater laughed.I didn't feel that I wasted my money but I do hope that they DO NOT make any more Terminator movies. As with other franchises (Halloween, Freddy movies, yes even Star Wars) movie makers should only be allowed to make a certain number (no more than 3 IMHO). Anymore than that, I would recommend that movie-goers boycott the movie as a statement to make movies with different content.If you got some time and extra money, I would go see it.",1
263,"Solid action movie and follow up. While it was hard to swallow what happened to certain legacy characters, I understood why certain things had to be done to illustrate the consequences of attempting to change the timeline. Having said that I also get how this movie might upset some fans, but as far as I'm concerned I liked the change of pace and how the stakes were raised from the get go. The new characters like Grace were very compelling and to my surprise still felt vulnerable like Sarah and John from T1/T2, while the design of the Rev-9 is a worthy successor to the T-800 and T-1000, and just as scary. Sarah is just OK while the concept of the T-800 blending into human society after completing its mission like a samurai without a master was well done. My gripes with the film would be how the new AI Legion is much too similar to Skynet, I felt that there should've been more differences between the two. Overall very fun movie with exciting new concepts, just don't go in expecting fun fan service.",1
264,Great action terminator. Yes the terminator kills a lot of people like in the other movies but I didn't go to watch it make peace and discuss philosophy. A great return to form.,1
265,"Good movie, not the best one but is solid enough to pass a good time. Now the issue is that they should have stopped after the first two...",1
266,A fantastic non stop emotional rollercoaster of a movie.Non stop action and Arnie and Linda are as badass as always.No Terminator movie will live up to the originals but this comes close !,1
267,"The action scenes are the best I've watched, the CGI and deaging of the actors because of the end of the second installment (28 years ago) is amazing. All effects in general are very good. Good direction. The performances seeems VERY GOOD. Still it seems saturated with the action, too much and lacks taste. The film also starts well and then falls into a hole and has a hard time getting out, SSSLOWWW and when Arnie comes, it gets up; i don't feel good tempo; slow by pieces and a lot of action on others, that is, I don't think it has a good editing. Is it bad? NOT AT ALL, but it didn't convince me. Worthy sequel to the first 2. Many will hate it for what they did with a certain character.",1
268,"A bit wishy-washy, with some incredible far-fetched action.  Lots of scenes seem copied from previous films. Maybe the best one since the 2nd one.  Arnold seems to be included only to sell tickets. Feels like it could very well be the final film and it should be.",1
269,"I cried, it had everything you need to close a cycle. Meets the right criteria in between the history, absolutely the awesomeness from the whole cast and direction. I just want to say, thank you for this",1
270,"I utterly enjoyed this movie it had good action and is taking the series on a new path. If female leads low key bothers you, then the movie isn't the issue here then..... I'm a die hard T2 fan since childhood loved but I can say this isn't taking T2s throne but later iterations can from what was setup bere.",1
271,"The first terminator movie in a while that I've not had to force myself to sit through! The story moves at a brisk pace, and the plot is solid if a little predictable. I'd recommend giving it a watch.",1
272,"Having gone into this movie expecting a ""woke"" narrative, my brother and I spent the first 20 minutes sighing, cringing and predicting the worst. Then I turned to him and said, ""No, let's try and enjoy the movie."" ... ... ... we loved it!Actually, watching Terminator 6 really highlights the damage Star Wars, Captain Marvel and movies like them have done to the movement of female heroes. We expect them all to be bad because franchises have been destroyed by ""wokeness""; writers and producers have time and again been unable to put their vane politics down to write a good story.Terminator 6 IS a good story, and its three leads are compelling, intriguing characters who have genuine conflict with each other. Their dialogue, while at times might be conceived as anti-male, is probably quite accurate to the way women would speak to each other given the circumstances. Furthermore, the Rev9, while perhaps not as menacing as the T1000 or T-X, still makes for an enjoyable villain. And I do like the way Sarah Conner is introduced into the story.There is a point in the middle that could have easily gone ""woke"" about Trump's wall or immigration. Instead, the movie uses a detention centre as an incredibly effective and tense setting for another throw down with the Rev9. I was proud of the director for not pushing anything (at least not in any way that I noticed) because I didn't want to hear it in my Terminator film!Truthfully, while it's not perfect, Terminator: Dark Fate is a good movie (not just a good Terminator movie) and is only woke if you walk in looking for it.",1
274,"This is hands down the best Terminator movie since T2, it has tonnes of story at the front end to make you care about what happens when stuff begins to blow up.I do feel that the omission of Edward furlong reprising his iconic role greatly skewed the story in a direction loyal fans of the first two Terminator movies felt was too big of a mistake to validate this movie as a viable follow up to T2. For what it is, I think it's very well made movie, it definitely copies the formula that the original movie and T2 had, especially on how the story continues to be told even when the sh#t hits the fan. I need to watch this movie again and give it a more unbiased (not less bias) viewing, because I do believe hype can affect how we perceive a movie, especially on the first viewing. The veteran actors are on top of their game and the ’new to the franchise’ younger actors, I feel are surprisingly excellent, especially for an action movie of this scope. Omitting Edward Furlong, that is just sacrilege.",1
275,After a series of duds the franchise has returned to what made it great in the original but was also smart enough to use the best of T2. This is now in my top 3 of the Terminator franchise,1
277,"The sad thing about Terminator: Dark Fate is that it reveals how many insecure little boys just can't handle the idea of female action heroes.T:DF is as much of an entertaining ride as any other action flick from the last 20 years.  It doesn't really add anything to the Terminator universe except to help us forget the pain inflicted by T3, T4, and T5.  Personally, I'm a little tired of the ""liquid metal"" Terminator thing and wish they would just make it go away.I was never bored by the film, but neither was I particularly excited.  I give it a 7, I guess, out of respect for Linda & Arnold and the work they did in T1 and T2.",1
278,after a pile a **** sequel finally a good one. Not as good as T2 o T1 but for sure the only one worth watching since T2.,1
279,"Since that I have seen the first two Terminator films and I found myself loving them and when I think of the other sequels like the third, fourth and the fifth. Before I ever got a chance to see them I was like ""They not gonna be as good as the first and the second."" and you know what? I am right. I got a perfect feeling they're not impeccable as the first two. And now that I heard of the 6th film they're going to be making, Terminator: Dark Fate, I know exactly that this is not going to be as good and impeccable as the first two even though that Tim Miller who directed Deadpool and James Cameron will be attached to it as the producer since he directed The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day a few years back. Fans of this got really excited to see this and it was announced that Linda Hamilton will be returning in her role of Sarah Connor and Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as a T-800 ""Terminator"", reuniting the actors after 28 years. This is actually a direct sequel to The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day ignoring three sequels that have nothing to do with the continuity that T2 has had for us back in the day. Before I get a chance to go see it at cinemas I just need to address something first. I've just seen The Graham Norton Show and I've seen Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton along with Debbie Harry and Nadiya Hussain and I actually enjoyed it. Now lets get to something that the fans including myself in general are going to be p***ed off already. It is a box office bomb and by thinking of that, people have already predicted that this is going to be a bomb like what are they're going to make of it and what I thought of it, I actually liked it. I know it's not as fantastic as the first two films which I already assume that the other sequels are not as brilliant and I did actually watched this right after Terminator Genisys which apparently for most fans think it's a complete arse wash but for Dark Fate it's not a bad film. I was surprised that I didn't see any kids in the cinema but this movie is made for adults. The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of those movies I can watch over and over again. In my eyes I can never get bored of them. I love Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner, she's always great in those. Now as it is, for me trying to do the other Terminator sequels, ""I'll be back.""",1
280,"Il s'agit du 6ème Terminator si je ne m'abuse et ça fonctionne encore...! cette machine de film ou plutôt de licence (un brin surexploitée peut-être.. quoique !) est décidément increvable et inoxydable... à moins que... ce ne soit tout de même le chant du cygne !Mais quel chant très tapageur à tout le moins, très bruyant, encore bien délirant (mais sans doute pas autant que le précédent qui avait battu des records en la matière... oui en matière de délire bien délirant en guise de scénario...) et indéniablement très spectaculaire !Ce 6ème film est... finalement comme un retour aux sources, car la formule de ""Terminator"" reste en définitive immuable, intrinsèquement liée à sa nature science-fictionnelle absurde, celle du serpent qui se mord la queue, du retour vers le passé du futur plus ou moins antérieur ! et dire qu'ils s'y sont mis à 4 (poour l'histoire !) et 3 pour le scénario ! alors qu'il s'agit, devinez quoi, d'une méchante machine qui revient du futur pour ""terminer""... une pauvre fille inconsciente du danger et de son destin... sauveuse de l'humanité à l'insu de son plein gré etc, etc...Pour l'occasion en tout cas, Mamie Connor est venue reprendre du service... eh oui, Sarah Connor est une mamie maintenant, qu'on se le dise ! et une bien jolie Mamie ma foi, pas siliconée, pas collagènée, ni botoxée, charcutée ou je ne sais quoi ! et bien entendu, Papy Terminator, je veux dire Pépé Schwarzynator est également de la fête.Et curieusement, l'impact et l'intérêt de cette ""saga"" tient autant à ses personnages incarnés par ses comédiens (maintenant d'un autre âge) qu'à son délire SF à la godille. On a ainsi une bonne dose de fan service tout-à-fait plaisante et souvent drolatique. La nouvelle venue Mackenzie Davis est excellente dans son rôle de protectrice et une sorte de variante plus athlétique de Summer Glau de la fort sympathique série terminatoresque qui remonte à... pas mal de temps, déjà !Quoi qu'il en soit, on en prend plien les mirettes et ce Terminator reste fidèle à la série : un régal d'effets spéciaux et d'explosions, de cascades improbables, tout aussi improbables que le scénario lui-même ! et on ne s'en lasse pas.La réalisation reste de bonne facture malgré quelques hésitations ici et là ou plutôt quelques maladresses de cadrage et/ou montage (attention au cut & zoom ou move, on ne veut pas de ces merdes du cinéma moderne ici !) mais ça reste rare heureusement.Bon, évidemment , difficile de rester objectif, car à part le Terminator 4, j'adore tous les Terminator de la saga et celui-ci (le dernier sans doute avant un hypothétique ""reboot"" comme c'est la mode...) est mon préféré avec les numéro 2 et 3. Un savant mélange donc, d'action, de drôlerie, de délire et de très grand spectacle savamment dosé !",1
281,"WOW le meilleur film d'action de l'année ! Terminator n'a rarement était aussi bien travaillé que celui-ci. J'en attendais que des combats de robot contre robot.. Enfin nous les avons avec un scénario qui supprime l'épisode 3,4,5,6 et surtout qui redynamise une franchise qui avait besoin de la perception machine humain. Ramener la question existentielle.. ""On ne peut pas faire sans les machines"" (économique). ""On ne peut pas faire sans les humains"" (Émotion). Le film est impressionnant l'histoire positionne la femme en sont centre et rien ne déplaît ! Le méchant est vorace. Les gentils sont à la foi puissant est faible. Les coups donner et rendu sont exceptionnel. La destruction est magique. Une fin très bien choisie. Tim Miller rembauche pour le suivant !",1

286,"The movie was a lot better than I thought it was going to be but the story was pretty weak. The visual effects were phenomenal and awesome especially the Rev-9 Terminator. The acting was excellent especically from Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Mackenzie Davis. The hair and makeup were fantastic especially on Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Overall this was a great and entertaining movie.",1
288,"I see how many zeros are given by a fake users with only one review just for the sake of lowering the movie's score, so I'll be different and write something what I really think about the movie.First of all this movie is made for a single viewers category which I believe i belong to: those who actually have seen Terminator 1 and 2 as a kid. And for everybody older than that. Because kids and those in their twenties just won't understand the magic of VHS era. And what it means to have something from that era be finally treated with respect, which Tim Miller and James Cameron did. Star wars fans from the same age category I feel you, you didn't even get that.Secondly, behind the thin veil of typical blockbuster I've noticed something that makes this movie entirely different from its kind. It's not a blockbuster, but a farawell movie. Which I believe won't get another sequel for the first time in decades. At least I hope that Cameron won't do that. Please, Mr Cameron shoot a whole bunch of Avatar movies and don't touch the Termonator again. Let it rest.Thirdly, it still a movie that is a couple of parellel universes better than every other movie between it and Judgement day. Technically it has really good action, the return to the chase formula was the best idea. Plot-wise is also good, it has a good balance of dialogues, exposition and character interactions. Finally, after all that technobabble meant to explain all the timetravel, this movie doesn't explain ANYTHING. We don't even know why Carl knows so much! And this is good.All in all Dark fates is a proper way to find a good ending for a franchise that didn't need to have any sequels after Judgement day.I'll give this movie an 8 because it's a good movie.",1

Good action scenes, plot coherent enough to suspend disbelief and an interesting dose of dry, sarcastic humour. Terminator movies will never satisfy because people want it to be exactly like the old movies but at the same time go new directions, but I think this one reached a reasonable balance.",1

293,action scenes aren't good enough like other T movies and story just destroy T1and T2 story in seconds,1
294,"Terminator dark fate is being hailed by some as a return to form for the franchise, and by others another dull, cash grab sequel, but for me it’s neither. After the massive failure of a film that was genesis, I was half expecting this to absolutely suck and half expecting it to be amazing, and when I actually went out to watch it i wasn’t disappointed. Sure it’s not nearly as great as the original 2 films but dark fate is a thrilling and immensely enjoyable action flick and is still worth the watch. The movie introduces two important new characters; Dani and Grace, and although they are both perfectly acted I found it kind of hard to connect with them. I suppose grace was easier to root for because we were given flashbacks/forwards to her future which gave us some backstory, but overall I felt they struggled to feel unique unlike characters like Kyle Reece. Linda Hamilton makes a return as the much loved Sarah Connor, but having been out of the game for so long falls flat and forces the majority of her lines. Arnie is also back, but this time manages to keep his head above water with a performance that, for Arnie, is above standard. There are some interesting concepts in this film, such as Arnie being a remnant of a future that never happened, and the future that did happen being far worse. Unfortunately the new threat ‘legion’ feels contrived, as does the movies villain who just feels like a one up from the one from T2. He suffers from the darth maul effect, after already having a red, blue and green lightsaber they make a double edged one, and then one with a lightsaber hand guard (Kylo ren) so one so fourth. The biggest highlight of this film, doesn’t come From the acting or the story but rather the beautifully choreographed action sequences and top notch CGI. The movie is visually stunning and never has any problems with bad special effects. This one quality, is the one thing that really stops this entry to an overdone franchise from living in the shadow of its predecessors. Dark fate although at times feeling like a bit of a cash grab, is an immensely enjoyable action film with impressive effects and memorable acting and therefore it gets a 7/10 from me.",1
295,"Love this sequel, you guys should watch this movie, pure fun and pure action, should at least try watch this movie",1
296,"Tbh, I wondered about the user **** I found the flick ok. Was it perhaps because I did not expect so much?I found the characters very good. Grace is really badass and plays her role pleasantly authentic, without much cringe. Arnie and Linda also surprised me. Arnies deadpan humor is adorable. Both were set in scene in an appropriate way. I guess producers could have made many things worse. I also found it cool to locate the first half of the story in Mexico - the chase thru mexico, featured like a roadmovie. I liked that.I guess the story (in principles of the whole franchise) is the only real downside. The overall topic is always the same, somebody arrives from the future to prevent the judgment day (in the broadest sense). Now producers have to carefully make up their minds on how to proceed with the franchise.Bottom line: The topic of the Terminator franchise (incl Dark Fate) unfortunately comes without intriguing elements. It is solely due to the theatrical performance and the well-drawn characters that I can still recommend the film!",1

298,"Let's preface my review with some context:  My first glimpse of the Terminator universe was Arnold Swarzenegger on David Letterman on Jun 7, 1991.  I was five years old, laying on the livingroom floor playing with a toy firetruck.Weird foreign dude, blah blah blah, cut to the trailer, which was the bike bar scene with the cigar.  It blew my mind.  I wasn't sure what was going on, but it was badass.Never saw the movie until many years later, I think.  I knew what it was, I knew it was a big deal, but never saw it in its entirety, for sure, when I was in high school.  It is an amazing film - without a doubt one of the biggest and most impactful films of its time, and of all time.I grew up on Rambo and Die Hard.  Die Hard is my favorite film.  It's just well done, and was from the end of the pre-cgi era of film making.Cut to the point, before this movie, there were only two true terminator films.  The original, and T2.  I've tried to watch 3, 4, whatever and never got through an entire one.  I saw Genisys in the theater and was so frustrated.  Jai Courtney is franchise poision - he killed Die Hard as well.  Genisys is not a Terminator movie.When I had heard about Dark Fate, I knew that it was about to change, and they were going to right the various wrongs that had happened to the Terminator franchise over the years.  With Linda Hamilton back, it was guaranteed to be good.That being said, the movie wasn't spectacular.  There were holes in the plot, the new rev 8 Terminator guy was kind of DOA character-wise, although after reading about him and his involvement in the production, I have respect for him.  You just can't outdo Robert Patrick - that was a performance for the ages.  Mackenzie Davis was great, but I am an existing fan of her other work like HCF.  Linda Hamilton goes without saying, was great, although she set the bar quite high with T2...All in all, yes, it could have been a better movie.  I do consider it the first legitimate Terminator product after T2, and I accept the plot and the trajectory it puts the characters on.  I will be buying this on Bluray or something when the director's cut comes out, and I would not hesitate to go see a follow-up movie.  Wasn't planning that for Genisys, and I rejoiced when it was cancelled.If only James Cameron had done this instead of Avatar, 15 years ago...",1

There truly isn’t much you could do as a writer for this series, the timeline is so fleshed out and it doesn’t give a lot of wiggle room. That being said it was groundbreaking, but it was very good.",1
306,"I honestly don't get all the hate. People say there is nothing but SJW feels all during the movie, but that isn't the case. Sure there is a splash of it here and there, and making Grace overpowered may feel like a Mary Sue move, but her character is actually well done. Only real problem with her is how she comes off with some lines. She's overconfident in doing menial tasks, but when it comes down to fighting she's actually pretty bad ass.Dani is the main focus, and while her whole acceptance of what is going on and her changing into what she needs to become feels rushed, watch the movie and you will see all of her motivation for doing so. Not the best protagonist, but not bad. Linda Hamilton is mainly the reason to see this movie. Sarah is still as bad ass as ever, and she has all of the experience behind it so she can be blunt and in your face. Arnold does yet another great job with the T-800. They don't cram in funny dialog or moments to make people laugh. He is still the cold blooded, tactical death machine that we all know. Plus given the fact that he has his neural net processor, you see some interesting twists in his arc as well. The new badguy Terminator, the REV-9 is probably one of my favorites. Take everything you can from the T-800 and the T-1000, blend them together, and make him calculating and menacing.All in all, this was a great one to watch. It has Cameron's fingerprint all over the feel of the movie and its a fitting end to the story arc from The Terminator and T2. Say what you will about 3, Salvation and Genisys. Those were ultimately forgettable rehashed stories and **** we had seen before. This feels like the actual continuation of the whole franchise. Ignore all of the BS people are saying and give it a watch. It's not nearly as bad as people say. T1 was a 9, T2 a 10 for obvious reasons, and this one gets an 8 in my book. Great action, brisk pacing, and well written characters that fit the roles.",1

310,"To begin with T2 is undoubtedly the best Terminator movie followed by T1. T3 was something we all wish never happened and Salvation and Genisys were pretty good because of the twist they had. Dark Fate has been getting so much hate because they killed John Connor, the acting was allegedly bad etc. First of all, the acting was great throughout the movie (with a few exceptions). The killing of John is something I didn't expect but it gives a new meaning and perhaps future to the franchise. I can see why many fans did not like it, but to me it was fine. The CGI was great with minor flaws (especially the jumping parts of the terminator). The action did not disappoint either. To me this should have been T3 and I sincerely hope there will be a next terminator, perhaps with more parts showing the -current- future.",1
311,From my point of view this movie is underrated. It is not very original but entertaining like T2.,1

319,"Thank God I decided to watch spoiler reviews of this stupid movie instead of watching the movie in the cinema. I am so glad this atrocity bombed at the box office. I honestly had a bad feeling that John Connor was going to be killed off in the very beginning of Dark Fate according to the leaked rumors before the movie came out, and those rumors actually turned out to be true! Third wave feminism is ruining Hollywood and unnecessarily killing off great, iconic, beloved, straight white male characters (i.e. Luke Skywalker, Iron Man/Tony Stark, John Connor) from our childhoods only to have them stupidly replaced by lame, poorly written female characters (i.e. Rey, Ironheart, Dani Ramos) just to please SJWs! James Cameron is a liar and a **** for saying he was bringing Edward Furlong back as John Connor but ended up just using a young CGI stunt motion actor as teenage John Connor only to have him killed off in the opening scene of this abominable sequel and be sidelined by two random, dull female characters (Dani Ramos and Grace) annoyingly teaming up with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) all for a stupid woke, feminist, politically correct agenda. I was so stoked to hear him coming back as John Connor only to find out it was a big, fat, cruel lie and watched the atrocious Dark Fate opening scene on YouTube. Edward Furlong should have reprised his role as John Connor but obviously as an adult in Terminator: Dark Fate. Edward Furlong’s John Connor should’ve been a badass adult that uses weapons and is this brave badass, great, cunning, epic, heroic military leader of the worldwide human resistance leading the war against the human-killing machines that the previous canon Terminator films (The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day) greatly and heavily built him up to be and teaming up with his badass mom Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and one of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-101s saving humanity by destroying plenty of man-killing Terminators together like one badass trio in Terminator: Dark Fate. THAT’S WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN DARK FATE!!! THAT WOULD HAVE MADE AND BEEN A PERFECT AND LEGITIMATELY SOLID REBOOTED TERMINATOR THREEQUEL!!! The opening scene of Dark Fate is a huge slap on the face and one giant middle finger to all OG Terminator fans! That atrocious scene made T1 and T2 pointless, made Kyle Reese’s sacrifice in T1 meaningless, made the T-101’s mission completion and sacrifice in T2 meaningless, completely ruins the perfect ending of Judgment Day, and completely ruins everything we love about the first two Terminator films. Dark Fate ruined the two beloved, fantastic, timeless classics known as The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Genisys killed the franchise and Dark Fate buried the franchise. Terminator: Dark Fate is a franchise-burying disaster. I can’t believe he was killed off only to have him be replaced by some lame, stupid, short, skinny, random teenage Latina Mexican to please stupid SJWs. Stupidly and disrespectfully killing John Connor off like that in the first five or ten minutes of this rebooted direct sequel was shockingly all James Cameron’s (the creator of the Terminator franchise and the producer, director, and one of the writers of the two fantastic, timeless, beloved cinematic masterpieces The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day which he so fantastically directed, produced, and brilliantly co-wrote, and executive producer of Terminator: Dark Fate) decision. James Cameron is a washed-up, senile old coot and only a shadow of his former self. He is now a grumpy, old geezer who only wants to direct stupid, unnecessary Avatar sequels most people never asked for. Avatar was extremely overrated and boring. Avatar was so boring that I fell asleep through it. He is no longer a visionary, he is just a big idiot and a major screwup. He is now a master of art in ruining things. James Cameron is George Lucas 2.0. Tim Miller (director of Terminator: Dark Fate) is the new Rian Johnson. As much as I love the film Deadpool (which he greatly directed), he was a bad choice to direct Terminator: Dark Fate. He badly directed Dark Fate. He is a wrong director for Terminator movies along with Jonathan Mostow, McG, and Alan Taylor whom all each badly directed a Terminator film. The entire Terminator saga truly forever ended at T2. Everything after Terminator 2: Judgment Day is not canon and only fanfiction. When Terminator: Woke Fate comes out on Blu-Ray and DVD, everyone needs to incinerate every single copy of that garbage!",0
