0,"To sum this movie it up, it is a black comedy, a thriller, a horror and a social satire in 2 hours. Seems like a lot in 2 hours, but not only is the message of class division clear, Bong presents it in the most accessible and humorous way while being able to shock his viewer; and everything from the performance of the cast, to the script, to the cinematography and to the production is flawless and jaw dropping.Calling it a great movie is an understatement. Bong has created a masterpiece and what could possibly his best film so far. Go watch the movie as soon as possible. If you love cinema, this is one movie you have to watch. It will leave you speechless at the end.",1
1,"Absolutely magnificent movie from a great great filmmaker that always send the audience to a place that could just say: ""WoW, whatafuq...!""",1
2,"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it’s not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film’s message is a little on the nose but I don’t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film’s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film’s story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It’s so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it’s always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I’m using the word tension a lot but that’s what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose.",1
3,"I wasn't sure what I would find with Parasite beyond the expectations I had for the excellent reviews it has received so far.But if I should emphasize something about it is its unpredictability in a story that thematically emanates an amazing dramatic darkness and at the same time manages to balance it with a touch of black comedy and certain elements of a mystery thriller.Parasite is a film completely controlled and designed to be unraveled delicately while you consume its social commentary and understand both sides of the social spectrums of both families and the ending leaves a bitter lesson and yet nothing lacking reality.You will talk about it quite a bit after finishing itParasite is the kind of cinema that is always welcome and always necessary.Disturbing, dramatic, funny and unpredictable: A triumph.",1
4,"In “Parasite,” Writer/Director Bong Joon Ho continues his critique of capitalist economies that, in his judgment, inevitably create economic divides resulting in class warfare.  In his earlier films “Okja” (2017) and “Snowpiercer” (2013), Bong used a platform of science fiction to soften the message.  With “Parasite,” he employs slapstick and dark humor to leaven a story that, in lesser hands, might have become painfully didactic.Setting his story in Seoul, Bong has the benefit of dealing with class warfare and economic inequality without the complication of race.  South Korea is one of the most ethnically homogeneous countries in the world – 96% of the population is Korean.Bong’s pacing of his story is impeccable.  In Act One, we are introduced to the Kim family, literally and figuratively living in the lower reaches of the city, the parents unemployed and struggling, the kids getting by on street smarts.  When workers come by spraying white clouds of pesticide in their rodent-infested section of the city, the father advises to leave the windows open:  “It’s free extermination.”  At the other end of the economic spectrum is the Park family, wealthy beyond reason and totally reliant on others to do anything requiring physical or mental heavy lifting.  Bong underlines his premise by conveying clearly that, while they have great wealth, the Parks are not endowed with a particularly high level of intelligence, common sense or self-awareness.When a wealthy friend of the Kim son creates an opportunity for him to tutor the Park daughter, the Kims use this entry point as leverage, creating jobs for every member of the family within the Park household.  So far, the story, is light, bright and slapstick, with only a small vein of dark humor.  This tone offers opportunities for non-threatening exposition.  Remarking on the Parks’ unlined faces, Mr. Kim intones: “Money is like an iron.  It smooths the creases out.”In Act Two, the story takes a darker turn, initially by exploring the consequences of the Kims’ actions on one of the displaced workers.  By the end of the film, class warfare has escalated from bland observations (Mr. Park observes that those who ride on the subway have a “special smell”) to full-on emotional and physical violence.  For me, Bong’s thoughtful, subtly-crafted story invoked a fair amount of thought and introspection.“Parasite” won the top prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival and is South Korea’s entry for Best International Feature Film at the Oscars.  It’s one of the finest films of the year.",1
5,Such a good movie. Probably one of the best films ever created. Takes you on a roller coaster of emotions,1
6,"This is a Korean film that I can't quite categorize! I don't know whether to consider it a comedy, drama, thriller, dark comedy, etc., as it contains so many elements of all these genres. One thing I do know is certain though, this is such an interesting and unbelievable film in virtually every way possible! Winner of the Palme d'Or (the French equivalent of an Academy Award) earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival, this film follows a poor Korean family that attempts to insert themselves into the lives of a rich, upper-class suburban family by getting themselves hired for various jobs for the family, such as a math tudor, chauffeur, cook, etc. They seem intent on even replacing the family and claiming the house for themselves if possible, until they stumble upon something shocking and unexpected within the house. And to say too much else beyond that would ruin the amazing experience of viewing this film for the first time! Really, all I can say is this: No other film this year had me laughing so much during one moment, and then completely on the edge of my seat during another, with certain scenes even leaving me absolutely breathless and speechless! The acting, writing, and dialogue were all so brilliant and razor-sharp as well! The film is layered with so many unexpected twists and turns! I never knew where this film was going or what it'd morph or evolve into next, as each scene and moment always felt so radically different and unpredictable than the last! On top of all that, the film undeniably provides a unique subtext on class, social status, the lengths some will go to for prosperity, and how people within certain classes are often perceived. Overall, I can't even begin to heap enough praise towards this masterpiece of a film! It had just about everything to offer, combined so many favorite elements and genres of mine, and left me flabbergasted by the end to the point where I sat through the entire credits and then some in order to properly process and sit with what I'd just watched! This is far and out one of the best films of the year, maybe even the decade!",1
7,It’s never less than interesting and watchable but in the end for me there are so many better Korean movies that it doesn’t live up to the hype of my expectations.,1
8,"Parasite is satirical, but it's not meant to make you laugh hysterically. It's more sophisticated than that. It takes some unexpected turns that kept it interesting throughout. There is a turning point in the film when everything clearly starts heading towards a chaotic finish, and it delivered well.",1
9,"I think my life is like that, it was a very deep and content film, thank you.",1
10,"Well...This film is almost a masterpiece, for its genre. Visually stunning, brilliant acting, amazing direction by Bong Joon Ho, and a captivating story drive this film to incredible heights. I’m never too keen on foreign-language films as I can’t really understand them even with the captions, but this just glorified them. The only thing I’d say about this film that doesn’t really drive the movie down for me is the pacing was a tad slow, but that would be me nitpicking for any mistakes. Overall, one of 2019’s best for sure.",1
11,"Here it is.My favorite movie from Asian cinema this year.Good Acting,good script and a good directing... Thank you Bong Joon-ho",1
12,"A totally unexpected movie, left me disturbed. It's so good that it feels kind of unreal to be created in 2019. Masterpiece & best one of the year.",1
13,"I usually don't watch movies, my attention span is simply just too short for so many of them. Its for that sole reason I stick mainly to just thrillers and suspense, productions that will keep me at the edge of my seat. And oh boy Parasite does not disappoint in that aspect in any way whatsoever. Its a movie full of twists, one wont know what hit 'em..",1
14,"This movie was amazing!!! This is the latest movie from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, director of The Host, Okja, Snowpiercer and more. This is only the second movie of his that I have seen and it really makes me want to watch more! This movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. The performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! My only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. This is good writing, and I feel like I missed some of it. I’m a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. And yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled. If that’s an issue for you, don’t see it. You won’t enjoy it. Otherwise, if you want an exciting and well-made movie that is completely original, go see this movie! It’s one of the best of the year!",1
15,"Definitely worth watching and for my opinion the best foreign film of the year,",1
16,"This movie has a little something for everyone; comedy, drama, thriller. A full palette of emotions, masterful cinematography and an immersive and believable story. I'd recommend this to anyone who is willing to anyone who is willing to watch a movie with subtitles. One of the best films I've seen all year.",1
17,"You know a movie's good when you wind up having a dream about it. The last movie that affected me that way was Akira Kurosawa's Ran. The latest to affect me that way is Bong Joon Ho's Parasite. The only other movie I've seen from Bong is Snowpiercer, a film that dealt with the issues of class inequality, in Parasite he returns to this theme, but this time he plays it from a very realistic angle. Bong captures the tension of class disparity superbly, blending grittiness, humour and horror, and striking imagery that completely immerses you in the world he created. The actors all do a superb job, especially Kang Ho-Song, who best exemplifies through his performance, what it feels like to be on the less-fortunate end of the class spectrum. The writing is superb too, in particular how it portrays the struggle to move up the class ladder, using both the optimistic practicality of ""planning"" and pessimistic impracticality of ""dreaming"", in a hard-hitting way. This movie forces you to ride the wave with our main characters, all the way up, and down.The cinematography is beautiful, and the images composed superbly. The way the cinematography captures the architecture of our more-fortunate characters home is breathtaking, so is their lifestyle. No wonder our main characters plot and dream of being in that position, who wouldn't want to be?. The score stands out too. At times it gets super eerie and spacy and combined with the imagery, it helps produce the feeling that you are in a fever dream, and trust me, when the sh*t hits the fan in this, it's a fever dream and then some. I highly recommend this hard-hitting bit of cinema.",1
18,I rarely log in to write a review.This move made me instantly log in to post one.,1
19,"A great film that deserved to win the Palme D’Or at Cannes. In a strange way, it’s a Korean version of Upstairs, Downstairs, but much more cutthroat and much more fun. You never quite know what will happen next with such wily servants and such clueless and pampered rich people.",1
20,"Um dos melhores filmes desse século até o momento, sem dúvidas! Apenas assistam e procurem saber o menos possível para terem uma experiência surreal de vida.",1
21,"Dissecting the struggle between the classes through the lens of innate human nature -- regardless of class status -- provides the foundation for this rip-roaring black comedy/social satire, one of those rare films that grabs your attention and holds it from start to finish without letting go. Building on themes explored in such previous works as ""Snowpiercer,"" writer-director Bong Joon Ho serves up a riveting, ruthless offering that makes its point clearly but without being heavy-handed or cartoonishly over the top. In doing so, the filmmaker dishes out a wealth of utterly hilarious humor about subjects that ultimately prove to be no laughing matter. Easily one of the year's best, sufficiently award-worthy in many respects, especially in its superb writing, the fine performances of its excellent ensemble cast and a thought-provoking message that should give us all a lot to think about.",1
22,"The biggest surprise of the year. I went to watch the movie without knowing very well what I was going to find, and I left delighted. The artistic direction is 10/10, and the mix of drama, comedy and thriller make the two hours and peak that the movie lasts by flying. Totally recommended.",1
23,"Easily the best movie of 2019. A great movie, it entertains, it thrills and it shocks, thanks to a perfect direction by Bong and some incredible performances from the cast.",1
24,"From South Korea, the movie that will be the worst nightmare of Almodovar and Scorsese. Dark comedy, drama and suspense in the vein of Hitchcock are mixed masterly in the story for a family of phonies and his dastardly art of getting away with it, or almost. Unexpected twists and an unpredictable end will make this one be tattoed in the memory of viewer. Rush!",1
25,"MIND-PARASITIZING!One of the most exquisitely directed, and well-crafted, films of the decade. Give Joon-ho Bong an Oscar from now! (8.5/10)",1
26,"Parasite stands atop the rest of the competition as the best film of 2019. Director Bong Joon-ho delivers his masterpiece, a film that has you hooked from the very beginning. Over the course of Parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention. Just when your investment in the characters peaks, Bong Joon-ho takes Parasite off the rails and delivers a striking message on the innate struggles between classes. Add in fantastic performances and cinematography, and you have the must-see film of 2019.",1
27,Parasite is one the best movies I have watched hands down! Highly recommended,1
28,"Incrível, fenomenal, sucesso total. Uma verdediera obra de 2019, filme traz toda uma relevância para o debate atual sobre qualidade de vida, desigualdade social, luta de classes, violência.",1
29,"Amazing film.  Authentic, real, and a story I have never seen put to film before.  Highly recommend.  10/10",1
30,The movie is the best of the year.There will always be movies like this Befitting oscar,1
31,"I think a ten film is one that you enjoy in the moment, but it stays with you after. I’ll be thinking about this movie for days and will continue to get more out of it as I do so. I thought I would be let down after all they hype and this is not the case. My only complaint is that it does feel a little long at points, although I don’t know what they could have cut.",1
32,"I saw this movie for the third time now. I'm still trying to think of a movie that's better than this one and coming up short. The first ever non-English spoken movie that won the best movie oscar, simply because it was the best movie. It's an amazing story with a twist and an ending that I really didn't see coming. A drama/comedy balance with social commentary that works surprisingly well. The acting is simply great and I think it'll be a while before something better comes to the big screen. It's just really, really good, even after seeing it three times I still love every second of it.",1
33,"An incredible story of a poor family who scams their way into working for a rich family, each taking on a separate role. The movie moves forward and becomes more intense as each moment occurs, culminating in a finish that is thrilling. A fantastic movie that feels fresh and full of new thoughts and ideas even 2 hours in.",1
34,I think the best thing I can say about this movie is how well everything blends together. Bong has truly crafted a film that fires on all cylinders and that alone makes me highly recommend watching it.,1
35,"Parasite is funny and clever at the same time. Through trickster reality, plot is developed under a lot of intelligence and it's almost impossible doesn't hold yourself until movie's end. Probably this year's best movie.",1
36,"I saw bong joon-ho's the host and I can see he brings many of the same themes (poverty, classism, codependent family relationships) in his latest movie parasite. What starts as an endearing tale of a crooked family drama (which gets a bit long in the tooth) takes a hard right into 'lets see how long they can play hide and seek in the house' all the way to 'metaphorical homeless guy lives in the basement and worships the upperclass homeowner'.... So not very subtle writing here! Still the cast are superb here and the cinematography was slightly above average. My only wish is that the screenplay held back from it's flights of fancy long enough for us to enjoy the wonderful texture of that first 30 mins. A decent watch overall.",1
37,"El guión es impresionante, como puede generar entramados de historias, tantos círculos conectados. desde la familia por un lado, desde la ciudad por otro. desde el hogar, desde la calle. desde el suelo, desde la tierra. desde los parásitos y los parasitados. hay muchos binomios",1
38,"I have never cared about acollades. I never watch a film because it has won a Golden Globe or listen to a specific album because it has won 3 Grammys. But this time it has been different. When I saw the huge amount of Academy Awards ""Parasite"" was recieving, I felt the immediate need to see it. And I won't ever regret it.""Parasite"", directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a perfect mix of black comedy, thriller, drama and social critic. It just has everything. The title is also magnificent. It makes you think that you'll see South Korea battling against ""coronavirus"" but no; you'll watch a capturing movie where the word ""parasite"" will recieve another deep meaning: the way poor people are seen by the rich class and how someone opposed to you is a kind of virus inside your house; something that doesn't fit in, that does not belong here nor isn't welcomed.This film is, by far, a must-see for cinema lovers since it has all factors that make a movie perfect. My congartulations to the actors and director who made me cry of joy and of sadness and have made me see how this world is a beautiful mess.",1
39,"Parasite, Bong Joon-Ho's recent Satire of the social class division in South Korea is nothing short of incredible. The film is more or less divided into two major sections:the first half of the film follows a Family living in the poor areas of Seoul (im assuming). After the son Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-shik)is given the opportunity to work as an English tutor in an extremely rich household, he begins to realize that despite having a great income, the adults of the family are not exactly the brightest of induviduals, and so slowly Ki-Woo and his family devise a plan to all come into the employment of their new wealthy acquaintances. Although the film may give a lighthearted impression, once the movie transitions into the second half it becomes extraordinarily twisted, slightly resembling the ending of Robert Eggers's 'The Lighthouse'.After contemplating the events that took place witin the film, It seems obvious to me that Like JB Priestley's 'An Inspector Calls', Bong Joon-ho intends for this movie to display a clear contast between the lives of the rich and the struggles of the poor within this obviously unjust society. Of course it doesn't just rub your face with morals, and there is a very substantial and entertaining plot, but this is one of the main focuses of the movie.As for the other, i'd say that would be the excellent dynamic between characters which is further developed by the brilliant performances from every cast member, particularly Park So-dam who in my opinion was robbed of a Best supporting actress nomination. Other notable features include some top of the line cinematography and a outstanding writing, but other than that I feel there isn't much to talk about.Parasite is an absolute masterpiece, and like so many other films that have come out recently I absolutely recommend it.Fun fact: Elon Musk officially stated that Parasite was his favorite movie of 2019, and whie that's all well and good, the film practically exists to ridicule people like him.",1
40,It is an art and full of mysteries that will always keep you busy wondering what will happen next. No cliches or any nonsense. Straight story telling and great acting. The Director is really good.,1
41,"The film made me feel different things while watching it, like anguish, anger, fear and even joy. It is amazing how the film can change so much from beginning to end without realizing it, and when we notice it, we are already very euphoric waiting for future events. The film is full of super well done scenes. It is usually a discreet angle of the camera that gives us the view of grandeur or claustrophobia. The perfect montage along with the soundtrack, which causes us a lot of anxiety and magnifies the main characters' wooden face, or a big turnaround in the script, containing once again, a montage, soundtrack and performances collaborating so that the scene is quite harmonious . I never thought I'd be in any doubt if I hoped someone would do well or badly in the story. I loved the experience, I loved the film and the social criticism it proposes about class difference, showing in a very discreet way the privileges of some and the lack of privileges of others. Parasite (Gisaengchung), for sure, is one of the best films I've ever seen.",1
42,"Now it's the time to stop that longing, Parasite was just flashed me through my mind and filled that completion of my waiting. Since it was released, it was talked, it was going for awards and it created a history in Academy Awards I was so far and keen to watch this movie and it veils the curtain now. As a movie, it is worth watching because I'm not used to the socio-political aspects of Korean culture. The film describes the class variations and social norm dividing people into rich and poor. But actually what makes me attractive is that kind comic blending at the beginning by the family to enter into the Park mansion. Going smoothly, sometimes it provides a little bit tense and frights the film has a steady graph till the end and then it hype accidentally and I feel astonished. The mood of the movie changed vice-versa and it shook me for some time. A very changing pattern of Korean society and Korean classification was the major essence that I can find in the movie.",1
43,"Solid 10. During the entire movie you will be anxious to find out what happens next. It has a lot if symbolism regarding the movie’s main theme. For a movie that is meant to be so dark, it is quite humorous at times, it’s part of what makes the movie so great.Those who rated this movie with a bad score or didn’t like it should just stick to watching the pile of trash being pushed out by Marvel (like Deadpool). If you’re into that kind of garbage, this is probably not the movie for you.",1
44,"Just incredible. I just couldn't keep myself calm because the movie just keep you awake and trapped. I absolutely loved it, a great film full of plot twists, comedy, entertainment, etc. It has everything, and it's definitely worth watching.",1
45,yesssssssssssasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss,1
46,"Parasite really holds its value. Its interesting how all the negative reviews are butt hurt comments with zero constructive analysis or argument. Overall, I enjoyed every bit of the movie. Its mind-blowing how the movie captures the differences in class by the angle switching and the rhythm of the music. crazy!",1
47,The best script meets the best director with the best cast and an amazing crew. The culmination of such talent results in an amazing movie. A true art form. A genre of its own. PARASITE never fails and flaunts its knives out. The approach is insane with the ever sought plot twists and narratives true to life. The film perfect for all.,1
48,"You know how you read reviews and go into a movie with high expectations. That's what happened to me, seeing all the good review, I had over hyped hopes for this movie. I'm not gonna say they didn't live up to those expectations but.. It wasn't what I was expecting. The story is a bit all over the place and far fetched but hey that's what I'm used to in Asian horror. I'm going to say that this is a must for any asian thriller fans. The again, I don't even think it's considered a horror. Just has some creepy elements to it. I'd say with the story alone it gets a 7.. With the gorgeous cinematography, that bumps it up to an 8. Some really awesome shots from a photographer's perspective. Loved the telephone wire scene. After saying all that, don't take my word for it, actually don't read reviews at all, they can only tarnish the viewing experience. Heck one of my favorite movies is rated a 30% on rotten tomatoes, that goes to show you how much salt should be taken with a review.",1
49,Film bluffant à voir quelque soit vos goûts cinématographiques Évolution scénaristique très intéressante je trouve,1
50,"Parasite is a genre bending film that will stand the test of time. Director Bong Joon Ho has showed that he has mastered his craft as a director and a screenwriter. The theme of class division is consistent throughout the movie and is shown beautifully through visual storytelling, dialogue, and symbolism. The film's social commentary on the two way parasitic relationship between the rich and the poor in today's society is displayed in a very entertaining and creative way. The twists and surprises along with the super intriguing concept of this con-story made for a movie that entertains as much as any film ever made. Narratively speaking, this story is one for the ages, but it doesn't just stop there. Parasite is a beautiful film thanks to its beautiful and purposeful cinematography, and due to its well-thought out production design. Not only is Parasite a beautiful film to visually take in, but every visual aspect of this film is installed for a reason. Most of the time the visual aspects are installed to enhance the theme of class division. The editing of this film took Parasite to levels even further than already discussed. The flawless editing helped the pace of the movie feel flawless, and it enhanced the thrilling vibe that this movie gives off.The actors in this film ground this realistic yet crazy concept of a film in reality. Without their terrific chemistry and performances, I am not sure that the film would've resonated with as many people as it did. Parasite is a beautiful ride of a movie that transcends any other film experience I've ever encountered. Parasite has invented a new genre of film that just doesn't have a name yet. It's message on how there is a parasitic relationship across classes has been relevant for centuries and will always be relevant. Because of this, the pure thrill of entertainment the movie provides, and the technical craftmanship of this film, I believe Parasite will become a film that will be recognized worldwide as one of the greatest achievements in cinema. Parasite is not only my favorite film of 2019, but it may perhaps be my favorite film of all-time.",1
51,"Full of hilarious and tragic surprises. Wildly entertaining.  Though provoking. Gorgeously filmed, masterfully written, superbly acted. Deserved to win the oscar!",1
52,Parasite is the epitome of perfect use of visual language. The reason this film translates so well to American audiences is because of its symbols and cinematography. All of which is due to the brilliant directing.,1

54,"everything about this movie is outstanding. saw it a couple months ago (and rewatched today) and it never got out of my mind. easily the best movie of the year. one of the bests of the decade, or even of the century. Bong is extraordinary. the performances are legendary. the script, production, everything - it will leave u speechless. totally recommend. if it isn't nominated for best picture at the oscars i think imma go insane",1

58,Best Movie I’ve seen this year. So thrilling and clever. Please watch it in the Theaters.,1
59,"I've seen a ton of movies this year, and this one is clearly in my top group.  The storytelling is phenomenal, the visuals are beautiful, and even though things get a touch ""heavy"" in the final third with regard to driving the theme home, it's just an amazing film. The actors are uniformly fantastic.  What starts as sort of a grift/heist/scheme that's light and hilarious turns touching, and emotional.  It's not as momentous as last year's Roma, but if there's justice, this one will get a Best Picture nod, and will actually have a shot to win. Of course, I'm not staking anything of value on that... I have a feeling that academy voters don't watch many of these films.",1
60,"Unpredictable, unique story, fantastic cinematography, and great acting. I can't recommend enough. At the moment this is easily my favorite movie of 2019.",1
61,"Absolutely beautiful, disturbing, and politically timely. I was blown away by Parasite! Go in blind, with no expectations, and you will be shocked to your core!",1
62,Insanely good. I'm still shaken by it and deeply touched at the same time.I have no idea how Meta and Rotten tomatoes' rated Black Panther higher than this. Clearly something off.,1
63,"Parasite is a twisty, energetic ride at the movies, balancing a light-heartedness with thriller-like tension. Aside from its enjoyability as a film - largely due to its superb cast and writing - Parasite makes a visually stunning statement on class and society in the modern age. It’s not always perfect, and may stretch itself to wild extremes, but it’s a cinematic experience you’ll want to come back to again and again, and one of 2019’s definite must-sees.",1
64,"The best film of the year, maybe the best film of the decade. Just one of the best films in general. Joon-ho Bong balances a social thriller, satire and drama, perfectly and effortlessly. The cinematography is as good as I've ever seen in a film; the editing keeps it  highly engaging; the production design adds the impactful disparity between the classes; the score and sound design adds significant character and emotion to each scene; and the performances are powerfully executed from the whole cast. Parasite deserves all the high praise it is receiving from critics and somehow, it deserves more.",1
65,"Claramente o melhor filme de 2019, até então. Uma obra de arte que trata sobre assuntos delicados sem parecer exagerada. Nos faz pensar e ver os detalhes. O roteiro e a direção de Bong Joon-ho estão entre os melhores trabalhos que eu já vi. Simplesmente incrível.",1
66,"We are in 2019, and yet there is a movie that from the start till the end, I cannot predict what is going to happen. The most unique Korean movie, and definitely one of the best Korean movies and Bong Joon Ho's best directed movie I have ever seen.",1

Hughes) Parasite creator Bong Joon-Ho agrees with Hughes that it could dry up, rot, stink, sag like a heavy load, and explode, but more importantly it devastates. A (probably) once charismatic and driven father, Ki-taek, reduces himself to a man with no plan.  Further, he reveals to his son that this is the best plan of all - as you can't get let down that way.  Classism rules the screen as the Philistine Park family does South Korea.  They know no true love, no appreciation for art, and no hobbies, but their money buys them pseudo-happiness- at the expense of Ki-taek's family and the rest of the poor who share his scent. The director adds family dynamics, humor, suspense, gore, and scenery to a film that can only be categorized as art.  Best film of the year!",1
70,"Parasite lives up to all the hype. It's funny, it's thrilling, it's heartbreaking, it's fun.Bong Joon Ho blew my mind. This film will probably remain in my mind forever.The must see movie of 2019!",1
71,The best movie ever! Really amazed by the movie and the actors. Happy to see Koreans making good movies.,1
72,"Absolutely incredible. One of Bong Joon-Ho's best. It's darkly funny, loaded with suspense, and has a deep socio-economic statement that's timely and deep. The cast is awesome, the direction is awesome, the music, the cinematography - everything is awesome. PARASITE, thus far, is easily my favorite film of the year.",1
73,"I have zero interest in Kdrama series, Kpop or just K-musical and cinema industry in general.But this movie, God damn that it's a must watch!",1
74,"This movie is arguably the best thriller I have seen in years. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire runtime, and I can honestly say I never knew what was going to happen next. I  am not going to spoil any plot elements in this review, because I believe you should be as shocked as I was by the time the credits rolled!Every single element that went into crafting Parasite is flawless. The composition of every single shot was immaculate. The soundtrack was intense and beautiful. The acting was out of this world phenomenal. The direction is beautiful. The writing is very well done, and, a lot like Joker, is political without being political. Parasite has a lot to say about classism, and it touches on the relationship of North and South Korea with a perspective that was completely new to me as an outsider. This is a masterfully crafted film, and I hope everyone who can see this movie does.This is truly Bong Joon-Ho's best work. I was sucked into this movie, and I couldn't believe how good it was. I'm not the best at Oscar predictions or anything like that, but this movie won the Palme d'Or, very deservedly I might add! I think this will be a shoo-in for Best Foreign Language Film in all of the USA awards this year.",1
75,"The most prominent aspect of the movie that appealed to me personally, was how the camera takes its time revealing a scene. Just like someone who is watching something unfold in front of them but not completely grasp what they are seeing. It takes on the role of a curious bystander watching it knowing something big is about to happen but not knowing when. In a few words, the movie is - Hilarious, Tragic, Scary and Thrilling at the same time.",1
76,I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie. A definite must see for everyone.,1
77,"""Parasite"" is about as close to perfect as a film can possibly get. I have zero complaints. Nothing. Give it the Oscar. This is the film that people who have tried to make a case for ""Us"" as a Film of the Year contender should watch. It achieves a lot of the same goals while being far better.",1
78,This is not only the best movie of 2019. This is the best movie of the decade. Just go see it.,1
79,"Una pelicula impredecible, llena de intriga y giros argumentales, tienes que verla sin saber nada de ella, eso hará que disfrutes mucho mejor",1
80,"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece.This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my  share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but  Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible. Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You.In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absolutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING.",1
81,"A delicious movie that keeps on serving every minute of its runtime. With gorgeous shots and incredible acting from the cast, this film will be remembered for years.",1
82,_____________________________  _______________________________Between rank and stairs...,1
83,"'Parasite' is without question one of the best films of 2019 and I can see why Joon ho-Bong's film won the prestigious Palme d'Or prize at the Cannes film festival. This is the first film of his that I have seen and I undoubtedly have to watch more of them as I have been meaning to for some time. The film follows a family of a father, mother, son and daughter who are largely down on their luck and unemployed, living in a basement type flat with a low view onto a street usually occupied with a man who gets drunk and urinates down the street in full view of the family. Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) who is the son has a college friend called Min (Seo-joon Park) who visits his home and leaves the family a large rock that Min states will bestow wealth upon the family. Min tells Ki-woo that he is going abroad for study and asks him whether he would like to take over as English tutor for this young rich girl he has been tutoring himself. Ki-woo unsure of how he could considering he is not in college nor an english teacher is told by Min that his knowledge is better than most of his college friends and for him not to worry. Ki-woo is hired by the girl's mother Yeon-kyo Park (Yeo-jeong Jo) after he displays his ability to the mother, and this sets in motion a film that offers such varying emotions and surprises throughout that only a few directors of a very able nature could direct a film of this standard. A fantastic ensemble performance with I think particular praise going to Kang-ho Song as Ki-taek Kim the father. His transitions from comedy to drama are seamless as is the film itself and this blend of comedy and drama always lends a hand in making a film great when it is done well as it is in this case. The cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong was perfect and you can tell when you have an ensemble crew who are masters of their field. It is good to see an East Asian film garnering so much attention and awards buzz.",1
84,It is plain and simple the best movie of this year. Parasite keeps evolving and changing while being always engaging and fun. It is one of the best movie watching experiences you will ever experience - a must-see.,1
85,¿La mejor película del año? - Posiblemente. ¿Obra maestra? - Totalmente.Esta es la primera película del 2019 que se convertirá en un clásico y un gran referente para los cineastas de aquí en adelante.,1
86,"There's an unmatched clarity and precision to Bong Joon Ho's filmmaking.  Parasite doesn't fit neatly into a genre box--it's part drama, part thriller, and part mystery--and the overall spectacle is indeed a worthy winner of Cannes Film Festival's top prize, the Palm d'Or.",1
88,"This is the best film of the year. It is beautiful. thought-provoking, and truly is the most shocking/surprising gems that have been created. The plot centres around a family struggling to get buy and make ends meet. That is all I'll say in regards to the plot. It's something to experience and watch unfold. I didn't know anything about the film walking in and was blown away. Totally recommended.",1
89,"With a first act that unfolds like something of a cheeky Aesop fable for the 21st century, a third act that feels like something straight out of a true crime novel, and a second act that somehow ties these two disparate bookends together, ""Parasite"" effortlessly skyrockets into the heights of memorability for not only this year, but for the past few years, as this is one movie I'm going to have a hard time shaking for days, if not weeks from now. There's so much to every layer of this movie, and co-writer/director Bong Joon-Ho's refreshingly specific vision is the fulcrum of it all. The narrative is so unique, featuring a latter half that's chock-full of events you absolutely can't see coming. The imagery and colors within each frame grow in terms of vibrance as the film goes on. And the overall tone is so brilliantly difficult to pin down to just one note, ultimately giving this movie one of the most incredibly specific voices I've heard in a theater for quite some time. It is, without a doubt, one of the year's greatest feats to behold.",1
90,House under water and tent over the water. The movie PARASITE is the reality we do not want to see.,1
91,"I am speechless. It doesn't get any better than this. This film is a masterpiece and I can't see any better coming this year. Joon-ho Bong keeps on getting better and it's one of the best storytellers of our times, with this film being his Magnum Opus. It touches so many aspects of life with geniality and a dash of dark humor. All is a metaphor and all is explicit, genius. After only one week of it's premier, in my country, I went to one of the few theaters were this film was actually available. Expecting to have a room for myself, this little theater was full, completely full. It just demonstrates that people look also for something more than all the regurgitated bull**it that Hollywood has to offer. Don't miss this film and enjoy it.",1
92,"É um filme interessante, algumas piadas funcionam mais a maioria não, e ele é muito longo e cansativo, mais o plano da familia para serem contratados foi bom",1
93,"My first korean movie, one of the best movies I saw this year, a simple comedic concept which goes into a complex development, amazing acting, emotional and excellent camera work, frame composition and color. I think its a 10 I'm not a critic and for me it felt refreshing and proved once again that asian know movies.",1
94,"The Park family is struggling financially, when the son gets a job teaching English to the daughter of the rich Kim family. In a short time, he brings his parents and sister to work for them…then things take a very dark turn. The film is a bit slow in the first 3rd (maybe straining to make sure the financial inequality theme is clear), but once the twists start, it departs into unexpected areas (literally and figuratively). Director Bong Joon Ho (best known for Snowpiercer) continues to showcase his skills at creating unique and disturbing storytelling. The combo of humor, suspense and violence lends this film an intelligent, yet visceral quality that's sure to stimulate and surprise. (Korean with subtitles)",1
95,"""You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.""'Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. Unpredictable and nuts. You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.I admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies. Not to say I dislike his English language films like 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', but in my personal opinion those don't match the same quality as his Korean movies and there isn't a sex pest trying to control his work. Anywhere, Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best working directors alive and 'Parasite' proves it.The movie perfectly blends drama and comedy so effortlessly, it basically breaks the impossible. And the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. The thing I love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique.The performances from everyone was brilliant and there's so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it's the reason why I was engaged throughout.I highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.Overall rating: Finally, a breath of fresh air. My second favorite movie of this year.",1
97,I have heard film critics rave about this movie since the Cannes movie festival in May of 2019.I have to say I was quite disappointed by this film.I thought the first hour was slow and quite average.There was one great 10 minute scene in this movie but after that the film just falls apart.I have to say that Parasite and The Irishman were two critics favorites that I thought were mediocre films.,0
98,"I’ve been waiting for the hype train to slow down to watch this movie so I could try to go into it without any expectations. I will say everything I’ve heard and read has been very positive about the experience of watching it from friends, users and critics alike. I’ve seen all of Joon-Ho Bong’s films and while I’ve never out right hated any of them, I’ve never thought that they were for me. They tend to be unpleasant and have an obsession with being locked away both physically and emotionally from the outside world. This movie is probably the one I’ve liked the least on first viewing. I didn’t feel like any character was particularly clever and no one had any redeeming qualities. In the end I just didn’t care what happened to anyone in the movie. While that seems to be what Bong is trying to incite, the main thrust of the movie was just too boring and left me unimpressed.",0
99,Funny premise that goes places but completely over-hyped.Can't help but feel that people are celebrating the message rather than the movie which is disturbing.,1
100,"Bong Joon Ho's most recent movie is nothing short than a masterpiece. With great acting performances, beautiful cinematography, an interesting story and weirdly likable characters and a very satisfying third act, Parasite is an instant classic.",1
101,"La película es buena, pero el final tira por la borda todo lo que forma durante al inicio. Lamentablemente no se puede juzgar una película solo por el comienzo sino que el desenlace es casi tan importante como el inicio, es justamente el final el que no demuestra estar a la altura del resto del film.",1
102,"The film is very good but not a masterpiece. It says a lot about the state of art now if a film with so many flows is considered genius. It is not. Actors are excellent but actors are excellent everywhere now days. The script is a problem, as it is the problem in 99% of films. The film begins very well, picks up speed but then loses momentum. The flood spoils it especially.  It was not needed to convey the message, it was too much, too obvious, too in your face. But still, it is a courageous film, which dared to address the problem rarely addressed. It has no real love story, thanks God. Overall, it is great just falls short of a masterpiece some critics claim it to be. it is also very funny at times and definitely universal.",1
104,"Not at all impressed. Whether sad or uplifting, or both, I want to leave the theatre with a new perspective on life. Parasite left me flat, in spite of trying too hard to capture me. I was hoping we would be blessed with 2 consecutive Oscar winners - Green Book and 1917- made to simultaneously entertain and enlighten audiences. Now I fear that the artsy crowd has its ""The Artist"", ""Birdman"", and ""No Country for Old Men"", unwatchable trash that won't rate higher than a test pattern on overnight TV. If Parasite wins Best Picture, might as well put sticks of bubble gum in next year's envelopes.",0
107,"What a waste of time. Can't see what everyone is going on about. The synopsis is very vague and so is the film, as nothing happens and everything is blown out of proportion and nothing is explained or makes any sense.",0
108,"Parasite is the most overrated Oscar winner of all time and apparently nobody is allowed to discuss the flaws, plot holes, and very problematic subtext without being harassed. I am Asian. I will discuss this more later. Least deserving BP winner ever.",0
109,"I liked Snowpiercer, didn’t care for Okja but Parasite was about as perfect as a film can be. A hilarious and brutal depiction of inter and intra class struggle. Must see; not just best of the year but one of the best of all time.",1
110,"this movie so cool. for those who dont like thriller its ok. all thriller on near ending, the quality overall is good.",1
112,I don’t understand this movie at all. Pardon me If I’m not a millennial. But movies that revolve around politics really bore me.,0
113,"Incredibly overrated. It is basically a Korean take on the Japanese movie ""shoplifters"", that tries so hard for satire with exagerated characters, scenes and plot lines. The goal is to shock not to create real art.",0
114,"Gratuitous sex, totally unnecessary to the plot...excessive violence, again not really necessary to the plot.  The story was interesting but not compelling. Cannot live up to high expectations for an oscar-winning best film.",0
115,"Another poor-made korean ""masterpiece"" has been born into this world bringing light of the genius hand of its' makers into unwashed masses, showing true colors of reality, bringing wisdom and ..... freaking clowning.Just like most of the korean TV series a.k.a. doramas - this movie is nothing more than an idiotic grimace for the real world/human relationships/money idiology and lots of other stuff which, by passing through the prism of the director, turned into a giant pile of .... (let your imagination work here).Da movie strips' plot trudges around pathetic attempts of its ""geniuuuuus"" creators trying to show poor korean folk, more known as ""money crased"" (dumbasses), on the contrary side bringing the ""money elite"" which will oppose and confront our parasites and bla-bla. Script - smelling like a bio toilet after its' 1000's usage without being washed nor cleaned, brings tons of ridiculously stupid situations in which characters could make a different (more obvious and more convenient for mentally healthy person) choice that could just cut most of the crap of this movie out, or, numerous scenes obviously overplayed and thus brought to the overstate of their original form, causing my logical tool to erase itself out of the hdd of my brain forever.Actors bum gang - drastically faking and dramatizing every emotion - feels like this is their first acting exp, which is a common sensation after observing korean doramas, so it's ok ;). But the top of this IQ-deprived company are the arisrocrats. Bossy&pumpous to the point where they become dull, supernaive, and even outistic regarding the situations they're currently in or other characters they're currently interacting with - they performed key roles in this circus of idiots....and it was supposed to show realities of life, kick people out of their apathy or at least look like a movie survival manual for modern homo sapiens too lazy/not lucky enough to get a job, but to me it looked like a cheep clowning overexaggerated to the point where it becomes disgusting to watch and can only cause me to put on a dissappointed face and with a deep sigh say ""F**CK YOU OSCARS""!P.S. Mom signed under each word.",0
116,"Basically bad to very bad. Humorous first half turns violent and disgusting.  I get that it’s railing against the system, but do we really need buckets of blood  to say that? Would avoid .",0
117,"Overrated AF,the first half of this movies is amazing but then becomes just unfunny and predictable.",0
118,"BoringWorst movie I have seen all year, people who said good reviews need to wake up",0
119,"The first hours of Parasite is a whirlwind of fun, fascinating, and engaging ideas. Beautiful and inspiring cinematography. The second hour, plus, devolves into a repetitive, rude, ignorant, and self-absorbed malfunction of a movie and screenplay. Bong should have stopped while he was ahead.",0
120,"Simply OVERRATED, first hour it's ok, but the second it's repetitive and boring",0
121,"Es una película buena, pero sobrevalorada. Pensé que había algo más oculto en la película que no me había dado cuenta, así que busqué más información y reviews, pero no hay nada más. La verdad es una película que entretiene, a pesar de ser muy larga, pero no tiene nada especial. No es de sorprender que esté tan sobrevalorada por la crítica, porque la crítica ha evolucionado  para mal, ahora son más doble-moral que nunca, estigmatizan unas películas y sobrevaloran otras. Entonces, yo recomiendo que la vean y saquen sus conclusiones, pero hay tantos cabos sueltos en la película, que es absurda, además la película lleva una línea interesante, a la cual se le da un giro inesperado, muy bueno, pero el hilo inicial se pierde, luego comenzamos a ver un montón de cosas agregadas que tampoco es normal, muy absurdas diría yo.  :::Alerta de Spoiler:::El final es totalmente estúpido, el asesinato al padre del niño por un gesto, se supo que pasaría en ese momento por la tensión de la película, ¿Pero no es totalmente absurdo?. Nunca hubo algo que hablara del resentimiento del señor por su condición, así que fue algo sin base, además ¿A dónde se iría a esconder? Hasta un niño de 5 años pudo deducirlo, pero no la policía, al parecer son muy ineptos en esa ciudad. Pero no en colmo con eso, añaden una parte final de un supuesto futuro, en el que el mejor plan para recuperar a su padre y dejarlo impune, es hacerse millonario y comprar la casa donde está escondido; La idea más idiota de todas.",0
122,"Did I watch the parody of the ""Parasites"" movie that gets such glorious reviews? The rich family had believable characters, but all the grifters in the story were absolutely not believable.  The brutally graphic ending was comical, an over exaggerated blood bath mirroring the graphic ending in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (which by the way I loved). The scene was just that absurd. If I had gone solo, I'd have walked out. As it was, I had to force myself to stay with my date as the urge to leave kept waving over me.",0
124,"After 10 minutes I was ready to leave ""Parasite"" but I can count on one hand how many movies I have walked out on so I decided to stay and find out why word of mouth was being so positive about the film.Basically it is the story of how a very poor family of 4, parents, son and daughter scams their way into the home of a very wealthy family of 4 consisting of the parents, daughter and son. Really can't talk about the movie itself without giving spoilers, though none of them jolted and/or surprised me.The movie is 2 hours and 13 minutes of which 13 minutes could have been cut very easily or spent in explaining some relationships that are sort of glossed over.""Parasite"" takes place in Korea and the differences between the classes are made immediately. The film has subtitles that took me a few minutes to get used to but to which I adapted fairly quickly.I left the theatre glad I didn't walk out but at the same time I really can't see recommending it while, on the other hand, Allen thought it was a classic whodunit.",0
125,"This is South Korean movie from a famous Korean director Bong Joon Ho.I saw a few movies made by him, a drama ""Mother"" and a SciFi ""Snowpiercer"" and I liked both of them.This latest movie ""Parasite"" won the most prestigious prize at Cannes festival, Palme d'Or this year. My expectations were mixed: on one hand, both critics and audience *loved* the movie.On the other hand, it's a black comedy: not my thing.So I went to see it.What can I say? Maybe I am missing something here.I found it not funny at all.Performances were poor.The script - ridiculous.The movie is long: more than two hours. I felt an urge to leave after one hour but I fought it. After an hour and a half I finally left, I could not stand it any longer.I feel like I am not supposed to rate it since I haven't seen it in its entirety but if I had to, it would be 3 out of 10.Once again, I am probably missing something here since it is not my genre.If you usually like black comedies, you may enjoy it as so many people do.",0
126,A Feast for the eye and ear. This 4 Oscar winning film is compelling and ingenious. Do not be put off by the subtitles as this is both quality film making and also accessible to a mainstream audience. The less you know about the story the more enjoyment you will get from the movie. Just be assured this is a real treat!,1
128,"Sin ser la película redonda que la crítica parece hacernos creer, sí que la he disfrutado en el cine debido a ese toque de realismo en el comportamiento humano y, sobre todo, a su crítica social que, sin ser demasiado profunda, siempre se agradece que se tenga en cuenta. La interpretación de todo el reparto cumple sobradamente y nos ayuda a situarnos tanto en la primera mitad de la película, más amable, como en la segunda mitad más cruda. Las dudas que pueda plantearte quedan disueltas con un final brillante.",1
129,"tudo nesse filme é perfeito... a fotografia, a edição, a atuação, a direção... assistir Parasita incomoda, principalmente àqueles que não entendem sua principal mensagem. Já assisti 2 vezes e assistiria mais",1
130,"I felt so many emotions watching Parasite and I'm dying to see it again. There is a reason you've heard so much about this film. Yes, it's true some movies that receive a lot of hype end up not quite living up to it but in this case do not be afraid to believe the hype. It's an original story with superb acting. I've never seen anything like it, one of the best films I've seen in years. Film fans this is not to be missed its phenomenal and will stay with you long after it has ended.An unemployed family (the Kims) take a very keen interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks family, quickly integrating themselves into their lives despite the stark contrast in social status. That's all I'm going to say about the plot because the less you know about Parasite the better. It's incredibly unexpected and does not play out the way you think it would at all. It gives you moments of extreme awkwardness and hilarity. There are times where you have to laugh just to release the ever building tension. It's a comedy, drama and horror all rolled into one masterful movie. Bleak, violent, a dark and twisted story that will constantly keep you guessing.Director and writer Bong Joon Ho has truly outdone himself with this masterpiece. Parasite is one of those rare films you can't stop thinking about after you leave the cinema. It's so profoundly disturbing and bizarre I'm still trying to process it. I understand not everyone takes the time to see subtitled films and to them I can only say you honestly don't know what you're missing. Foreign language films have the extra edge to them, and if you don't believe me then just take the time to see The Host, The Raid or Pan's Labyrinth. Very few foreign language films have the potential to finally break the record by winning a Best Picture Oscar but if anything can do it Parasite can.Unpredictable and highly provocative, I cannot recommend this highly enough. If you only see one film this year let it be Parasite. What else do I need to say? Are you still reading this? Well stop, get yourself to a cinema and see it, you won't be sorry.",1
131,"Overrated movie,are the oscars about politics or about movies nowdays,i just don’t know anymore.",0
132,"I'm a huge fan of Joon-ho Bong's works. The Host and Mother are two of my all time favorite films. Not even joking. Mother made me cry more than any movie ever has. That said, this movie sucks. Beautifully shot but terrible pacing, acting, scripting, and really seems to care more about shoving class differences down your throat and focusing on shock value over actual storytelling.",0
133,é bom demais! chega ser um hino de tão bom!assista. vale a pena! Eu adorei,1
134,"Parasite is a wonderful experience. It's grounded in the amazing realism of our actual world, but given a bit of a push into the surreal. What if the 99% infiltrated each others lives to get closer to something like the lives of the 1%? It's a tasty premise fully realized. The acting is fantastic, and its funny as hell. I'm sure everyone will take something different from it, it's one of those truly skilled works of art that most filmmakers can only hope to attain after a lifetime of creating. Watch it. The audience I saw it with was highly confused and you probably will be too.",1
135,"Movie wasn't that great.  Weird bad overacting, overhyped, cheesy and predictable story.  Far from a masterpiece.  Money buys awards now.",0
136,"Good movie to spend an evening with your friends. A little comedy here is fine, but you won't laugh a lot.",1
137,"La película es magnífica, la historia es narrada desde el punto de vista de la clase baja y lo hace de una forma muy profunda.",1

141,"Bong Jon-ho and the rest of Korean cinema is giving Hollywood a run for its money, and this film is a proof of that. The fact that Western audiences praises this flick like its the second coming is a little too much. Yes, it is highly original, and yes, it shifts its tone from broad comedy to thriller with incredible ease, but Korean cinema has been doing that for the last 2 decades or so. If it takes this flick for film fans to be aware of this incredible film industry, then so be it.",1
142,"Electrifying! Top five movie of the year. Lives up to the rave reviews. Deservedly won Best Film at Cannes Festival. Director at the top of his form! Black comedy, satire, thriller, amazing.",1
143,"The black humour and some scenes are so funny, that they make the movie already very good. But it is also clever in the beginning, where it shows, how the parasite family is getting into the rich family. Fortunately the movie doesnt show the rich family as evil, but they seems to be too simple.",1
144,"Bong Joon Ho’s 2019 release opens with a sub-ground level view out of a semi-basement window outlooking the alleyway of a Korean slum that will play the setting for most of the first act of the film. As the camera settles on this view, Hangul characters discreetly faze into frame and are quickly translated to the American title: Parasite. This seemingly menacing title (for who has any good memories of a parasite?) is in stark contrast to the equally seemingly innocuous backdrop. This opening frame acts as the films first (of many) contradictions that keeps the viewer intrigued and constantly guessing what will happen next all the way up to its thrilling and touching finale.	The film centers around the Kim family: a hard-on-their luck family existing (just barely) amongst the previously mentioned alleyways of the slums that make up the bedrock of this unnamed Korean metropolitan. The family is shown as goofy, well-meaning, cheap, and ultimately entirely relatable. The interesting characters are brought to life by the apparently impeccable talents of the entire main cast. Kang-ho Song acts as patriarch to the Kim family but never acts as the boss. Each family member has a strength to balance any apparent weaknesses they may have. The performances are broad yet nuanced and the dialogue reaches every emotion on the spectrum while always maintaining a hint of comedy. Every character is given a chance to pine as well as get a laugh. If the trailers and posters scare or baffle you, know this: the acting in this movie is worth the cost of admission on its own. The cinematography and writing are all icing on this character-driven cake.	That’s not to say the look and writing of this film are not high points on their own. American viewers will automatically find the Korean setting to be a breath of fresh air with great shots of modern architecture contrasting the dreary shambles of the slums. In every frame of the film, the filmmaker attempts to make the background just as important a character as the people delivering lines. And as the viewers become more accustomed to the diverse settings, the plot constantly creates doubt in our securities and hints at something sinister behind every corner. At the moment you feel most safe, Bong introduces something new that shakes and upturns every notion you built up to that point. This all culminates in a showdown that both strips the viewer of all safety while at the same time establishes a new hope. Walking into the cinema as this film begins, the viewer has a pretty good idea of what kind of film they are in for. But as each scene shifts and every conversation is had in the film, the viewer is treated to something completely new and equally satisfying. The viewer will laugh and cry, cheer and gasp, all while cringing and gripping their seats and this is not an experience offered often to a modern audience. In an age of paint-by-numbers blockbusters, this gem offers a shining example of how great storytelling can be different and completely unsafe. Bong Joon Ho’s own concern about Western audiences reservations about subtitled films rang even more resonant after my viewing as Parasite offers one of the best reasons to hurdle that 1-inch barrier.",1
145,"A sharp social satire and a tense and funny thriller at once, Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" is a contemporary classic that will be remembered fro years to come.",1
146,"certainly, the best foreign film and I have no problem with the palm de or , but best director, original screenplay, and best picture?  I don't get it.",1
147,"A must see? Nah. Interesting, unpredictable, funny, dark, original, tense, and even Shakespearean, so it's good. Bit I think this is the dori of movie that people ""want"" to line.   Cinematically I don't know how Mendes was passed up for Best Director...I don't set what justifies that.  And Bessy Picture? I reserve that for the kind of movies are worth repeating. Without the element of surprise I  don't see the need here.  Watch it.  But a must see?  Only if you see Old Boy first.   THAT is a must see.",1
148,"Brilliant.  The writing, acting and directing combine for a social satire that I still can't get out of my mind.  The images will haunt you, and bring home the real divide that exists across the world - that of class - and its cost in human terms.",1
149,"The movie is a brilliant, very dark and edgy comedy, sometimes even a horror movie. The satire and commentary is brilliant and resonates with me so deeply. All the characters and writing is surprisingly realistic and every character has tons of their own put into them.People obviously enjoyed making this movie, and were even very humble about the rewards they deservedly received. I just REALLY REALLY enjoyed this movie, so much that I literally considered (I will get it on VOD as soon as it gets there) buying a second movie ticket because it left such a DAMN impression on me the first time, I was encouraged to see it over other stuff. After seeing the other stuff I still feel I'd have better spent my time seeing the movie again.It's a perfect 10 in every way: production quality, effects, quality of writing (!), the humor, the horror etc.! You MUST see it, at least once or even twice.",1
150,I would like to give it a 10/10 but small things just barely make me give it a 9. Overall a masterpiece in cinema,1
151,"The somewhat rare genre bender that works, it is clever and unpredictable up to a point, masterfully crafted, and an overt social commentary on class.  It is not this masterpiece classic to be the jackass critics and sheep Academy sing the overpraises of.  The casual cursing by a family to each other throughout is oh so typical liberal depravity that artists think is fine but it's not.  It debases the culture however subtly over time.  The big take away of this film is affirmation there's a reason these crazy goofs can never be allowed to get a nuclear weapon.",1
152,I can't even describe how well written this movie was. Even in your weirdest Dreams you could never come up with THAT TWIST.,1
153,"You may be 14, you may be 40. You may be Korean, Russian or Belgian. None of those matter because there is one certitude: You will LOVE this masterpiece and it's universal, original story. On top of that it has great actors, beautiful cinematography, it's fantastically paced and just a lot of fun really. Realising what the fuss was all about after watching it is a twist in itself. Enjoy !",1
154,"gong Joon-Ho’s ultimate genre-defying chef d'œuvre embodies class warfare and capitalist hysteria.In Bong Joon-Ho’s game-changing social critique, the rich and the wretched descends into capitalist hell in sardonic, comical, and horribly grounded fashion. In times of cholera and uncertainty, Bong Joon-Ho’s latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head-turning accomplishment, a surgically accurate class fable, a truly gripping multi-genre piece of entertainment, and a reinvigorating storytelling-rich decade-new awake. Ever since its Palme d’Or win, “Parasite” has been ground-breaking new history, not only by becoming the very first non-English language, non-epic-length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony, but by giving new life into movie-going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming-service battles and rowdy franchise-building tentpoles.In a way, “Parasite” feels like the “Inception” of this new century. Back in 2010, Christopher Nolan’s towering 160-million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry-wise, putting the absolute, always-coveted formula into one single movie: crushing box office incomes, cerebral, wholly original storytelling, and, above else, priceless craftsmanship power. However, Nolan did not treasure any social-resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon-Ho did overseas. “Parasite”, on the other hand, is a small-budgeted, South-Korean thinking piece that, even while managing different procedures— it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan’s pic —comes to the very same conclusion: great filmmaking is the key. Social-headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like “Get Out” and “The Invisible Man” are proving that studios, either big or small, may still conquer audiences with entertaining, on-point storytelling.  Script-wise, “Parasite” is an utter knockout. At first glance, the most outstanding, praised features the film exposes now and again are its turns and twists, the comings and goings of a story where everything mutes into something unexpected. These “think-again” premium plot devices are the main pulling force for mainstream audiences, even though they are not the most powerful assets Joon-Ho has to offer. The truly one-of-a-kind centerpieces are: proceedings and composition. Take for instance the 5-minute towering montage at the end of the first act, where black humor, cadence and rhythm are the beating heart of the sequence. It builds and places anticipation at the highest level by using endless narrative tricks to convey the emotions and reactions the film intends to spring up, blurring the line between good and bad, between wealth and the poverty, between sarcasm and irony. Every one of the characters succeeds at becoming storytelling backbones because of the amazing ensemble cast, which— by the way —became the very first foreign Ensemble Winner at SAG Awards, making, one more time, movie history. Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-shik, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Song Kang-ho deliver award-worthy performances, endowing to the story tangible, three-dimensional characters that, in incompetent hands, would come out as hollow caricatures.    Bong Joon-Ho’s pictures are described as many things at once: black comedies, social commentaries, genre-crossing post-apocalyptic adventures. Owning every inch of them, “Parasite” spices the mix up with deeper, timely metaphors— make no mistake, peaches and basements are not going to be the same; — however, the film owes it to two crucial aspects: visual language and edition. Camera movements, blocking and visual composition are masterfully managed by the director and his crew. It could have been a silent film, and still it would speak volumes. Cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo executes his vision with perverse precision and voyeuristic delight, grabbing class divide by the throat. What could have ended up as a mere style exercise between the shady lighting from the semi-basement and the luxury LED lighting of the main mansion, it is now the perfect visual cocktail:  sophistication and softness, luxury and poverty, ups and downs, dark and light, hungry beasts in empty spaces. “Gisaengchung” by Bong Joon-Ho is the crowning achievement of the decade. Many critics have healed it as “the picture of the year” and, even if it is tout à fait true, “Parasite” transcends the boundaries of society-headed, industry-transforming films; say Jordan Peele’s ambitious allegory “Us” reimagined through the lens and voices of Shakespeare, Hitchcock and Kim Ki-young, and still you are nowhere near to it. Many talented, socially-aware filmmakers and their equally committed crews have paved the way through the years; now Bong Joon-Ho, in total command of his craft, has made it: “Parasite” is a groundbreaking work of art.",1
155,"Parasite is the kind of movie that needs to be seen by everyone. This film is funny, is suspenseful, is a satire, it has everything. Bong Joon Ho has created a complete masterpiece fill with amazing performances, great cinematography, excellent music and a screenplay that will be studied for years to come.",1
156,"This movie forces me to make this review. It's a masterpiece, watch it, you will never forget it.",1
157,"As one other reviewer said, all the accolades have to do more with the idea other than the actual movie. TEchnically it is very well crafted, great cinematography, great acting, but personally I think overhyped. In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues, a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor, (a little bit too stereotipically, I might add) is bound to get great reviews. Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess, and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done jsutice, even if only for two hours on a theater. Hollywood wants to be that White Knight, and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio, this year it was the Korean actors, I'll bet next year it will be another troupé. Like the rich family in the movie, minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood, useful and good while they serve their purpose, stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don't. Watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind, I don't think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it. Beware though, last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory.",1
158,"Mi punto de vista e impresiones:Una sátira sobre las clases sociales que en definitiva no dejará indiferente a nadie.Es difícil encasillar a esta película en un género porque realmente tiene de todo.Leí excelentes críticas que la calificaban como una de las mejores películas del año y de la década y ahora que acabo de verla, es completamente cierto, en mi opinión tiene todos los méritos para ubicarse en el primer puesto de la mejor película del año, disculpando a Joker y a Midsommar que hasta el momento compartían el primer puesto, pero me tomaré el atrevimiento de ubicarlas a ambas en el segundo lugar y a Parasite no hay nada que la saque del primer puesto y saben el por qué? La trama es interesante, los personajes son fabulosos y muy ingeniosos, el ritmo es atraparte y el guión y dirección son absolutamente increíbles, ambos son sumamente inteligentes, mordaces y por sobre todo sublimes, estoy realmente fascinado por la película que acabo de ver, se las recomiendo a todo dar.Sobra decir que le doy 5 ⭐ de 5 ⭐",1

163,"Not a fan of the director (I loathed Snowpiercer) and movies with this must critical acclaim usually suck. But by far the movie of the year. In tone, in terms of black humor/crime/thriller it ""feels"" like the same world as Joker. Amazing visuals and lots of interesting layers to sift through. I think you can watch it just as a movie and enjoy it. It's not supposed to be realistic, but stylized, so go in knowing that. But pay attention and this movie is deeply rewarding. The disgust the rich people have for what was found in the car and how they use it in role play later on... the father telling his son that planning life doesn't work and then the ending... the subtle and clever aspects of the class struggle and how the house plays into it. So many layers if you want to look for it. This is an astonishing piece of well crafted fiction.",1
164,"Yes, Parasite was well crafted and uniquely entertaining; but an earth-shattering masterpiece? Come on. It was a comically cliche portrayal of class division served up with a big, heaping  scoop of shock-value. I enjoyed the ride, but it’s not the magnum opus it’s billed to be.",1

166,"Filme muito bom, ganhou o oscar não foi por acaso, com personagens muito bem desenvolvidos e com uma historia muito bem escrita com diversas metáforas e reviravoltas no ponto certo, acredito que os pontos positivos qualquer um consegue achar em tudo, mas falar dos pontos negativos é um pouco mais difícil, na minha concepção pelo fato de ser um filme coreano e não estarmos tao familiarizados com a interpretação deles, em muitos momentos parecia muito forçado algumas interpretações de forma que o filme parecesse muito mais cômico do que deveria, isso pelo fato das mensagem do filme ser clara (apesar de muitos culparem um lado ou outro, ideia errado ja que ambos os lados são culpados por suas atitudes), outro ponto negativo ao meu ver é o final que se estendeu de uma forma desnecessária ao ponto de deixar as coisas ainda mais confusas, e por fim outro ponto negativo e talvez o mais importante foi que na primeira metade do filme tudo pareceu muito previsível, todavia vale ressaltar que a segunda metade tomou um caminho completamente diferente causando a todo minuto duvidas do que aconteceria em seguida",1

173,"Definitely deserved Best Picture award. The movie features incredible cast and screenplay. It has delivered in almost all fields of filmmaking.However, even that i understood the film's message, i feel the plot could have been done even better. I had higher expectations from it.Watch it anyway! :)",1
174,"I don't know what to say about this film apart from how this film is masterful film making. I don't even want to give a synopsis for this film as this film is best experienced with no knowledge whatsoever.The plot is amazing and extremely gripping with every twist and turn. Likewise, the way it tackles the social themes is so intriguing and done so extremely well even if the theme has been done many times before. The entire cast is amazing and honestly not even one of them getting a nomination for best acting is quite the robbery. Huge praise to Song Kang-ho and Park So-dam especially, they gave amazing performances. The cinematography/set design is also impressive and uniquely correlates with the ongoing story. The use of staircase and lines to tackle the ongoing theme, while not subtle, is done extremely well. The soundtrack, while not exactly memorable, manages to elevate the tense atmosphere and keep people on the edge of their seats. Finally, the film is absolutely entertaining with the way it incorporates contrasting genres, black comedy and thriller, into one surprisingly cohesive and exhilarating movie. THIS IS A MUST WATCH! It deserves best picture for a reason.",1
175,"Parasite is an extremely potent movie with an incredible amount to say. Despite having been out for several months, I feel that many of the film’s true intentions won’t be realized for some time. The film is, as it openly admits, “extremely metaphorical”, almost every decision feeling well-meant and multi-layered. Many people have stated their interpretations of the work, and I feel most of them are missing the point. Parasite is a satire, yet many people seem to be taking it at face value. In an interview, Bong stated that calling lower-class individuals, people who have no feasible means of class mobility, parasites is missing the point; it is the upper class who saps off the lower class via class warfare and exploitation who are the real parasites. In this way and many more, Parasite likely doesn’t affirm the viewer’s world view, it may seem to do so, but this misconception is illustrative of the divide between reality and perception. Parasite, even if watched as an ideologically vacant film is still incredibly deep, with well-placed reincorporation and a constantly evolving plot. Despite its dark undertones and periodically graphicly violent scenes, Parasite remains to be intensely funny, a humour derived from the absurdist reality of the film’s world and premise.",1

178,"I can't recommend enough this movie to anybody, it has amazing rhythm and editing that it makes it look like it is easy. The plot slowly but surely unveils and it gives you enough clues for you to uncover a lot of its themes beforehand, not that is predictable mind you, but is not unfair or cheap, so several views are recommended.I don't want to speak a lot of the plot so I won't spoil anything, but is not only an extremely well done and entertaining movie, it also serves as an actual social commentary about the poor and the wealth, it is also so well written that it doesn't tell you a moral, it makes you question yours. Please see it with an open mind and make your own conclusions.",1
179,"Kesinlikle harika bir film. Günümüzün sosyal değerlerine ve sınıf ayrımcılığının ne kadar itici bir şey olduğuna çok güzel dokundurmalar yapan şahane bir yapıt. Komedi, dram ve suç ancak bu kadar iyi harmanlanabilirdi.",1
180,"An uncategorisable masterpieceWhat is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define Parasite? Part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. What is certain is that it's exceptional in just about every way – screenplay (co-written by director Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography, mise en scène, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things – it lives up to the hype.The Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment eking out a meagre living folding pizza boxes. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo bluffs his way into working as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park family. Father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) welcome Ki-woo into their home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families.As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as Parasite is, it remains an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. This is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, but never before has he been this caustic and acerbic, but so too compassionate and witty. One of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is his avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics – the Kims are by no means a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels.Bong is uninterested in trucking in heroes and villains because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, whilst the Parks' greatest crime is allowing their wealth to insulate them from the world of families such as the Kims. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims often occupy the same frame, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot. Important here is the title. A simple reading is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, Bong depicts the Parks as parasitic as well, feeding off of the labour of their servants. Just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what is a symbiotic relationship.Aesthetically, Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography is magnificent. Hong also shot the superb Beoning (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks' house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' cluttered and dilapidated apartment contrasted with the Parks' pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house.It's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found. As a story at least partly in the tradition of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" subgenre, Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below by using stairways as a recurring motif. The Kims' apartment has no stairs, indicating their inability to rise socio-economically. On the other hand, the Parks' home has two stairways – one going up to the bedrooms where the four children spend an increasing amount of time, cut off from their parents, and one going down into the cellar. Bong shoots this stairway like he's suddenly directing a horror film, bestowing upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing.Parasite is a masterpiece, with Bong never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie – a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich – but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy and so on. This is cinema as art, a film which has proven itself very much a game-changer and completely deserving of every bit of praise it's received.",1

186,"It’s rare for a foreign film to gain as much popularity with American audiences as the South Korean film Parasite has done. It’s even rarer for a foreign film to earn Academy Awards nominations for Best Foreign Language (now called International) film and Best Picture, but Parasite has managed to join this exclusive club. Director Bong Joon-ho has long been turning out top quality, intriguing work (I’m a big fan of his melancholy 2003 film Memories of Murder, about a years long hunt for a serial killer). Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won’s Oscar nominated original screenplay switches tones and even genres so abruptly and successfully, it makes Parasite a unique movie to say the least. Combined with a stellar cast, excellent cinematography, production design, and pacing, Parasite becomes a thoroughly engrossing, extraordinary experience. Movies like this in any language are rare indeed.Parasite begins as a dark comedy and sharp satire about economic inequality and class disparity. The Kim family lives in a shabby basement apartment. The street level window provides them a view of ankles and urinating drunks. They work short term odd jobs and hunt around their apartment for a spot with Wi-Fi. A change in luck comes when a friend of their teenage son recommends him as a tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, the Parks. The son, Ki-woo, reluctantly accepts though he is under qualified. Soon the Kim family schemes to replace each of the Park family servants with themselves though they pose under false identities. The 20-ish Kim daughter, Ki-jeong, provides the family with false credentials. Things take a fateful and irreversible turn when the Kims decide to have a night in luxury while the Parks are away for the weekend.That plot description seems to make the title describe the Kim family. As you watch them work their way into the home of the Park family, you may find the title applies more to the Parks whose lifestyle requires people like the Kims. The differences between a family that is oblivious of their wealth and a family that schemes to get stable, working-class jobs is apparent. But then, the film reveals layers and depth that make it truly profound. When the film becomes a riveting thriller, it does not eschew its themes and substance. I cannot recall the last time I had no idea where a film was going, not because of incompetence, but because I was watching the work of a master filmmaker.The entire ensemble is terrific. Each role is well cast and there’s a great chemistry between the members of the respective families. The stand outs for me, however are Song Kang-ho as the Kim family patriarch and Park So-dam as his clever daughter. Cho Yeo-jeong as the daffy and gullible Park matriarch is great comic relief.What sets Parasite a step above other socially conscious films is it does not sacrifice entertainment for the sake its social commentary or vice versa. It never pontificates or pretends to have any didactic solution. It is like a classic Twilight Zone episode, up front about its themes but in such a way that doesn’t speak down to audience and feels detached and immediate simultaneously. There is not a single pandering moment in the entire film. Parasite uses the real problems and concerns of modern society to tell a compelling and universal story that causes us to reflect on our world. That can be the definition a great film and great art.",1

It's so much in so little time. This movie achieves to be in like five different genres and never feels inconsistent. The transition from a standard drama to a comedy, then to a horror film, then to back to a drama, back to a comedy and so on feels so natural and never took me away from the movie. This might be one of the most funny non-comedy films of 2019, one of the best acted, one of the best written and one of the most entertaining yet complex films I've seen in 2019. There wasn't a single moment that felt slow or boring, the movie never stops and constantly moves forward to show us something new about the characters and the story and does it in an incredibly entertaining and engaging way. This movie is also really intense. It creates tension so well while also making you laugh or feel scared or disturbed. It's just too much to handle. It's a complete cinematic experience that I think I didn't get with any other movie I saw last year and I've at least seen all the Best Picture Oscar nominations and I have to say that this is the best out of all of them.

195,"An unpredictable film full of intrigue and plot twists, you have to watch it without knowing anything about it, which will make you enjoy much better",1
196,Speechless! Extravaganza...words are worthless to define such Great piece of cinema! Right from the start we were too much into the story that I was shocked the movie is over like 15 mins only!such smooth screenplay with simple but effective score with an hinge of doubts it was sure a classic cinema!,1
197,"Just brilliant. A look at the consequences of capitalism. The script is very well done and it is very difficult to understand where the film is going, which puzzles you all the time.",1
198,Absolutely mind-blowing. Expect the unexpected. The film is thoroughly enjoyable and equally thought provoking,1
199,Eu amei tanto esse filme...................................................,1
200,Congrats To Director To Pick This Story For The Genre ! It Changes My Mind That Cheating Is Not Bad If The Purpose Is Survival ! This Movie Also Shows Slaverysm And Racism In Reality As No People Shows It Directly To Our Face ! Acting Is Excellent ! Cameraman Deserves An Award ! Ending Was The Best ! Plot Twist Also Attratcts The Audience ! This Story Is So Difficult To Be Done In A Fast Screenplay ! But They Convey The Feelings Successfully,1
201,"Amazing! A film full of metaphors, social criticism, minute details, a direction that takes control of the entire film from beginning to end. A film that is worth seeing again, again, and again, you notice details that the first time I didn't notice for lack of information, but that now make sense and give even more richness to this work. Simply fascinating!",1
202,Im still just shocked. This 'movie' is actually 2 different movies smoothly put into one. It's nothing but perfect cinema. You can sense the amount of work and genius that has been put in this thing.,1
203,"The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes. A monumental (but easy-to-consume) piece of art that satisfies all audience's tastes. Highly recommended.",1
204,"I saw Parasite 3 months ago to the date of this review. It's not until now, that I can say this is the best movie I have ever seen. I have thought a long time about what its about and what I saw. It's a movie where when you think you got it all figuered out, the movie just turns at an opposite direction. It's a masterpiece like nothing I've ever seen before. Parasite definitely deserves the Academy Award for best picture, because it is the best picture I have ever seen.",1
205,"I'm going to refer to this as ""The Movie"" from now on until I find something fully encapsulates what cinema can achieve in a better fashion. We certainly haven't seen something that could surpass this in the decade before it was released.This was simply perfection.",1
207,"Lo primero que vemos en Parasite es la ventana de un sótano que da a ras de suelo de una calle iluminada por el sol. Y nos quedamos con esta imagen hasta que se da el primer movimiento de cámara del filme, cuando ésta desciende y, sentado en el suelo del sótano, vemos a uno de los protagonistas de esta última producción de  de Bong Joon-ho. Solo con eso, el director y el cinematógrafo han establecido el tema principal de la película, que será desarrollado a lo largo de 132 minutos: el lugar que ocupan los pobres y los marginados. Bong Joon-ho es un cineasta muy sencillo. Sus películas cuentan historias complejas, de profundo contenido social, pero siempre utilizando los recursos cinematográficos más básicos para reforzarlos. Sus películas son, para el ojo entrenado, lo que una sinfonía de Bethoveen es para un oído entrenado: sublimes. Y lo mejor de todo es que no necesitas años de entrenamiento tipo conservatorio para apreciar lo sublime en los filmes de Joon-ho. Solo necesitas mirar con atención.Todo está en los ángulos y los movimientos de cámara. Es con ellos que Bong Joon-ho deletrea los aspectos más importantes de su trama, mientras el guion y las actuaciones se encargan de desarrollarla. Para eso el director coreano se vale de un control absoluto de lo que muestra, cómo lo muestra y a qué ritmo lo muestra. Hay que pensar en sus películas como coreografías entre el elenco y la cámara, llenas de escenas en las que cada movimiento importa porque todo relata o refuerza algo. Por eso Joon-ho nunca se complica demasiado con su cinematografía –aunque sí con los objetos, la profundidad y los colores de su diseño de escenarios–, y más bien mantiene sus ángulos y movimientos de cámara dentro de lo básico y consistente. De esta forma, una vez que entramos en ritmo, podemos bailar con su filme, tal como el elenco está danzando con la cámara.Y eso nunca fue más cierto que en Parasite (2019), donde Bong Joon-ho refina su habilidad de ser leve en el caos y oscuro en la levedad. Como dije ya, la película comienza con un movimiento de cámara que nos introduce a la pobreza de un hogar de gente que tiene que hacer de todo para conseguir dinero y sobrevivir. A lo largo del filme los veremos abajo, intentando ascender y lográndolo a medida que la película es una divertida y perversa comedia en la que esta familia pobre se infiltra como la servidumbre de un lujoso hogar de gente adinerada. Es tan básico y consistente el lenguaje visual de Joon-ho que a esta familia adinerada la muestra siempre arriba: ubica su hogar en las colinas, los separa de su servidumbre por líneas naturales del escenario, los pone en espacios iluminados y abiertos para remarcar la claustrofobia en la que viven los otros, los marginados.Parasite es un filme que está en constante diálogo consigo mismo. Cada acto, cada escena, tienen una consecuencia a lo largo de una película cuyo giro pareciera cambiarla por completo. Bong Joon-ho es un maestro del tono, puede hacerte reír en un momento oscuro y despertar un miedo dentro de ti en el momento más ridículo. Pero en Parasite esto es más intenso. De una comedia perversa pasamos a un caos contundente, a algo tan extraño y tan violento que seguramente es cierto. Y en realidad es un giro de trama que no hace más que reforzar el tema principal: el lugar de la pobreza en la sociedad, cómo funciona la división de clases o, en palabras del mismo Joon-ho, cómo en una sociedad capitalista la unión solo es posible en cómo una clase utiliza a la otra. ¡Y el elenco! Cada actor y actriz encarnan a sus personajes de una manera tan efectiva, que no dudamos de ellos ni cuando la historia da su giro. Joon-ho ha trabajo con grandes como Tilda Swimton, Jake Gyllenhall, Ed Harris, Chris Evans y los resultados son increíbles, pero habla muy bien de él que pueda hacer lo mismo y hasta tal vez más con un elenco de su Corea del Sur natal –entre ellos su actor mimado Song Kang-ho– desconocidos para una gran mayoría. Para cuando llega el final de la película –ese final delirante que nos deletrea la imposibilidad de ascender que tienen la clase baja y hasta la clase media–, el elenco ha hecho tan buen trabajo que ese último golpe de la trama a los personajes, es también un golpe a nosotros, a nuestras propias fantasías económicas, es un llamado a mirar de nuevo como dividimos las clases en nuestras sociedades.",1
208,"A very pleasant surprise of how to combine something mysterious, and something with great horror elements but keeping it light with perfect black humor and not to give away too much at any point. The movie has this soft tension build up all throughout story progression and never really settles down on one tone.Shortly after the start you kind of get the idea where things go, but you have no clue what is going to happen after that and how the protagonists are going to deal with the difficulties they are facing. The script was very cleverly written, makes you face a decision who you are rooting for. I could sympathize with either the “good guys” or the “bad guys” at any given point during the movie.This movie should be a great example to Hollywood how to write and direct an original title, this is a Korean gem that will go down as one of the best in its genre and category.",1
209,"Funny, light, thoughtful, deep, suspenseful, dark, all the thingsVery intelligent film that weaves together many different perspectives and tones masterfully. Several different levels to think about and discuss with others. It will leave you thinking about it for days afterward just to ponder it a bit more. Definitely tell your friends to watch it because you'll want someone to discuss it with. This is a full-course dinner that leaves you perfectly satisfied :)",1
210,"When you see ""Parasite"" your eyes will be so glued to the screen that they will feel sore if you take them off, this film is a near perfect conglomeration of social-political satire, heist film tension, and superb tonal shifts.",1
211,"This movie really left me speechless. Parasite is probably the most different movie of recent times. The plot is light at first, but it becomes increasingly bizarre. The direction of Bong Joon-Ho is very simple, ensuring the viewer a very comfortable experience. The script is intriguing and curious, can keep the viewer completely glazed in the story. These are very good performances by Koreans, which show true performances. The movie ends up getting a little lost in the final act, but nothing that spoils the experience. It is very worth it. Parasite is a great movie.",1
212,Yeah this is a good movie. I usually don’t like Korean cinema that much but this one kills it.,1
213,I thought it was really good and really well done. The only thing that brought it down for me a little bit was that the resolution dragged on.,1
214,This movies make me sad.I just thought why everything in this world be like this why humen be like this.,1
215,"Don’t like captioned movies BUT Parasite was wonderful,funny,silly, and very entertaining!Recommend it very highly and see why it won so many awards!!",1
216,Amazing. I really don't have words to describe how I felt watching this. It was dark and sad but also funny at the same time. It completely trapped me.,1
217,"i just can’t fathom life without this gorgeous **** movie. this changed the way i see film, and its storytelling is enough to haunt you for weeks. i don’t know where to begin even dissecting this, just go watch it for yourself and watch history in the making.",1
218,"A really good movie, there's no much about it that can be said without spoiling it, but it was worth the time.",1
219,"To sum this movie it up, it is a black comedy, a thriller, a horror and a social satire in 2 hours. Seems like a lot in 2 hours, but not only is the message of class division clear, Bong presents it in the most accessible and humorous way… Expand",1
220,One of the most well-crafted movie put in history. Each scene is paced like a swiss watch. Bong Joon Ho is a master crafting a masterpiece,1
221,Simply a fantastic movie and one that should serve as a standard for future films about relevant social themes.,1
222,One if the best movies of 2019. Awesome Director and very awesome casts. Congratulations!,1
223,"Be A Host for ParasiteThe Stream: Are you going to complain that this is a foreign language film? Okay, fine.The Big Screen: Completely surprising at every turn.The Final Bill: Enjoy the ride.– Trip FontaineParasite reminded me that there are actually some original ideas out there being made into movies. It also reminded me how annoyed I am by all of the sequels and remakes and reboots that have flooded Hollywood and American mainstream movie theaters. Directed and co-written by Bong Joon Ho, who also directed Snowpiercer and Okja both of which are on Netflix, Parasite is a South Korean film with English subtitles about… well, this where reviewing this movie gets difficult because I don’t want to spoil anything. Um… it’s about an out of work family who through a series of events find work and surprising things occur.There is so much to admire about Parasite. The screenplay is so good because, while the setting may be foreign to American audiences, the story is familiar and takes unexpected turns that when you really think about them the turns were always somehow inevitable. The point of view is funny and insightful. The themes once completely revealed are devastatingly universal.A further boon to Parasite is that the cast is great. Each member of the cast gets to shine in their distinct ways. The chemistry is familial and easy. The father played by Song Kang Ho and the daughter played by Park So Dam are the standouts; but, uniformly, each character plays their essential part in this tale. I’ll also note how the production design is architecturally awe-inspiring and meticulous. The sets that were built for the film tell just as much of the story by just existing as do the dialogue and the actors.Parasite is an absolute must-see. If it is in a theater near you, take the opportunity to enjoy this spectacle on the big screen. Do not read any spoilers. Go into this one knowing as little as possible.",1
224,"'parasite' A parasite is a living organism that receives nutrients from the host body And parasites are not good for the host bodyWhat if two parasite organisms come together in one host body? .this is what the 'Bong joon Ho' put forward to us .the main theme of film is  Characteristics of Human Beings Changing their circumstances.Reality is that after all, more than half the species on Earth are parasites, and most organisms are host to a number of them.kim ki- taek is a poor man who lives in a basement home with 4 of his family members.the only family income is Proceeds from pizza cover making.One evening at dinner, a friend of Kim Ki-woo's (Kim Ki-woo is  Ki Taek's son) came to visit ki-woo and he gifted his grandfather's a collection stone to them and forward a job opportunity to ki-woo.  Ki-woo makes a fake certificate and looks forward to that job, and then he starts teaching Mr. and Mrs. Park's daughter in their home permanently. da hye fall in love with ki -wooMrs. Park's son da - songHe is a child of disobedience but he is highly talented of drawingKi-woo sees this as an opportunity and recommends his own sister as a drawing teacher and an art therapist, But really, she’s not one of these and she also enters the house.Kim ki - taek tells  his family ""rich people are realy gullible""The two Kims plan to dismantle Mr. Park's driver and appoint their father as the driver, and then the entire Kim family together plan to disband the hose keeper.  Kim's wife comes to the house of the park's housekeeper, and they all continue to workIt is here that the name of the film becomes a make sense  Kim's family life goes well in that house. One day Mr. Park's family goes on a camping trip because tomorrow is his son's birthdayKim's family gathers at Mr. Park's house that night, unbeknownst to ParkSuddenly, the former house keeper gets there and changes the story of the entire course That night, everyone in the house changes their lives.If I say anything more about this movie, it will affect the enjoyment of the film.Bong joon ho was able to make the screenplay of the film nuancly crafted Everything that comes out of this movie is interconnected, even a stone.Kang ho song's performance as  ki - taek is subtle.The acting of kang's  physically and mentally embracing the mannerism of the character is commendable.The storyline, which goes on as usual, is as terrifying as it gets near the end of the story.The director was able to intensify all the situations in the film, and he is worthy of applause.(example :Ki - taek tells to Mrs. park that your house keeper has TB.the housekeeper takes a coughing when Ki - taek and Mrs.park steps up the stairs then the camera focus toward Mrs.park's face The director edits those scenes into Slowmotion)",1
225,perfect and heartbreaking. i just love it. its so professional and well done,1
226,"I had this in my queue to watch for a couple weeks now, but the recent Oscar win forced my hand. I can definitely see why critics and voters liked this film, and I don't think there will be much dissent from the common viewer. It is certainly the best I saw in 2019.",1
228,"Parasite was a brilliant movie with incredible characters who develop throughout the whole story. The theme of class struggle was exhibited extremely well. The lower class people were placed physically lower than the richer people. The basement of the rich home also houses a poor Man who is separated from them by multiple flights of stairs. The poor people’s homes are flooded by the literal waste of the rich homes. As the Ki family physically gets higher and higher, their social status does too. The higher they go the more their personalities change also. They end up fighting a family who is in a very similar situation to them. The members of the Ki family have changed their personalities so much they now act like they are rich and threaten to call the police on them. The film tries to show how wealth changes people and does it very well. Just like the title implies, having wealth is like a parasite that grows and grows once it gets it grip on someone. The Ki family his ok with pushing other families down as long as it means they stay comfortable in their newly gained wealth.The film also does a great job of illustrating how the rage in Mr. Kim grows throughout the film. The rich family says they hate the smell of him and essentially poor people as a whole. They say they smell like the subway. Then as Mr. Kim returns to work after having his home flooded by the rainfall, the rich mother says that the rain was a blessing and that it made for such a great day. Then Mr. Park reminds Mr. Kim that he is being paid and is an employee not a friend. The final straw comes when Mr. Park holds his nose when he gets near Mr. Kim while trying to retrieve his keys. Mr. Kim then stabs him in anger. This is a representation of how rich people treat poor people with so much disdain and poor people one day won’t be able to take it any more.The cinematography was really good as well. There were so many small details that made the movie great. One great example of this was when the homes were flooding, the lights blinked SOS in Morse code.",1
229,"Parasite is a richly creative & wonderful dark dramedy that reaffirms your faith that if you just give movies a chance, they might just blow you away. This is a story about class differences on many levels- not just money- and the people trying to cope and coexist. The beauty here is the viewer is hit with all sorts of surprises and twists. One never knows what is just around the next corner. Parasite is so unique and clever in a time that creativity is in rare supply. I don't usually ever give A+ marks to movies, but this one earns it. It is definitely worthy of its Best Picture Oscar and one not to be missed.",1
230,"It was good that the movie plot was not cliché, especially because the ending was not obvious.",1
231,En başta film nasıl ilerleyecek diye sıkıldım.Fakat izledikçe ilginç olmaya başladı.Çok farklı enteresan ve güzel bir kurgusu var. Beklenmedik bi başyapıt izledim.10/10,1
232,"Beautifully crafted movie. Bong Joon-ho has come a long way to the top, and apparently he mastered all the  skills required for making a great movie. Can't wait to see his next movie. Oh, and if you haven't seen his earlier works (""Mother"", ""Memories of Murder"") - go check them out immediately.",1
233,"La película logra construir a sus personajes de forma perfecta, casa uno tiene un propósito una motivación y una personalidad única, el director consigue hacer una cruda representación de las diferencias sociales en el mundo, aunque sea una película koreana está película habla un idioma universal",1
234,This movie is unique i would like to see more about these type of movies 10 of 10,1
235,This suspense thriller is articulated with so much control that it keeps any viewer invested for more.,1
236,"The perfect example of contemporary art. Easily digestible for the masses, as it's a very entertaining film, but also extremely important and complex for those who seek more than just a way to spend 2 hours of their lives. And that creates the confusion of ""good, but overrated"", because this film is art disguised in common clothes.Therefore it became mainstream, and a lot more people that look for fast-food cinema ended up watching it. So obviously they cannot understand where the 10/10 and the 100% are coming from. Their confusion is justified. But just because you are not qualified enough to get it, doesn't mean it's trash or ""overrated"".Even though I adore this film, I only suggest it ti people that I know can and will appreciate it. It's a shame to watch this film through the eyes of a Marvel/DC-fanboy. So if you're not into this kind of cinema, better stay away. Don't jump into the train just because it's ""in"" atm. However, if you like an extremely funny, impeccably made and thought provoking film, that will stay with you for days after you watched it, and you are ready to actually concentrate and pay attention to details, then what the **** are you doing? Go watch it right now!",1
237,"A timeless Masterpiece, a review wouldn’t do this film proper justice, just go watch it.Well deserving of its four oscars in Best Picture, Directing, International Feature Film and Writing (Original Screenplay). Still i am a bit dissapointed that non of the cast was even nominated for acting. All around gripping and mesmerizing preformances & plot.",1
238,"Absolute masterpiece, worth anybodies time. I see a small amount of people complaining about violence or sexual content, but to really have a good look at society you cannot shy away from the more gruesome sides of people.",1
239,Bong Joon-ho continues to establish himself as one of the most original working directors with this multi-layered dark comedy,1
240,"The hype behind this move is deserved. Went into see it thinking it was likely just another overrated movie but delighted to be proven completely wrong. It's best to go in and see it not knowing anything about it and to just enjoy the ride. A fantastic movie with a brilliant screenplay, shot composition and a cast that nail their characters so well that despite the move being subbed, every emotion and story turn is easily understood and beautifully delivered. One of the best movies I have seen in many a year. You won't stop talking about it afterwards!",1
241,Brilliantly depicts the class division in today’s society and how we subconsciously view others based on monetary worth.,1
242,A masterpiece that’s even better on second viewing. The score and editing in this movie is underrated and needs more recognition.,1
243,An amazing suspense thrilling dark comedy that left me in awe at the end. This film will stay with long after viewing.,1
244,"It is the best film I have ever seen, because it works with the raw truth, a true teaching for human beings to have more compassion for others and that greed does not get anyone anywhere",1
245,This is fantastic and it will never bore you Awesome movie.. you must watch,1
246,"Masterpiece is putting it lightly. This is the best movie of the last 10 years, if not the last 20. We're all parasites.",1
247,"Parasite is the best movie of 2019, it is a great black comedy and a social satire. This is a masterpiece from the master film-maker Bong Joon-Ho and the best to see in the world of cinema. It's violent but also gives out positive messages (15+), and also it has won many awards so far such as BEST PICTURE and BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY so I say it's a must to see and it's very great.",1
248,"This movie is just spectacular in every way possible, it's got some great camera work from start to finish. Also, the movie has got some brilliant chemistry with most of the characters in this movie. Finally, I'd say its probably one of the best movies I've ever watched before, I didn't get bored for a second throughout it.",1
249,What a great film! parasite is for sure one of the best movies i have ever seen! this movie had a fantastic/original story and an ending that i didn't see coming ! my score 100%,1
250,"“You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned. Look around you. Did you think these people made a plan to sleep in the sports hall with you? But here we are now, sleeping together on the floor. So, there's no need for a plan. You can't go wrong with no plans. We don't need to make a plan for anything. It doesn't matter what will happen next. Even if the country gets destroyed or sold out, nobody cares. Got it?” ",1
251,"Vamos a ver, sinceramente no me pareció para tanto en su momento, pero sí, es una buena película, eso no se lo puede quitar nadie.",1
252,"A fantastic showcase of the power of cinema, in a beautifully shot and edited film that uses these cinematic tools to move forward a gripping plot and a powerful message.",1
253,"Honestly, this movie is an argument for why people shouldn’t ignore foreign films. The story of class struggle and the difference between the rich and poor is timeless and very universal, the characters all feel like real people, and the movie is good at keeping up the suspense and drama without being melodramatic.Do make sure that if you watch this with subtitles that they are good subtitles that are large and are a colour that won’t blend in with backgrounds - I watch this as a PPV and the subtitles were these tiny white ones that disappeared into light coloured dogs, floors, and walls and this is a movie where you need to know what characters are saying.",1
254,"Groundbreaking and genre-defying, Parasite is undoubtedly a integral landmark in cinema history.",1
255,"An extremely surprising movie, impeccably made, with an original story and an unsettling atmosphere.",1
256,"So many moments of nuance, the embedding of the score is so subtle, the editing feels so effortless, and simply one of the best overall ensemble performances I've ever seen. Song Kang-ho and Choi Woo-sik stood out with how their fantastic acting added large depth to their characters, but at the end of the day, Lee Jung-eun stole the show entirely. The production design for me ranks among Anderson's The Grand Budapest hotel, and I believe this film may be as/more influential for everybody to the likes of The Godfather. The cinematography and lighting work feels so sharp, and the storyboards of Bong Jong-Ho are extremely precise. You can feel Bong's direction and the film feels entirely thought out and rehashed multiple times thinking from a filmmaker's perspective. The screenplay aaaaa. I can't praise this film enough. This film is too close to being ""perfect"", my only issue is that the third act, while it wraps up the film thematically and is one that has grown on me, feels a teensy tiny bit out of place.97/100",1
257,Very hard film with many different ways of thinking about other peoples in social,1
258,"10/10 One of the few ""Perfect"" movies ever made.Objectively, everything about ""Parasite"" is essentially flawless. Regardless of what some may think about this movie, it's hard to substantiate any sort of flaw or even a tiny nitpick with Bong Joon Ho's direction in this movie. He is without a doubt one of the most talented directors today and I think ""Parasite"" will go on to be his ""Magnum Opus""",1
259,"Bong Joon Ho's one of the best masterpiece of portraying social class division with twisting plots are nothing but incredible.The concept of the movie starts with showing  the  difference between upper class and lower class people lifestyle and their dependency. It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here.The first half of the film follows the family living at a semi basement apartment in poor locality. After the son is given an opportunity by his friend to teach as a English Tutor in rich family and came to realise that although he is earning more , his family is getting what they deserve. As they are not as bright as the son , so son decides to make a plan to employ their family in that house where he teaches. Sooner they become wealthy as they all working in different positions in the same house.The first half may look flat and give some impression of the base of movie .But when it comes to the second half there is a major plot twisting. It clears the display of showing the struggle of poor within the unjust society and hence this sudden joyful life comes into tragedy. This cast members brilliantly performed their role. The cinematography and background score of  make the audience more focused!Its funny , thrilling, emotional and moral based script makes it a masterpiece ! No doubt, it is one of my favourite movie and I am strongly recommend it to watch ( although it is an S.Korean movie ).",1
260,"Parasite touches on the often big wealth gap in countries, specifically South Korea. I suggest when you watch this you watch with no judgement and have empathy it truly shows a different side of South Korea that I don’t think outside consumers have seen. Not to mention, the filming and angles are great!",1
261,"Absolutely magnificent movie. This is the latest movie from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho,",1
262,It's easy to understand why this movie is considered such a masterpiece. My only complaint would be that I wish it was a little bit scarier. But other than that I found the story to be really compelling and had very complex and numerous themes. The artistry required to discuss these messages and still not beat you over the head with them is just incredible. This is the kind of movie that will stick with you long after you watch it. I know I could spend hours just watching analysis video and interviews with the director. This is definitely a must see.,1
263,"Worth the hype that surrounded it. The contrast, the acting, the absolute top notch screenplay, the twists and the end all are frickin amazing. 9.75 Thought provoking. Will leave you in a contemplative state and that's how powerful this piece of cinema is. Park So-dam is so damn cute.",1
264,"Definitely the best movie I have seen within the entirety of my life. So much in 2 hours, your brain can barely contain it all! Amazing movie!",1
266,"Parasite is about as close to 'perfection' that you can get. The movie successfully blends multiple genres and is a masterpiece of cinematography. The director is constantly and subtly feeding you important information in cool and interesting ways, which makes the eventual twists and turns feel natural and earned.The less you know about this movie before watching; the better. It's easily one of the best films I've ever seen.",1
267,"""Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films"" - Bong Joon Ho. Every piece of this genre bending film is meticulously and masterfully crafted. I am absolutely blown away. There's a quality about certain films where, from the first scene, you can tell there's one strong artistic vision behind it. And in film, this is, of course, called direction. The direction behind Parasite is undoubtedly what made it my new favorite film of 2019. Breaking down the qualities of this film in order of appearance, Parasite is shot with real personality. A steady and practiced hand behind the camera adds one extra layer of emotion to every scene, almost treating the frame as if its the vision of an intangible observer. Focus tracks through this film in that manner with absolute precision and in doing so creates an urgency where there otherwise might not have been. The score of Parasite has a John Williams (almost Home Alone) style at its core with layers thrown on top of it to address the actions in each plot point nearly beat for beat. This is more challenging than it sounds due to the winding and weaving plot the film. I won't write much on the plot as it's best experienced with no preconceptions, but I will say that if you're a plot guesser when you watch movies, you are SOL with this one. On top of all of this, the performances rise to the same level of expertise. The actor playing each character undeniably brings their roles' multi-faceted natures to light over the course of the runtime. The script is the foundation for this, but you can really feel the personality of the direction of this film shining through every performance. This is my new favorite film of 2019 and m pick for best picture in a stacked year. Loved this one.",1
268,A benchmark I will measure future films with. The most epic masterpiece I've ever seen.,1
269,This movie didn't disappoint! Everything felt original and it took a disturbing twist towards the end. The theme of the movie was clear from the get go! Overall great movie and I would watch again!,1
270,"Amazing. This movie is so many genres at the same time. Drama, thriller, comedy.",1
271,"What begins as a comedic social satire soon descends into sharp absurdism depicting the apathetic and degrading treatment of the poor by the economic elite. The escalation of violence is understandable once it is made apparent just how apathetic the house owners are to those dying right in front of them... With the rich father being more disgusted by the smell than the carnage itself. It is a very wonderfully crafted depiction.While the caretaking family does commit fraud, their actions are simply to survive and create a ladder that has been otherwise made inaccessible... Although they too themselves are not immune to the allure of the niceties of luxury... Ultimately a night of reckless greed inadvertently leads to their own demise.The ending is icing on the cake and highlights the futile struggle of those born at the bottom to ever hope to own what is held carelessly by the top.

Also, it's no use analyzing it from a political or a social persperctive beacuse that's not what this movie is supposed to say. It's just about a HUMAN BEING itself, and this is what makes PARASITE a brilliant masterpiece and what makes a difference from previous films. Adding a bit of exaggeration, PARASITE is totally a new genre itself.Last but not least, IT'S HUGE FUN!! ",1
