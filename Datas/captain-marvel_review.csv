0,"They made a character with no real weakness who spends the entire movie as an expressionless hero with no charisma.  I was so bored during this movie.  By the time the pace FINALLY picked back up near the end, it was too little too late.   This entirely forgettable entry into this massive film franchise is completely skippable.  You won't need to see this to understand what's going on in Endgame.  Yes, there will be this new Captain Marvel character in Endgame, but all you really need to know is that she existed back in the 90's and finds her way back to the action ""in the nick of time"" once Endgame rolls around.  One thing to note:  Your experience of the MCU as a whole may be lessened if you see this movie or accept this movie as canon.  They literally retconned Captain Marvel as the BEGINNING of the Avengers, as well as the battle for control of a certain macguffin that was central to phase 1 marvel's climax.  They also introduce a plotline where there's little reason for the Kree to have largely ignored Earth all this time since the 90's.  This is a pretty big plothole.How does this rank compared to the rest of the MCU?  It's right at the bottom; near but below Thor the Dark World and Iron Man 2. If Thor 2 and Iron Man 2 are both 2/5 stars, this one is 1.5/5 stars.",0
1,"I wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately it suffers from a poor script, lackluster action and a badly cast leading lady.The positives:-Nick Fury is great -  I hope one day we get a proper shield movieGoose the cat has some very good scenesThe negatives:-Badly cast lead - Emily Blunt should have got the rolePoor fight scenesPoor villainsThe movie feels very much like a phase one film, ten years to late and out of place among the impressive changes Disney has made to the recent incarnations. If Captain Marvel is to be the face of the Marvel franchise then urgent work must be taken to correct course - recast if necessary and for the love of god seek advice from Patty Jenkins and the wonder women team.",0
2,"Boooring.  The lead actor, Brie Larson is a terrible, uncharismatic super-hero.  This is actually the first female superhero, from Marvel that I would prefer to never see again.",0
3,Boring and flat movie that is tainted by the hateful political sentiments from Brie Larson.,0
4,"I was excited and emotional during WW and I came out of that cinema looking forward to Captain Marvel. I am a woman who grew up with Monica Rambeau, this movie disappointed me. Brie Larson was monotonous, she was out shined by her co stars notably Samuel and Ben. I don't understand the ""Girl Power"" narrative they tried to shove and I'm female. Especially the ""I'm Just A Girl"" playing in the back during the fight I wanted to hide under my seat because I was cringing. It lacks so much of the emotional context that WW had. Marvel and Disney can do better.",0
5,"I'm really worried about Endgame after watching this filmJust watched this film this morning and i really regret watching this in theatre.Let's start with good things :- First opening action scene is really good- Nick Fury was good and funny- Sounds and visuals are good obviously coming from MarvelAaand everything else just falls flat to the ground i think Brie Larson here is terribly miscast she is really good in a slow dramatic movies but here it just doesn't work always stone faced even the smiles seemed very fake and cringe , director of this movie tried so hard to push this female power feminist ideas that she forgot to make a good movie in the first place.The weirdest scene is when she all of a sudden starts flying out of nowhere and she is not even excited or surprised it felt so weird , also they overpowered her so much to the point where it seemed unrealistic to me that this irrelevant character is stronger than thor or hulk and all this came from a jet engine blast too what a joke.Overall very disappointed in this film i would give 2 out of 10 to this film and for the sake of Nick Fury i give 3 i really hope Endgame is better than this .",0
7,"First, this is a review of the movie itself. I know there has been discussion outside regarding cast comments, and sincerely, I just went into the movie and forgot about those things, as what matters for me is the film itself, and its own merits.  I am a big fan of the comics and the MCU, and so although I wasn't familiar with this character, I was looking forward to her introduction and understanding how this will impact the MCU.  I also know that having a very overpowering character, like Superman, is harder to relate to, so I went into the movie already willing to give them some slack, but hoping they could pull it off and make an awesome movie.Unfortunately, for many reasons, the movie is simply bad.  And yet, it had many things in it that show it could have been much better, so maybe there is hope for a sequel in the future, and are definitely things that can be changed.  Let me explain.  I think the easiest way to describe how I felt during the movie was that I cringed a lot.First, I had heard that the main Actress Brie Larson was a really good actress.  I can't comment on that as this is the only movie I saw with her, and I definitely want to see other of her works now so I can get a better opinion.  But in this movie, her character was portrayed in a very abnoxious manner in most of the film (you know when a person can't be nice or kind to anyone, but just wants to act like a know-it-all jerk?).  I don't know whose decision this was, maybe she was asked to portray it this way.  There are though some better moments, in particular in the ship with Fury, and with her best friend's child, that she is more likable.  I just wish we had seen more of that.  I think the tone for her came off unnecessarily cold and again, the way I felt was that it was just being abnoxious.  Now, I think this is something that she and they can change going forward, but it did not help when they are introducing us to a new character.  This is even worse taking into consideration that they really need audiences to like her, given how difficult it is to connect with such an overpowered character, as is Captain Marvel's case.  So, her acting was way off, and I don't know why, and I don't want to put in question her capacity, hence my wanting to see other works from her.Anyway, moving on.  The second most impactful problem is the production and editing.  The movie is a long string of moments that should be of either emotion or great action, but that fall flat.  I really feel they wanted those moments to be really grand and epic, and I think they actually could have been, but they just felt rushed and unearned, which actually turned them into really cringy.  And this is the problem for me, I think that Captain Marvel's story was actually all there, there were lots of good pieces, which were presented, but the way they brought this together, the timing and presentation was beautiful visually, but was just rushed and felt really off for me, personally.  So I really feel that it wasn't a lack of compelling story or character motivation, just the way the final cut flows.  Those emotional moments, and the action, they were lacking either some more development, or not to be rushed or so obvious.  The Skrulls (and Ben Mendelsohn) were great, it was always nice to have Fury and Coulson (I'm a big fan of the Agents of Shield, Coulson is such a charismatic character).  Ok, having been unbiased about the movie, I do need to address honestly the Feminism question.  I am a person who really enjoys that there are movie with strong female leads, with great stories to tell.  And I think Marvel has a lot of potential they still have not taken advantage in terms of female characters to tell more stories about (I mean, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow have been great until now, and I would love to hear more of their stories, and have them lead their own films, i think they deserve more attention.  And the actresses have done great!).I know that some of the directors and cast were open about the feminism part. I have no problem with that.  I just feel that it was cringy to force Director Fury to act dumb in some situations, just to give Captain Marvel an air of ""gotcha"", hey, let me lead you.  That is just not necessary. I think audiences deserve much better.  I loved Alita, which had a great female character and was an awesome movie.  In this movie, I felt they always had to prove that Captain Marvel was better than the men around her, and sincerely, it was cringy. The movie is bad, because Brie Larson's acting is bad, and the production was way off.But, I think those are two things that they can turn around I and sincerely hope they do, and if they do, I will  enjoy watching what they do in a sequel. Ah, did I mention I loved what they did with the Skrulls? Well done on that point!  And yes, that cat it is cool!",0
8,"I watched it last night (luckily my theater reward system gave me a free ticket for a movie so no wasted money). Right from the get go, the initial scenes didn't really serve to draw me in. Much of the movie I spent wondering what was the point of X scene or Y scene etc. Sadly, I was also spending time watching the time to see if the movie was near its end. **POTENTIAL SPOILERS INC** The de-aging of Coulson and Sam L Jackson was pretty bad in my opinion. It wasn't good enough to sell it and in various scenes including Sam Jackson's action scene it just didn't look right. Brie Larson's fighter pilot friend was actually pretty good as I got a lot of her emotions and how she felt when she lost her friend (Brie), and her connection with her kid was great as well. Compare that to Brie's emotions/acting I was honestly unimpressed. For an Oscar winner she wasn't able to really sell me her character or convince me to care about her. In many scenes when she tried to crack jokes or have snarky comments it came off forced and unlike her (maybe a ""I'm trying to be the new RDJ""). I'm all for powerful superheroes but in this entire movie she made short work of all her enemies without really much of a struggle at all and at the end Jude Law versus her was anti-climatic. I think MCU really had a misstep on this one and one of their biggest mistakes was trying to shoehorn a superhero right before endgame and the last mistake was casting Brie as Captain Marvel, she doesn't really fit the character. I would say you could easily tell she was an actress trying to play a superhero which didn't work at all. I would recommend skipping this one and going straight to EndGame. You can literally read spoilers online and save yourself 2+ hours and a movie ticket.",0
9,"It almost makes me angry to the point of wanting to dismantle my Captain Marvel poster....they hyped this movie up in articles, commercials , etc. but it barely lives up to the hype...its like they have something they were really trying to prove when they made this movie....and sadly to say it has already been proven in over 1,000+ movies.",0
10,"I went into this film with such high expectations given that it's the final MCU film before the highly anticipated Avengers:Endgame, and the huge push it got from Avengers: Infinity War post credits scene, in addition to all the official news that suggested Captain Marvel is going to be the face of the MCU and arguably its most powerful character. You might say i'm not being fair for holding an origin movie to that tremendously high standard, well, for the reasons i listed above, this isn't your Captain America: The First Avenger or your Thor origin film, it's a completely different ball game. We were told that this character is a game changer therefore, I expect no less.I thought the movie was really disappointing in every way imaginable, it was such a let down! Nothing worked for me here, the writing was bad for the most part (except the major plot twist in the movie), the lead character's performance was stoic, bland and monotonic that I never felt sold. Carol Danvers lacked depth, she had no heart or let me say; her heart wasn't in it. Samuel L Jackson was acting out of character, which really turned me off, that is NOT the Nick Fury we know from the MCU, had it been a different character I would have probably liked it, but not Nick.There wasn't enough of the remaining cast to say anything about them (apart from Ben Mendelsohn's Talos perhaps the only highlight of this film, besides the plot twist, of course).The pacing in the first half was awfully slow, and the plot wasn't all that fresh, it was originally supposed to focus on Carlo Danvers trying to find herself and her re-discover her past, but they show none of that. All they show is few, quick random flashbacks here and there.I'm absolutely disappointed of how the ""new face of the MCU"" turned out to be.",0
11,"Poorly executed with misscasted main protagonist, riddled with feminist propaganda.",0
12,Writing is poor. Acting is passable. Pacing seemed off and the overall movie is lacking in any kind of joy. Main actress must have graduated from the Kristen Stewart school of acting because she is expressionless through most of the movie.,0
13,"Marvel really screwed up this time. The monolithic vibe exuded by the character was almost unbearable. If this is the most powerful character in the MCU and if she is going to play a huge role in defeating Thanos, then I won't be seeing Endgame either.",0
14,"I wasn't planning on seeing the movie after all the trailers and the director saying its a femimist film, but went and saw it after I lost a bid. It was so boring that my friend left the theatre and left me in the movie...Spoiler free:1-The acting is very very bland and bad Brie Larson doesn't know what emotion to emot, it was so bad that I really didn't feel any scene worst yet I didn't know what to feel as she was always smirking even when the situation is serious and doesnt call for it. although some supporting actors like Samuel L. Jackson was okayish and kindda enjoyable giving that the script was bad as hell.2-The story is unfocused and so convoluted the main villian is bland and weak which make the final showdown so underwhelming,the story is also filled with plot holes and unnecessary drama.3-The fighitng scenes are one of the worst I ever seen and thats a dissaster specially when your movie is an action flick.4-The script is pure sh#!t trying waaaay to hard to sound serious at the same time trying to be funny and failing in booth.5-The direction and editing ....omg. Lets just say no one is winning any Oscar any time soon.6-The visual effects and designs were soo generic that you would never know what movie it is seeing them without context (see Alita for reference on good visual effects and character designs)Spoiler:Nick fury lost his eye because a cat scratched it......if thats not destroying a character legacy I don't know what is.....",0
15,"Other than Samuel L. Jackson, this movie has nothing good to offer. So sad for Endgame...Wish they brought back entertainment without pointless politics.",0
16,"Bad lead actress, bad SJW garbage, spits at their main demographic. honestly you have to be a idiot to do this",0
17,I would have rather had explosive diarrhea then watch this movie again. It was really boring and felt like it was nothing but bad acting from Brie. I feel as though they could have cast just about any other female lead and it would have been better. The plot was pretty predictable as well,0
18,"I'll start off by saying this movie didn't suck because the main character was a woman, it sucked because the writers made a bad script & the main character was a woman with no real-world character, therefore, wasn't able to emote or portray a likable hero at all. Saw an early copy of this movie, I refused to support it & I must say this movie was blatant disrespect to comic book fans, but not only comic book fans, but moviegoers alike. The story was below subpar, the acting by the main character was a flat as a tumbled souffle. The dialog, effects and set up just all felt like an afterthought to the boosting of a female lead. Seems like the movie was rushed & not planned or thought out at all.",0
19,"Captain Marvel is a one dimensional character portrayed as the heroine of feminism.  When a character embodies the self worth of a whole group, the character most be infallible, all powerful as to not offend said group.  This leads to a very boring movie!  Say your money and pass on this one",0
20,"What in God's name happened!? I was totally looking forward to this...I'm not even sure what I just watched. This was supposed to be a solid entry. The script is horrible! Dude, no one should've cleared this through Marvel and Disney.",0
21,I went into this this movie expecting something aggressively average... I was disappointed. I'll give this movie a 3.5 and a prayer that this isn't a death knell to the MCU.,0
22,"By far one of the most boring marvel movies, really bad performance from Brie Larson without any emotion .Together with the feminist propaganda makes this movie one of the worst marvel movies ever.",0
23,Really excellent Stan Lee cameo but not much else. Brie Larson is utterly bland in the role. No real setup for Endgame.,0
24,"I'm giving a 1 just for the cat. The main character was a bland Mary Sue, the CG was **** the dialogues cringy... And I'm not even talking about the feminist agenda pandering.",0
25,"A pretty boring and bland movie, Brie Larson was misscast, the feminist tone forced on certain parts of the movie were unnecessary and in your face. Wonder Woman and Black Panther did a way better job at elevating their target values. I hope this character doesn't ruin the culmination of this cinematic universe in Avengers Endgame.",0
26,"So after seeing this movie, I'm really concerned. Why? Because despite having unlimited ressources, the movie was bad. Like really. God I hope Disney doesn't start butchering the Marvel Universe like they did with Star Wars. WTH is going on at Disney???",0
27,"Somewhat embarrassed that I've actually enjoyed Marvel movies up until now. There is nothing redeeming about this movie, every aspect of it is utter garbage, the centerpiece of it Craptain Marvel, the single most uninteresting character I have ever seen presented on a big screen. There is nothing likeable about the character or how she's portrayed. Don't believe the shills praising this trash. Don't waste your money on this.",0
28,"What a mess of a movie, I don't even know where to start. Jackson and the cat were great, Larson was just a bad casting call or very poorly directed. CGI was decent, but for the MCU it was a bit on the lame side. I did not find the movie over politicized and the boycott stuff was just non-sense. BUT, if like me, you wanted to see this to not miss anything before ENDGAME, save your money and find the post-credit scene online.  That's all you need to know for ENDGAME.  Further, if you're a fan of the comics, there is a lot in this movie to piss off purist.  Hint: Fury's eye.  Over all a very uninspired, boring filler of a movie.  The cat was cool, tho...",0
29,"This is the worst of the MCU so far. A number of VERY boring scenes. Every time there was something which could be fun and exciting, you're left questioning nonsensical writing/direction or terrible delivery. This maybe shouldn't be too surprising considering the lack of relevant experience among writers/directors or Brie Larson herself. Strange choices for such a seemingly important installment and it shows very plainly throughout.",0
30,Why the hell Marvel made this movie? so uninspiring and boring!!  Brie Larson's acting remind me of The last air bender. They should have developed a strong story before making this movie. Not a joy ride for me before Avenger End game..,0
31,Highly disrespectful to the source material and a blatant attempt to shove this character down people's throats.CM is a deus ex machina and watches like a fanfic.,0
32,"Disappointing movie to put it generously... I´m a huge MCU fan and it´s so obvious Kevin Fegie came out with the idea of this overpowered character only to overshadow Wonder Woman; but he failed. As a fan I only wanted a Scarlet Witch solo movie cuz Captain Marvel even in the comics is pretentious, unlikable.",0
33,"This movie was a chore to even sit through. The few good moments were ruined by the 1 hour wait for ANYTHING INTRESTING to happen. My kid fell asleep half way in, then cried thinking they weren't going to get to see a movie today. Had to spend $50+ in total, 6 Tickets (3 for each movie) and more drinks, to see How To Train Your Dragon.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!! SAVE YOURSELVES!",0
35,"Not originality. Boring plot, characters and so on. Aqua man was more entertaining.",0
36,The good things I can say about this movie start and end with Samuel L Jackson. Other than that the film is aggressively mediocre and Brie Larson is not believable as the next face of the MCU. Would rather have seen a Scarlet Witch movie.,0
37,"Nothing but a presentation character movie made for that purpose, but with lack of creativity. No surprises, except for the post credit scenes. The hype for Carol Danvers to be the most powerful character in MCU is not justified/answered due Larson´s performance. Unfortunately, it´s not a good MCU movie as we´ve all been expecting.",0
38,"The cat steals the show, but then ruins it by permanently injuring a long term fan favorite character.  I am concerned that the movie doesn't explain how Danvers gets her powers.  She just sort of has the powers after a bit, it never really gets explained.",0
39,"I went into this film with low expectations, based on the awful marketing. But I was actually decently entertained during the first and second acts. As soon as the ""I'm a girl"" fight scene started in act three though, I literally facepalmed. The movie went right off the cliff from there.I blame three factors for the way the movie turned out.First, Brie was wrong for the role. She's supposed to be playing a character who has trouble controlling her emotions, but at no time during the movie do we see her lose control. She only oscillates between placid and haughty. At least she smiles sometimes, and cracks jokes, which is something we really didn't see in the trailer. But she never disappears into her character in the way that Jackson, Mendelsohn, or especially Lashana Lynch do.Second, this film version of Captain Marvel is flawed in her characterization. I actually like a few of the recent comic versions of her, but the character's flaws in those are BOTH her lack of emotional control and her over-confidence. The lack of emotional control never really appears, and while the over-confidence is in this film in spades, Captain Marvel never once pays a price for it. Instead it's treated like a virtue. That's not how heroes act.In fact, there are at least 3 times that she is self-centered to the point of being completely unlikeable. During one key scene she fist-blasts someone who's not actually a physical threat (just put down his weapon), but who is just annoying her with what he says. That's not what heroes do.Third, the script is weak. Captain Marvel can beam-punch-fly her way right through thickly armored alien battle-cruisers, but nobody else that she (or anyone else) zaps seems to have much trouble getting up afterward. Nick Fury is relegated to a comic side-kick role that demeans the character. The cat steals the show. The main twist reminds me way too much of ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"". The aliens who've never been to earth know what ""Jazz Hands"" are.And the jokes... My theater was 3/4 full, and the whole audience was enjoying the humor for about the first half of the film. But as we entered that third act, Captain Marvel had become so unlikeable, and the humor was so misplaced, that only two people up front were still laughing.And when we finally see Captain Marvel respond to Fury's pager? What would you expect her emotional state to be? Worry? Sorrow, maybe? Devastated? Nope. She's full on angry-face in a room full of traumatized avengers. The contrast between her and them could not have been more unbecoming, and I am NOT looking forward to whatever selfish part she plays in End Game as a result.",0
40,"The movie is boring and mundane. Using the same old formula. No character arch or growth for Captain Marvel. If you miss this movie, you won't be missing anything at all.",0
41,"Long, boring, pointless and Brie Larson was miscast. A lot of potential but disappointing",0
42,"This movie beats all my expectations in cringe, stupidity and boredom. LOL. Complete garbage. Fury losing his eye by a cat was the icing on the cake. Im not a white dude btw.",0
43,Never a good idea to force an agenda with a movie. Especially in this genre. Especially when the character representing this agenda is going to front line the whole franchise for the foreseeable future. And especially when the lead is such a toxic feminist.,0
44,"Fell asleep in the movie, though I do remember a talking plank and a funny cat. Worst Marvel movie ever, wonder how they will fix endgame. I support replacing her with the concept of Scarlet Witch learning her full powers and kicking Thanos ass,'she has enough reason to hate hate him, has lost everything, and that can unlock her potential. Ps see ""House of M"" where she suffered a mental breakdown and altered the fabric of reality, creating a whole new universe and altering everyones memory of the prior one. Awesome story . The girl is truly supper bad ass and OP when allowed to reach potential.",0
45,"One of the most boring marvel movies, bad performance from Brie Larson without any emotion . Together with the feminist propaganda makes this movie one of the worst marvel movies ever",0
46,Watched it today with my friends and it was relly underwhelming experience. The main acress acting is really bad throughout whole movie. First act of the movie was kind of OK thanks to Samuel L. Jackson performance but the second act and ending is just disappointing. The whole permise of another forced origin feels uninspired and boring. Don't waste your money on tickets.,0
47,"A mediocre Marvel movie at best, in line with the worst of the Thor movies.  I think Brie Larson wasn't the best lead for this type of film as I think she is better in drama's.  The film started reasonably well but got boring towards the middle and fell apart at the end.  The fight scenes were choppy and the climactic battle was obscured by the mist so it was difficult to see what was going on.  The plot was by the numbers with no surprises.  On a more positive note though the cat was great!  A message to Marvel, if you want to do an interesting female character movie, then please try Black Widow (although she is probably not powerful enough for you but she is a damn sight more interesting character) or possibly Scarlet Witch if you must have a more powerful hero to hang your hat on.",0
48,"Marvel's worse film to date. Larson is merely copying RDJ's Tony Stark but without his flaws (as that would enrage the SJWs) and appeal. The de-aging tech was a bad idea for an entire film as it makes Jackson and Gregg look like wax models. The first 30 mins drag like hell and remind me of the pointless scenes in Green Lantern. The film is good in the middle as we find out more about Carol but is then let down by the biggest Mary Sue performance ever in the final act. Nothing even phases her which is horrendous character development. I feel that the writers and directors were thinking along the lines of John Wick or Die Hard in respect to a hero whom cannot be stopped and will persevere until they win, which is fine, but they still struggle at times, none of which was present in Captain Marvel. The feminist rhetoric was even more cringy than the SJW dialogue in Black Panther but at least he was likable and quite relatable (to say he's a king). Decent film all round but as a MCU mega fan who has watched every film on release and follow this franchise more than most, I find it to be a weak entry and the very worst origin film from the MCU. Oh and the Nick Fury eye scenario is the biggest kick in the teeth ever. They could have done literately anything to acknowledge that Easter egg but they did THAT. Fury, the badass MFer, lost his eye like that...WTFDisney watched as Star Wars and Ghostbusters was destroyed by their disastrous marketing and attack on fans but for some reason Disney thought they would give it a go anyway?!?!?! Safe to say this all panned out as I thought so if we could get back to the business of telling great stories and not setting agendas that would be greeeeaaat.",0
49,The acting is not bad and the chemistry between fury and carol is good but other than that the movie is a total bore even the action scenes.Also the srcipt is stupid.,0
50,The beginning of the movie was all over the place no real focus.  She didn't have a hero arc to learn her powers and someone you can root for.  She was just given her powers at peek performance instead of earning them.  On top of that there wasn't even a funny part in the movie; maybe they need to add a laugh track to tell us when a joke is funny because no one was laughing during the movie I saw.,0
51,Really boring movie with major plot holes and uninteresting characters.  Larson shows very little emotional range.,0
52,"Captain Marvel is the real villain of this movie. In the course of the film, she turns from a character who is trying to learn to control her own strength, into a character who do what she wants without paying attention to others. This is by definition a villain, and if in future projects she would be a villain, then I don’t have problems with it. But we all know how she is positioned in the universe. For now she is nobody without the suit.The script is very ragged, and in my opinion it would be better to make a film fully devoted to 6 years in Starforce. After the movie I can't even remember the names of the Starforce, and really want more of them. The story is the weakest thing in the film, and the avengers will have to work very hard to fix this character.Brie Larson is fine. Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, the cat and the other support cast are great, but there is too little to do for them in this movie.",0
53,"this is just all around bad, ridiculous and boring movie. Captain Marvel was never an interesting character in a first place and theres a good reason why marvel keep rebooting hers comics. This is without any doubts worst MCU movie so far and its TLJ level bad. Story, characters, dialogues, fight scenes it all looked more like pre-MCU superhero movies like fantastic four, ghost rider or catwoman (or DCEU standard). Disney probably thought that with the right agenda pushed into movie they can get away with below average product... well no BTW: go to see Alita if you want amazing female character played by amazing cool actress",0
54,"Saw it on Thursday night with low expectations, hoping to be pleasantly surprised.  Sadly, I was not.  Boring plot, bad acting, forgettable villains, and lackluster action scenes.  Waste of time and money.  Most egregiously, the movie somehow managed to make me less excited about the upcoming Avengers: Endgame.  There is only one good character in this movie -- the cat.",0
55,Breeeee Larson is a misfit for this character. But the Cat.... the cat was fine.,0
57,"My girlfriend wanted to see this for her birthday. We were both disappointed at the end.. I'm not sure if they wanted Captain marvel(Brie Larson) to be stoic and emotionless in her portrayal of Carol Danvers but it didn't work for me. The cenimatics were great and the movie had it's moments (if you can make it to the end). We both just felt let down as we were walking out of the theater, especially after the watching the gem of a film that was Alita battle angel.",0
58,"Brie Larson's performance was terrible. She sounded like a spoiled teenage girl when delivering most of her lines. The movie doesn't give us a background story about the skrulls, only that they are shapeshifters! The soundtracks were terrible and not fitting with the superhero theme at all! If Marvel had hired a more talented actress and cared more about the story rather than forcing the feminist theme, the movie would have been much better!",0
59,"Another MCU movie that is generic and cookie-cutterIsn't the ""trailblazer"" the media keeps pretending it is considering DC had a solo female superhero movie back in the 80s with Supergirl, and it only took the DCEU's second solo film for Wonder Woman. I love how there is this big cry from the media, who totally aren't biased you guys (sarcasm) that if you don't love this movie, and if you don't go see this movie, than you are a woman hating sexist.My answer to that is what does it make the media since they dumped all over Alita Battle Angel? Which was a much better movie and featured a lead who doesn't despise white men?Don't go see this movie.It's just not worth the price of admission. I luckily didn't have to pay out of my pocket because I got dragged last night to the Thursday screenings by my brother and his friend and my brother paid for mine because he wanted to get me out of the house since I've been sick all week.The story is generic. Brie Larson's acting is atrocious, the villains have the make-up level of network television, the cat isn't the show stealing event the media keeps pretending it is.Honestly there is no reason to trust the critics anymore. Syfy Wire admitted on a Podcast recently that they and everyone else will look the other way and throw softballs at certain movies to keep getting access to early screenings and red carpet events. So you can't trust the word of of a critic as far as you can throw them.I almost don't even want to see Avengers: Endgame knowing that she will be the center of attention in it, knowing she'll most likely easily beat Thanos and make the rest of the cast we've grown to know over the course of a decade seem irrelevant. 1/10 and that's being generous",0
60,"This movie falls completely flat to the ground as just another mediocre superheroes movie, but with a very predictable plot and a very forgettable lead actor. Brie Larson is not my favourite actor or person, but here she seems to be even miscast, and she really doesn't deliver in the lead role.",0
61,"Captain Marvel feels to me the same way as Solo: Star Wars Story - the movie that noone wanted and noone needed. Instead of Black Widow or Scarlett Witch films, Marvel decided to introduce a character that had 9 (nine) reboots of its comic, and market it as The Strongest and the new lead, replacing the Iron Man in the future. I don't know where to start to explain how miscast and misplaced that is.Long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away Marvel was at its lowest, having sold many of its characters to survive, and had to use a b-rate Iron Man for its movie, which was an immense success due to charisma and carrying of Robert Downey Jr, character progression and struggle through movie, character flaws, weaknesses and humour.This time Marvel is at its peak, ready to present the culmination of a decade-long development of franchise, having a huge roster of popular and well presented characters.What would be the worst possible things for Marvel to do in current situation? Lets's see:- present an unpopular provocative character out of nowhere- market it as the strongest, as if being the strongest is what makes characters likable and popular- devalue all the decade-long popular and developed cast by claiming that the new character will succeed where they all failed- allow the lead actor to make provocative devisive speeches on public time and time again- make a totally mediocre movie for a character that is supposed to be central in their culmination final movieThat's the literal description of Captain Marvel, and while I was watching Brie Larson's unphased unchanging bored face for two hours straight, I could not find any reason in my mind why Marvel did this at this time. All I felt after the end credits was a stunning emptiness inside.It's not a bad movie, though the action scenes were very choppy and I can't remember the soundtrack at all. But for a Marvel movie that leads to Endgame, this is a disaster, thus - 1/10 from me, from the bottom of my heart and soul.",0
62,"TL;DR I was starting to like Captain Marvel, even with Larson's bad performance, and then the third act made her a Mary Sue and ruined everything for me.I disagree with people who describe this movie as meh, mainly because this movie made me sad. There is just so much wasted potential as it is obvious that the premise itself has the works of a good story in between, but one which the movie fails to deliver.The Story: The premise is very interesting but the main reason this movie doesn't work is the lack of tension. There is never a moment where you actually feel concerned for the well-being of the main character, and very few moments where you are concerned for the supporting characters. And even then, the tension is never allowed to build but is quickly dispelled. This is especially problematic here because this movie takes place in the past. If you remember how tensionless the action scenes with Legolas were in the Hobbit because Legolas is alive and well in LoTR, you know what I mean.The script is poorly written which causes a lot of threads not sufficiently explored (i.e. the Kree-Skrull conflict, the nature of Danver's powers....)You can pinpoint exactly where the movie kind off falls apart, which is the beginning of the third act. That's where Captain Marvel becomes... well a Mary Sue basically since she's infinitely powerful and has no apparent weakness. at this point you are just waiting for the movie to end because there are no stakes at this point really.The Direction: To cut it short; bad direction. The movie doesn't have a distinct visual style, let alone one conducive of a particular mood. The line delivery of multiple actors are generally bad to the point that in some scenes I'd actually laugh and wonder how do these scenes made it into the final cut and who thought it was a good idea. The flash backs are in many cases not very well intertwined with the main timeline. The pacing however is OK.The Acting: Virtually everyone outperfroms Brie Larson in performance (Except Mar Vell), which gets distracting very early on. Larson's performance is awkward, bland, emotionless and uninspired. In fact I can't remember how many times her terrible performance turned me off while I was starting to care about Captian Marvel and her conflict.Action and special effects: Action is pretty O.K, special effects are very good.",0
63,"Boring movie, even goose the cat wasn't in it as much as i expected. Brie larson is wooden in the role as well and it's definitely one of the weakest MCU movies. She just lacks charisma compared to say robert downey jnr. I'm a bit worried about future avengers movies now, considering she's going to be a big part of them.",0
64,"This is a poor choice for MCU, i think She Hulk is more loved in the comic world than MS Marvel, Brie Larson just does not cut the part, Nick Fury the leader of the howling commandoes is the one liner side kick, this alone is embarrassing,,dont these writers and directors even read comics before making a movie??",0
66,This is the most boring movie of the MCU that I ever seen. Brie larson needs to be  recast,0
67,"A ""meh"" movie. Normally I would rate a movie like this a 5/10, but I am rating it lower for being an unnecessary cash grab before the release of the final Avengers movie. Marvel should have released this after Avengers Endgame. It is hard to care about any new characters when the ones we already know are in peril. The existence of Captain Marvel makes the events of the prior movies seem less important. You have to wonder where this character was when the Guardians of the Galaxy or Avengers needed help. Why did Nick Fury not care enough about the Earth in the prior movies that he did not call her for help? This movie creates too many plot holes in the Marvel universe.",0
68,"Bland, not fun, no ass, nick fury retcon made it a zero. Just another generic cookie cutter superhero movie pce",0
69,This movie is not fun and I'm not gonna watch it a second time for sure. My expectations were not really high and it matched them. Brie Larson plays a unrefreshingly pretentious Carol Danvers.,0
70,"Mediocre at best. It is a typical Mary-Sue type superhero action movie, with a main character that is 1-dimensional, posses no clear motives, drives, ambitions, fear, allegiences, etc.   In short, in point in the movie do you feel any connection with the main character. You expect in a hero moveie, for the hero to be battling an inner demon, to be fighting an inner struggle that is mirrored in a battle with some super villain. Think back to any great superhero movie. There is a climactic journey to fight some big baddie that goes hand in hand with an inner struggle of the hero coming to grips with their shortcomings, weakness, faults, past, etc.Captain Marvel lack all of the above, just a character that hits stuff and people, sometimes in a visually exciting fashion.  If i knew how bad it was, I would have given it a miss",0
71,"For me this movie was poor. I also think now in the MCU is too late a time to introduce a new character, especially and OP and political character. Plus non-existent story arc and generally cliche plot all contribute to a poor movie",0
72,"I was really disappointed.  I know Larson can act but the direction for her in this movie made her a robot person or something.  I was honestly bored in parts and it was like an hour in before I really started connecting with it.  I think it's worse than Ironman 2 but better than the second Thor, so basically almost the worst of the MCU.I don't really mind Mary Sues, but I am not really interested in seeing Endgame now.  This movie made me think that Captain Marvel will just fly in and knock out Thanos, while the others we have spent 10 years getting to know will just stand around.",0
73,Terrible movie very boring acting was super bad. Dont waste your money here.,0
74,"This film is a serious letdown of the MCU. It is the worst MCU movie to date. The pacing is poor, the story is too simple and Captain Marvel's background story isn't explored enough. The only 2 good things about this movie is that it is before Avengers Endgame and the jokes. I still can't believe that this film could be so bad and even worse than Spider-Man: Homecoming.",0
75,"Wow, I chose to ignore all the hate and went to see it as soon as I could as I have watched all the MCU movies. But, again, wow. There's just so little to it. Not even mediocre, just boring. Wish I could get that hour and a half back. It's getting a two because it's a movie with a beginning, middle and, end.",0
76,"There was little to no growth to Carol's character. I felt no connection nor inspiration. She had no flaws. Flaws that would have made her a real and relatable character. Flaws that would have made her human. Carol sacrificed very little thoughout the movie as well. One of the defining traits of a hero is the willingness to sacrifice for the good of others. The one sacrifice she makes is to blow the core of the ship, but it seemed more out of spite then in service to others. The rest of the movie is Carol being to powerful for the enemy to deal with. She flaunts her powers around immaturely as if expecting others to respect her because she has them. This is a trait I attribute to antagonists more then protagonists. This would have been a fine trait to have if it ment character growth, leading to her humbling herself.",0
77,"It's kinda bland, with a dull and very wooden Brie Larson 'doin' it for the gals'. If you do happen to get dragged along to this bloated and forgettable romp rest assured there is entertainment to be found in the form of a very entertaining Samuel L Jackson. The CGI used to make him appear twenty years younger is amazing.",0
78,"This movie is very boring. Carol Danvers was never in any danger in this film and just defeated her enemies too easily. The cgi and fight scenes were clunky and just bad. Goose the cat was disappointing, how Fury lost his eye is even more disappointing, and disappointing is how I would describe this movie.",0
79,"I wanted to like this film but aside from the marketing , as a film I got bored and when the main character looks as bored as i was theres a problem. the hero moments felt unearned, the humour fell flat and massive parts of the marvel cinematic universe were retconned for the sake of this movie and character. a big mis step for marvel. shame",0
80,"Missing any real sense of a story they tried to make it about the actress. If you don't care about the characters your movie, like this one, will fail. Save your money.",0
81,Marvel has usually been a good choice everytime before. This movie was a really boring and the cast was not good. Im really sad i even went to watch this movie.,0
82,"Girlfriend dragged me to it. I expected it to suck, but hoped that the negative hype was wrong...It was crap. I made my girlfriend pay for my ticket. Hollow characters, crap acting (didn't she win an oscar?), very wtf script (not tied to thanos??). Cat was the best part.",0
83,"The movie itself is about as generic as they come. Is it possible for you to not roll your eyes and fall a sleep during this bore of a movie? Sure, but most people are not going to come away thinking this was worth their time let alone their money.Why I'm giving this a 0 is to make a clear statement about how they handled the PR for this film. Even the film itself is hating on ""white males"" at every opportunity and it's frankly sad. Brie Larson in her attempt at ""diversity"" have actually accomplished the complete opposite. She has offended the majority of this movies target audience by her sexist antics and I hope the movie gets punished in review and sales from this. Disney needs to know their behavior with Rotten Tomatoes will not be forgotten. What a train wreck really.",0
84,"This movie seems like it was made from a 'super hero mad lib'.  It is all standard boil plate, with noting new or exciting, it is worse than ""Man of Steal"", in the sense that ""Captain Marvel"" has no weakness, never struggles and is uninteresting. Even when compared to some of the worst Marvel movies, this one stands out as the worst.  Some movies just don't add anything to the universe, this movie subtracts from it.",0
85,"There is plenty in Captain Marvel to jar, dissapoint and annoy comic fans and followers of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but those problems have been hinted at and discussed ad nauseum elsewhere, as have Brie Larson’s offensive comments while promoting the film. Those issues might be overcome if the film was wildly entertaining, or it’s main character relatable and engaging, or if familiarity with the character and her story were necessary to an enjoyment of the much anticipated Endgame. Sadly, none of those things are true. Captain Marvel is a colossal bore. There is an abundance of action, but no meaning. The arc of growth and self discovery, the vulnerability,  that so endeared us to Tony Stark, Steve Rodgers, Thor, Black Widow, and the Red Witch are apparently unnecessary for Captain Marvel.  Carol Danvers spends the film confused about who she is, but at no point does she have to earn what she is. And that’s dull. Throw in tired “you go girl” and “don’t politely call me young lady or I’ll put my boot up your ass” feminist tropes and it becomes downright annoying. The only thing flatter than the character’s arc of self discovery is Brie Larson’s phlegmatic delivery-every bit as bad as the trailers led us to fear. And the only thing flatter than that, is her unattractive rear end. The audience is left with very little to like, and all of that provided by supporting  charcters. Save yourself the cost of a ticket and two very tedious hours of your life-and pray Captain Marvel isn’t allowed to entirely ruin Endgame.",0
86,"The absolute most cringe-worthy Marvel movie.....movie ever maybe. It is all what you could expect. They turned a nice comic book character into pure trash, like almost everything in Marvel comics in this decade and now try to pass it in a movie. The result is just what was to be expected, cringe of a movie, boring and not worth watching.",0
87,"Where do I start with this one, the acting was horrible, the performance was half decent at best, the story wasn't so good at all. Overall the Movie was boring, it was a lackluster Movie. Also, if there's one thing I hate about a Movie, It's forcing politics, superhero Movies are supposed to be for fun and Entertainment purposes only, so I don't know why politics is being mixed in. If I go to see a superhero Movie in the Cinemas, I expect a fun and entertaining Movie, and if the Movie does good, it does good. No need to shove gender politics down our throats to force the Movie to do better than what it is!",0
88,"I had free tickets to see this... and it was a net lost for me... Not great... just sorta a boring movie with a female lead shoehorned in.... just because? IDK, I'd pass...",0
89,Both me and the wife could not wait to see this. Well not what we expected that's for sure.Boring to say the least. Could of used more of Mr. Jackson......he might of saved this if you had lol! And for god's sake please stop putting today's politics in movies! We get enough from the news media we don't need it in our movies!!!!,0
90,"My friends invited me but I have never seen a marvel film besides iron man one. I don’t know if this movie is indicator on marvel films, but for now, I have no interest in marvel films. I liked the comic relief and opening scene I guess, but it’s a very uninspired film with a huge budget.",0
91,"When i read the positive reviews which start of great acting of Samuel L. Jackson (not the main character) it says something. For me it is alike, i find Brie's acting uninteresting, another actress with one facial expression. They are trying to ride on 90's nostalgia, and i see you are pulling my leg. Would totally rather see a BlackWidow , Scarlet witch, Okoye, Shuri, Melinda May or Daisy Johnson Movie as a main character. Yes Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. were ton better actors. You want to see a true heroine movie ? Go see Wonder Woman or Alita, both are great, involving, great acting and story telling.",0
92,"It would have gotten a 2 or 3 just because it wasn't a good movie on it's own, but destroying Fury's character and retconning other better movies dropped it to a 0. Terrible.",0
93,"I wished I had went with my gut, and avoided this movie. I didn't like Bri Larson, and the more I saw of her the more I saw of her leading up to this movie the more I dreaded the release. But I like the MCU and I grew up with these comics. I think she was miscast. If I have to choose between her and Thanos, I would go with him.",0
94,Not a good movie. Plot is very confusing. Brie Larson's acting is a joke. I walked out after an hour it was so bad. You have no idea what is happening throughout the film until the end. more left wing politics shoved down your throat. I can't think of much good in this film other than the cat was cute.,0
96,"One of the worst MCU movies.  Over powered character with no weakness = Mary Sue.  Fury and the cat make the movie tolerable, but that is all.  Fight scenes were sub par, same with plot/ story arc.  It doesn't add anything to the 10 years of MCU story building they have done.  This should have been a Black Widow movie, a character people know already from the MCU movies",0
97,"The media really overhyped this poorly written and poorly acted film, even my daughter found it boring with tiring humor, just save your money...",0

I had a free ticketMe: If you had to pay would you still like it?Dad: I wouldn’t be impressed if I paid full price.Me: If you paid full price to watch it, how would you rate it?Dad: 3 out of 10.",0
100,"Brie Larson performance is terrible, plot is bad and disrespectful for source material. Worst Marvel movie so far.",0
101,"What a waste of money. The character had almost no development, essentially being the same person from the beginning to the end. No flaws and overpowered. I felt at no point during the movie she'd be in danger.",0
102,The acting in this movie was not very good. This studio has produced better films.,0
103,The biggest Letdown there has ever been for a marvel movie. Brie Larson acted terribly emotionless and dull through the whole movie. Waste of time and money.,0
104,"As bland as the blandest of Marvel movies, and Brie Larson lacks personality in the role. Didn't help that the movie so ham fisted tries to push feminist propaganda instead of a good movie.Do yourself a favor and buy a copy of Wonder Woman instead of seeing this disaster...",0
105,"Half the movie is just talking , Captain Marvel is so boring and unfunny . We watch business movies because we want more VFX scenes , if we prefer story than VFX , we will choose movies like Green Book . I used to thought Ant-Man and the Wasp is the worst Marvel movie , now Captain Marvel is even worse . Marvel used to bring us good movies like Captain America: Civil War , but now it's just getting more commercial since 2018 . I am done with it , maybe i will still watch Marvel's business movies , but certainly not quite a lot .",0
106,"Wasn't planning on watching this, but my wife bought tickets so off we went. And I can honestly say, the political issues surrounding Brie Larson aside, that this is not a good movie. It seemed very uninspired, Larson indeed seemed very wooden like a lot of the reviewers are saying, and almost completely devoid of personality or charisma. There were long stretches when we were both quite bored and when the action did kick in, it wasn't convincing. The movie as a whole seemed like it was trying too hard - and failing. The jokes fell flat; they seemed forced and too obvious. I haven't seen any of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's other work, and I've always respected Marvels ability to choose directors who haven't necessarily had big blockbuster experience but do have good artistic instincts...but in this case it didn't work. They should not be let near another marvel film, or any other big budget blockbuster probably.As for the woke factor, while it was never very overtly crammed down your throat, I did still get the sense that this was targeted at a certain  audience, young girls in particular. So Maybe Larson was right after all - middle aged white dudes need not attend.",0
107,"I am not allowed to review this movie, but I am going to do it anyway. Went to see it on the premiere. Boring, bland and the lead character has no charisma whatsoever. If it wasn't for the fact that this is a Marvel movie, I don't think people would even give this the time of the day.",0
108,"Boring performances, Brie Larson is the wrong person to play the Character of Carol Danvers.",0
109,mediocre at best ending dosent make any seance a horrible representation of woman,0
110,"Not as bad as I expected it to be, but that doesnt say much.Its just unremarkable, the sidecharacters are more interesting and memorable than the main one, the action is just meh, the story is just meh,...If this movie stood on its own I would propably rate it a bit higher, but this is part of the MCU, you have expectations here.There are some good bits in it but they are few and far between, ultimately its neither completely terrible nor unwatchable, just really disappointing.",0
111,"Confused and retconned plot, mixed pacing and a main character that has no personality. I wish they followed Wonder Woman's example and cast an actress that suits the role. The CGI is what earns my score.",0
112,"Due to all the controversy around Captain Marvel, the bad PR, the bigotry of Brie Larson, I was not going into this movie expecting it to be great, hell, I didn't expect it to be good. I did have faith that Marvel, despite this, could make it alright though, so I went in expecting it would get a 5, MAYBE a 6 out of 10. I was very disappointed.Brie Larson never seemed to embody the character she was acting. When I watch Iron Man, I see Tony Stark and not RDJ. When I watch the Avengers I see Black Widow, not SJ. When I watched Captain Marvel I never saw Captain Marvel, it was always Brie Larson trying to act. She never once truly embodied her character.And I am going to TRY to ignore all the changes made from the comic book version, as other movies have made changes as well (but none as much as this horrid movie).But now I am going to get into spoiler territory.To make matters worse, Captain Marvel was the closest thing to a Mary Sue that you can get without having a Mary Sue. Whenever there was a need for her to improve it never seemed like she struggled and got better, it seemed like she just powered up for no good reason. Oh, she needs more power, well now she can use al her power without the limiter! Oh, she is falling, potentially to her death? Now she can fly and do so pretty damn well.Furthermore, the story just sucked. Anyone that watched Guardians of the Galaxy or Agents of SHIELD knows that the Kree are not good guys, so the whole ""twist"" that they aren't good guys was pointless. The plot was cliched as well, falling into the same old tropes without any originality. Furthermore, there were plot points that seemed to either make no sense or even contradict what we know from previous entries in the MCU.And the whole backstory of hers where she was talked down to over and over again for being a girl was really forced and seemed entirely political, which really caused me to hate this movie even more, especially with some of Brie Larson's comments about white men.When I saw the early access critics talking good about the movie (which all early access critics do, whether a movie is good or not) and focusing on the cat, I thought that was a joke, but no, the interactions with Fury and the cat were the only parts of the movie I truly can say I enjoyed.So, acting was horrible, plot was cliched and seemed to ignore the rest of the MCU, etc.I can only give this movie, at best, 2.5/10, but since I have to round it I am choosing to round down to 2.I am not surprised by the rumors of other Marvel actors being disappointed in Brie and Captain Marvel, and my only hope is that there is enough time before Endgame to ensure that the movie is not ruined by this awful entry.",0
113,"I put all the Leads Actresses words aside to not affect my film experience/opinion, to give it a fair chance. And yet upon completion of watching this film, it was Abundantly clear that this film was themed to ""Hate men"", ""Hating men is my Strength and source of Motivation"". This film is bland, it's lead actress is racist, Sexist, and her portrayal of this character adds fuel to the fire. She needs to be held accountable and replaced. This movie was nothing special. Which is sad, because it could have been and Should have been so much more.",0
114,"Not sure why I bothered to go see this, the MCU has been going downhill for a while and this just confirms it. The plot is meandering and incoherent, the villain is forgettable, and Brie Larson herself is just so, so, underwhelming in every way (and the terrible case of resting b**ch face sure doesn't help). These superhero moves have gotten way too generic and same-y, I think after Avengers: Endgame I'm going to call it quits with them.",0
115,"If this is what the MCU thought would pass as a back story for the most powerful character in end game i am suddenly very disheartened and what they plan to give us as the final chapter of a phenomenal franchise. The optimist in me wants to say ""it could always be worse"" but something that bad would end up being so bad it's funny. This was bad bad.",0
116,"A MCU movie and thats about it, poor story badly executed. You can´t make a 7 layer dip from corn. How can you spend so much money/budget on a movie like this, while great shows (like on Netflix) have been cancelled with a greater quality and story line.",0
117,"I'll try to focus on the film itself notwithstanding the controversy of Brie Larson's conduct.As a super hero movie goes - it's just boring. Even if one ignores all the political messaging with in my view is unnecessary and annoying; one is left with a bog standard plot and some terrible performances (though to be fair the actors have very little to work with as the script is very poor - some of the dialogue is just cringe-worthy).But the absolute worst disappointment of the film is Brie herself - she just can't carry it. That overarching sense of boredom that robs the story of any real impetus or excitement emanates from the leading actor herself. It is so obvious we have an actor playing a hero. Compare this performance with Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman and the difference is night and day - Gadot owned the character, became the character and brought the audience along with her. Larson on the other hand has all the emotional range of a house brick and it shows in every painful scene the audience is forced to watch.So the film is hamstrung by a poor story but totally let down by the miscasting of Larson. I do wonder whether the marketing folks saw this early and so decided to try and stir up controversy with all the political virtue signalling in an effort to distract from a very weak and disappointing performance.",0
119,"Movie was very meh. There are worse Marvel movies (Iron Man 3 and Thor 2), but this is definitely in my bottom 3. If they want to make Captain Marvel the new ""face"" of the MCU, then I will be picking and choosing which future movies I see rather than seeing them all like I have been.",0
120,"Ok ok, first off I'm here on Meta Critic because if you review it on Rotten tomatoes and it's not positive they just take it down. This is propaganda. On to the movie. The special effects are good as always. However, it falls off a cliff in almost every other respect. I feel like watching a movie or reading a comic is all about escaping reality and just having a good time. So watching a comic book movie should really be about that. Instead politics and SJW stuff is being jammed in my face. I'm over it. I regret giving them my money.",0
121,It would seem they never read a Capt. Marvel comic... Her personality was a Cross between Capt. America(his sense of duty) & Spidermans (sense of great responsibility) along with her constantly questioning if she's doing the right thing which makes her very emotional... What they did to her here was throw all that out and push this I'm a total emotionless badass robot... Alita: Battle Angel showed a whole lot more emotions and she was a digitized robot! PS: there seems to be a lot of controversy surrounding the reviews to this movie with claims of it being review bombed... which may be the case... But what they aren't telling you is there's a equally polar effect happening with SJWs upvoting it as well... True reviews should range from 2 to 6 it's poorly written & lacking in every possible way... any reviews straying outside these parameters shouldn't be trusted... I would of given it a 3...but after what they Did with Nick fury's eye nonsense they should be glad it only got a 2!,0
122,"The plot is quite weak, but not as weak as Brie Larson's acting. Sam Lee Jackson tries to save what he can, but overall it's a bad movie. Not reccomended.",0
123,"Not the worst MCU film. I'd rate it somewhere between Thor 2 and Ant-Man.Emily Blunt would have knocked this role out of the park, and I believe that's where most of the problems lie: poor casting for the leading role.The story behind Fury's missing eye also feels like both forced humor and a missed opportunity for something more interesting.",0
124,"I was bored frequently during this movie. I can only remember one fight scene and the rest were pretty forgettable. If you put aside the fact that Brie Larson was not the right choice for this movie, it's still a Marvel movie that nobody asked for, about an unpopular marvel character. And according to the credits scene, now we're stuck with Cap Marvel in the MCU moving forward. She will be a significant character and I'm losing interest fast.",0
125,"An average superhero flick let down by obnoxious ""valley girl"" acting from Brie Larson. She did not strike me as Captain Marvel. A better alternative would be someone like Robin Wright. Having said that, the action scenes and special effects provide some minutes of entertainment. Nick Fury's ""de-aging"" was flawless and I didn't get any uncanny valley feeling, unlike Princess Leia in TLJ.Unfortunately, considering the movie's overall mediocrity, I felt it went on for way too long, and left extremely disappointed. The final act was especially jarring.",0
126,This was a slow and boring movie. The action scenes were good. Jude law did a great job. But Brie Larson acting was terrible. I was shocked. Brie did not act very well and her athletic coordination does not exist. They need recast Brie Larsons role in the movie. It got to the point I was not sure if I was watching a Girl power movie or a Captain Marvel movie. The movie was just a bad movie. I was bored and checking facebook throughout the movie.,0
127,Well I guess you could say Captain Marvel isn’t so “Marvelous”. Seriously though how do you mess up captain marvel this bad?,0
128,"Went and saw this movie this morning with my two nieces. We left the theater kinda disappointed. It's a movie I think I would have rather waited for until it came out to rent on DVD (for a lot cheaper).The Good: I really liked the Stan Lee tribute and cameo at the beginning of the movie. The Captain Marvel origin story is pretty good. Some of the acting was good. The special effects were good. The cat was great.The Bad: The pacing of the movie is off (especially at the beginning). Too much story crammed into only a 2h 4m movie. Tons of expositions. The forced puns and jokes aren't funny (no one in the theater laughed at the obvious attempt). Bre Larsen's acting is mediocre and her range is lack-luster. The writing is kinda sketchy and bad in places (especially on WHY Captain Marvel is so over-powered and nigh God-like). The plot seems oddly familiar -- certain scenes are exceptionally reminiscent of Captain America. Captain Marvel has ZERO weaknesses -- at no point during the film do you feel or sense that Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers is in any danger. The ""secrete"" end credit clip honestly kind of turned me off from wanting to see Avengers Endgame. The way they portrayed it made it seem like Captain Marvel is completely taking over and will come to the Avenger's rescue and defeat Thanos all by herself.",0
129,I regret wasting my money.  Very sad.  It is boring and insulting to the watcher.  I think we are now seeing the beginning of the end of Super Hero Movies.  Anything the House of Mouse touches has that reverse Midas Touch.,0

131,"I rue the day when the MCU falls into abject mediocrity; but this is that day. Uninspired characters, contrived plot, and boring action means this film will only satisfy the most fanboy of fanboys. Even as a standalone film, this is preposterously bad - but I fear this will be hard linked into the conclusion of the Avengers arch. I genuinely wish this film would have much, much more.",0
132,"Brie Larson may be a brilliant actress, but you'd never know it from this movie. She has to play a Mary Sue, so there's no compelling tension to her character. She's a total bore. Watching her character arc is like watching paint dry. With a few exceptions, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is the only real entertainment in the movie, but this movie isn't about Nick Fury.  It's about how Captain Marvel is about to ruin Avengers: Endgame, more's the pity. Oh, and don't waste your time writing a review on Rotten Tomatoes.  They are publishing some negative audience reviews, but they're filtering out a good percentage of them in order to keep the score from plummeting too low. For shame, RT. You are rotten.",0
133,"Bad writing bad acting bad pacing, they didn’t think about the mcu while making this.",0
134,"I didn't really have any high hopes for this movie after all the misandry involved in the marketing but man was I let down!The story is boring, the leading actress has is as good at displaying emotions as the one in twilight.",0
135,"Aside from Iron Man 2 and Thor: Dark World, this is by-far the worst installment into the MCU. The best word that I can use to describe this movie is FLAT. Larson is easily the least convincing superhero that I have ever seen on the big screen, and probably small screen included as well. Villain(s) are horrible. Goose is good, but not great like everyone has been clamoring about. There is no evidence that Captain Marvel will swoop in and save the day. Her power levels felt comparable to Iron Man (maybe), and certainly not anywhere near Thor, Hulk, or Scarlet Witch level at any point. The levels of unconvincing in this movie are astounding. If she is to be the face of the MCU moving forward then prepare for the oncoming nosedive....",0
136,Captain Narcissist channels her victim complex and her inferiority complex to punch old ladies. I liked the Skrulls. Great to finally see them in the MCU.,0
137,I went out of curiosity and it was booooooring. Brie Larson was not a good choice for captain Marvel and her performance was very mediocre. The fight scenes were pretty lack luster and felt like they tried to do man of Steel but somehow made it worse than Man of Steel. Also this film just felt like filler for endgame and that bothered me more than the other stuff. I left a little over halfway and got a refund. I was sorely disappointed.,0
138,"Not great. Had a few fun moments, but overall very bland. Of all the MCU movies, I rank right above Thor: The Dark World and right below The Incredible Hulk. I really don't ever want to see this movie again. I hope Captain Marvel is not a big part of later movies in the MCU.",0
139,"only reason i gave this move 1/10 and not 0/10 is for the stan lee tribute, other than that awful movie not worth the time let along the 15$ ticket",0
140,"Wonder woman was awesome, had everything. This is like opposite. Boring, bad acting. Even Samuel L. Jackson not trying much..",0
142,Very boring movie with a b-rated plot and a wooden main actress performance. Rating 0 because nothing is lost without seeing this movie. Better watch any Steven Seagal movie for a better plot and definitely superior acting.,0
143,"They ruined the possibility of the Secret Invasion, which I thought was supposed to be the whole point of this movie. :(",0
144,"boring, wooden acting subpar special effects nothing special or interesting",0
145,"Never expected this garbage. After the thanos snap this movie is the largest disaster in the MCU. Poor acting, poor plot. I found the acting very repulsive. Captain herself single handedly did the marvel to ruin the Marvel universe.",0
146,"Boring, generic, a total Mary Sue of a character, Marvel is going the same way like Star Wars, I hope they chang their minds, TOTAL FAILURE",0
147,I wanted to like this movie expecting something aggressively average... I was disappointed. I'll give this movie a 2.0 hopefully the all female Avengers will be better than this.,0
148,So i am writing this hoping to stay unbiased (as i am a strait white men). The movie just is not good and i am very disappointed because i was looking forward for the first woman led MCU movie. I hope that the next try is much better(give us a black widow movie pls). Please dont say i am a troll or sth. I am a 100% defender of gender equality and woman rights and i want more woman lead roles. Happy womans day to everybody!,0
149,"Movie is boring, worst actress ever, don't waste your time on this movie, watch something else.",0
150,"The films is nothing that special tbh, well besides that cat, best part so cute.",0
151,This is just a bland movie with an emotionless actor in the lead role. Marvel needs to be careful if it doesn't want to die after Endgame if this is a sign of future movies.,0
152,"The plot was good, but the story line of Carol Danvers was basically a straight line. The only struggle she had was not knowing answers to questions, when she found out the answer...she just destroyed everything, answered every challenge, and...won. No character struggle, arch, development. She just comes in, beats everyone and thats the end. Very poorly executed. ALL other Marvel/MCU characters have an inner struggle, they taste defeat and they pull themselves up and overcome. Danvers just uses ""Girl Power!""...and smashes everything.",0
153,"This is a boring movie and that is the worst thing you can say about an MCU movie. Brie Larson has the same expression the whole time, there's no character development, action sequences are generic, really disrespectful to the other movies and continuity. Cannot recommend this!",0
155,"Boring, clunky and forced.  Humor falls flat and action was uninspired.  BL didn't seem to give the character any gravity, and the script didn't help.",0
156,"The worst Marvel movie so far. The effects are great, the story and the protagonist are way below average.",0
157,"I was waiting for the movie and very excited, but turned out to be a disappointment for me , I’m so sad about it .",0
158,this movie is the worst of all the MCU is the most boring thing I've seen the special effects are unfortunate it seems that it was a movie made for television the performance brie larson is bad the only thing that saves the movie is Nick fury in a few words this movie it's a throwback to Marvel totally unnecessary,0
159,"The de-aging of Samuel L. Jackson was amazing to see on screen. The remainder of the movie is boring and forgettable. Poor script, poorly scripted action sequences (except for one very early on). Not sure where Marvel went wrong here with such a track record of good movies in the MCU.",0
160,"Yeah, I got a little bored towards the end. Not the best Marvel movie, IMHO.",0
161,"HONEST LONG REVIEWS: You know, I’m normally a Marvel fan, but I have to give it a NO for this one. First of all, I was a little bit hesitant on whether I should watch the film or not. Almost a thousand of reviews in a Facebook group (Movie lovers) that I’m in said that they felt really disappointed after watching the film and put it as the least enjoyable movies created by marvel. However, since I was scared that i might not understand the Avengers-End game, I decided to give it a shot. And yeah, I’m quite disappointed and the reasons are just like the posted feedbacks from the group.. Firstly, I am also a woman and so do my friends, but we just think that it might have been better, if they recasted Captain Marvel. Brie is perfectly beautiful and we do really enjoy some of her previous films, but in this film, she is just not giving the strongest heroic vibe to the audience. Her acting isn’t that strong like Johansson or she’s not even as powerful, charismatic or bad ass as Wonder Woman or Harley Quinn. I felt like I have to build up all the excitement during the film by myself. Secondly, the plot is a little too plain. I mean, if she’s going to be the strongest of them all, why is she just simply looks like a plain unbeatable fly-able hero with flames. Just that ( I don’t know if it’s because of the plot or Brie, but the character is just strong because she‘s called Captain Marvel.) Thirdly, I know that the film wants to support feminism, but I also felt like some of the parts in the film tried to portray men as the bad rude people. To be honest, Captain Marvel is not that bad. I may still recommend it to some of my friends, but there were just some parts that some of the audiences including me agree that it might could have been better. Oh also, the cat is incredibly cool.",0
162,The negatives:Badly cast lead - Emily Blunt should have got the rolePoor fight scenesPoor villains,0
163,"Garbage Actor, recast Captain Marvel and salvage the character. Brie Larson is the wrong person for the job and her crappy attitude and acting in general isn't wanted.",0
164,"Since Rotten Tomatoes is deleting all my reviews, I will attempt to share it here. This movie is a waste of two hours. The positives are that the movie is not entirely focused on making a statement about ""White Male Privilege"", but that is definitely showcased multiple times throughout the movie. (Barf!) Now the negative. They took away any semblance of the character Nick Fury that we know and love. They made him a doe-eyed clueless agent that simply followed Brie Larson's character around for the most part. Brie Larson is, as advertised, an emotionless actress. Captain Marvel never really comes alive. I enjoyed the bad guys more than any of the heroes in this movie. Maybe it's just because I'm a 'White Dude' but I would of happily put money into watching a good Marvel movie more than once if I had been wrong.",0
165,"The film is mediocre a bit bland at times, SL Jackson is the only saving grace, it makes me frustrated as it's likely that they will use her cut of the End Game instead of Black Widow and Captain America's version,They ruined Nick Fury's eye story. glad that they added the tribute to Stanley I added a rating point for that. if they continue down this crazy identity politics kick I will stop supporting the MCU like I have for Star Wars. there are so many stories that are women centric that don't need to be Mary Sues why do this to a great franchise?",0
166,"Poor performance by Larson, no emotion or chemistry with other actors. Bland action and in a Marvel movie that is unacceptable. Lacklustre script filled with feminist overtones. But at least the cat is good.",0
167,"I have been a fan of Comics for a long time and surprisingly I have been a fan of the MCU even if they have taken some liberties with beloved characters, I fell its mostly been an amazing ride with some amazing movies., That is until I watched Captain Marvel. I have heard that that main actress of this film has no interested in the opinions of my kind, but ill give it anyway.. This was easily the worst origins story there has been, Carol is very hard to like or sympathize with as she apparently is just perfect and unstoppable, giving the character nothing for the viewer to relate to on a human level. Basically the whole movie is a paint by numbers, cookie cutter action hero film, drenched with ideological politics, designed to indoctrinate young girls into a culture of men hate and excess self importance (modern day feminism) it dosent make for a good film and its the first step in the end of the MCU. Oh But the cat was OK, it a cat! they needed something likable in the film. Its a shame because after Brie Larson last few films I was becoming a huge fan of hers, she was the best part in 21 jump Street and Room was just an incredible film that sticks with me to this day.. But then she has to show who she really was, publicly letting me know that she hates me and other like me, simply because of the race and gender I was born with.",1
168,"If I were to sum up this movie in three words they would be: bland, unimaginative and unwanted. It says it all when the cat is the most attractive part of the movie.There is some great supporting roles in this movie (the reason I've not given it zero) but unfortunately that isn't enough to save a movie that no one was asking for.If they wanted to make a solo movie with a strong female lead they needed to have looked no further than Black Widow. Scarlett Johansson has been kicking ass as Natasha Romanoff for the better part of a decade.",0
169,"I actually love Captain Marvel (the character) and wanted to love this movie. But alas, I didn't. It's plot is disjointed, it's progress a snail's pace, and I think was the nail in the coffin for superhero movies for me. I'm done, Marvel. Disney has killed Star Wars & Marvel with their political overtures.",0
170,movie made for 14 years old teens.worse than iron man 3. dont bother to watch,0
171,Movie feels generic and has a dull story. The main actress is a total miscast.,0
172,Worst Marvel movie by far. It's not only the blatant insertion of identity politics into what should be an escape from real life. Brie is a an absolute disaster as an actress. I've seen her do a better job in other movies so it's possible she was miscast for this role. The pacing was erratic and mostly slow. I was yawning my way through this movie.,0
173,"Stan Lee's tribute was nice. Some of the action sequences were entertaining but some were bad and needed too many cuts. Everything else was bad.Jackson does well but plays a very watered down Fury. The surprise involving him was DUMB.Brie's character was unrelatable. Her ""feminist"" struggle in no way impacts her character to add actual depth. Her personal struggle in the movie is: she's so strong she has to overcome being held back by father figures, but she doesn't need to go through any personal growth to accomplish this - her memories just have to come back to her.Skrulls are completely ruined.Actual plot is sacrificed to deliver a mixed message that refugees & terrorists are misunderstood innocents that just need help finding a home. And I don't know if this was a shot at US politics & military (analogous to the Star Force) OR an anti-Israel anti-Semitic message. Either way it's BAD.What are you doing Marvel!?",0
174,"Ojito que van spoilers...Bien, a lo que nos toca. Desde hace ya algunos días he venido escuchando y leyendo críticas de esta película, no quería creerlas pero tenían razón. La película es demasiado genérica, creo que la aparición de Collson fue lo único que realmente me llamó la atención y el homenaje a Stan fue lo unico que me gustó.Yo no sé mucho del universo marvel; pero que los skrulls solo buscasen ser rescatados me pareció demasiado predecible, no me presenta algo que me mantenga al borde de la silla. Vamos, realmente solo quería saber como perdió el ojo Fury y hasta eso fue absurdo, en películas anteriores el dijo: La última vez que confié en alguien, perdí un ojo. Supuse que Carol, El Skrull (no recuerdo el nombre) o alguien cercano lo haría, jamás de los jamases pensé que sería el gato, y jugando al final de la película; eso fue un insulto muy grande. En fin, no deja nada establecido para End Game ni es relevante, supongo planean una secuela luchando contra los Kree pero me presenta la duda de como será. Se presenta a Ronan como el lider Kree y los guardianes ya lo vencieron, entonces no logro ubicar en que momento es que Carol va a luchar contra él sin presentar un problema argumental con las películas de los guardianes.En aspecto técnicos no es mala; pero no destaca ni es visualmente atractiva. Concluyo, no es buena, si la van a ver que sea en DVD o en día de descuento porque no es ni relevante ni lo suficientemente entretenida como para un plan de fin de semana en pareja ni con los niños.",0
175,A way too powerful main character = the worst MCU movie. Even Superman has Cryptonite and close relatives to care about. Great cat though.,0
176,"I love the MCU… Unfortunately, this movie has tarnished that…To me this movie makes no sense, a new (minor) hero appears, made insanely powerful, fights against a weak protagonist, rewriting MCU canon that has been loved by fans for multiple years along the way. All the time showing a broad array of lacklustre CGI, boring forgettable action sequences, and the leading actress is just a wrong cast for a super hero. The main character is a cardboard cut-out of what a hero should be, zero charisma and no idea how to play an MCU superhero. Pity MCU could not get an actress with the charisma and presence of Gal Gadot for their first female lead movie.What’s most annoying is why must you suddenly change MCU history overnight… why Marvel?Why would you make Nick Fury appear like some bumbling sidekick? That alone should be a sin, he is a strong leader and was never a follower of anyone... Social politics at play maybe?Everything aside this is a poor movie by MCU standards, I would put it below Iron Man 2, it really is that bad!  Not from a box office $$$ point of view, I am sure it will make a lot of money on the back of the loyal MCU fans. Your problem Marvel is loyalty is quickly lost when you betray your loyal fan base, just hope this lemon of a movie doesn’t do that.",0
177,"very bad written characters, especially Brie ""SJW"" Larson. didn't expect much. still disappointed",0
179,"Samuel L. Jackson is on fantastic form as usual & Jude Law is unexpectedly rather good. Unfortunately, the movie comes across as quite dull & in somewhat of the same vein as the First Avenger (though that movie was a lot more fun), just an inconsequential stepping stone to greater things. Overall, a film that wasn't wanted or asked for. Just a bit pointless, all in all.",0
180,"Probably the only time you'll say, DC did it better, Go see Wonder Woman instead, steer clear.",0
181,If the supporting characters outclasses the actor set up to carry the torch in the next years your franchise is in trouble. Larson is miscast as a MCU her-o.This would be a 4 out of 10 movie.But since this is the usual empowerment **** which requires a Mary Sue and putting others down to succeed I will reduce the score buy 4 points to send a clear message to Marvel that virtue signaling is unwanted in the MCU universe.,0
182,"This film is dull and cringey.  It's a big step backward for the MCU to do this sort of superhero origin tale that we've seen so many times, most recently in Ant Man and Doctor Strange, although those were much better.  But this time it's a woman!!!  So it's unique.And that's the real goal of the film and marketing.  We'll just look past Wonder Woman who already did a female superhero much better in 2017.  We'll also overlook Brie Larson as a spoiled blonde girl trying to play victim here based on her identity (are you serious?).  If you buy into this nonsense and want to have your agenda validated and be pandered to, you might enjoy this film.  If you have common sense, see through this farse, and just want to see a good addition to the MCU you will be very disappointed.  I just hope Marvel figures out how much they failed with this character before she ruins EndGame and phase 4.",0
183,"Once again, the ""hype"" inversely proportional to the type of quality needed in the MCU. Has everyone forgotten that the movies are entertainment, NOT a class room. This won't sway me from Endgame since we've made it this far. I did not leave, nor jeered at the screen with ALL those ""I'm Better than you!"" , smirks. Talk with the antagonistic, taunt them, take a few of there best shots then craft a well thought out, gut-wrench come back. But when the protagonist is just a shell, with no depth, there is no where to reach from...so all answers are there for you in the first place. Don't waist you time or money. Don't take your poor kids, so you don't have to answer their innocent honest questions.  Maybe some of this hated fan base (Why are movie execs, media and some actors portraying the loyal fan bases  of a series of genre as bad? Why, that completely boggles my mind. They have every right to make a film, song, post, blog, etc the way they personally want it. And as the public, we can agree or disagree...enjoy or not. It's our responsibility to check people just like we are checked every day. Sorry, I went off on a tangent.) honest opinions will make sense to them. Make something with pride, quality and care, and that's a pretty good idea to start from. No agendas any more...please. Thank you.",0
184,The film is very boring and too childish. The main character is boring and uninteresting. The worst Marvel movie and the worst cast,0
185,"Captain Generic is more accurate. I enjoyed the cat, the younger CGI for Nick Fury's face was mostly quite good, other than that a mediocre movie. Marvel better tighten their quality control.",0
186,"I do not recommend this MCU Movie. The movie was generally bland and boring, with a bland and emotionless performance from the lead actress, subpar character development on a character that seems invulnerable with no stakes or risks. A big disappointment coming from Marvel. It gets a 2 only because of good special effects.",0
187,"This is a bland, below average mess of a movie. As a lead-in to End Game it's both inadequate and mundane. Brie Larson is miscast (Opportunity missed for Katee Sackhoff who would have killed in this part). Marvel history is disrespected. Just a disappointment and disrespect to the MCU Fans who have been soo loyal. This spoils the anticipation for End Game. Sad.",0
188,This movie is so boring that make people fall asleep. Brie Larson is just horrible. What happened Marvel???,0
189,"This was one on the most boring movies I have ever seen. Carol Danvers was uninteresting and had no character development at any point. Nick Fury and the Skrulls started off interesting but by the halfway point of the movie even they had been turned predictable and dull. The action is poorly choreographed and never had any tension. I had expected this to be one of the movies Marvel pulled out all the stops for like a Captain America or Black Panther, instead this was the worst movie of the series.",0
190,Thor the Dark World was better than this boring movie. Worst movie in the MCU by far.,0
191,"In short, the story simply lacks heart. I was looking forward to this two-hour long addendum to the end credit scene in Avengers: Infinity War. Sadly, there are far too many easily avoidable flaws here to capture the imagination. I suppose the good news is that Thor: Dark World has more company at the bottom of my MCU faves list now. The bad news is that Nick Fury's bizarre ""meh"" reaction to losing his eye near the end also sums up well my reaction to this film as a whole. Lazy writing and careless stewardship over the MCU continuity created wholly unnecessary disappointment for this fan.",0
192,"I liked all marvel movies, because I never really cared about the universe until I saw The Avengers 3 in the cinema's and it started to interest me. I rewatched a bunch and liked them, but sadly cpt marvel just doesnt do it for me and cringed me at times. The acting was below average from some actors aswell. You should keep the money or use it on movies like Alita. Why did Brie larson think it was a good idea to be a racist in public, keep it to yourself if u ever find another role.",0
193,"I just saw the movie .. it was TRASH . waste of digital artists and my time .. brie larson's poor attempts on being funny was a pain in the ass , MANY of the lines were feminist propaganda , the movie LOOKED and SOUNDED like a feminist propaganda .. Brie larson is not physically fit for captain marvel and she's not a good actor for it at all ; the character itself was portrayed  poorly  , the movie lacked interesting action and it didn't explain anything about how captain marvel became captain marvel and what the source of her powers is . and to be honest I only watched the movie because I thought it was linked to end game but I was disappointed ;  I would give the movie a 3 out of 10 and that is because of the CGI works on nick fury and the final battle scene which was the only interesting thing in the whole movie .. I'm disappointed as a BIG marvel fan ..﻿",0
194,"First off the film is dull as dishwater and the main character with it. The couple of good moments came from secondary characters, and all that isnt even mentioning the gut churning politics rammed down our throats...suffice to say i laughed out loud when ""just a girl"" started playing, because lets be real here, captain marvel is far from ""just a girl"".",0
195,"Incredible special effects with Samuel L Jackson's de-ageing, and he was the only saving grace in this movie. Brie could have been replaced with her own cardboard cutout and, for all I know, she was. Bland is the best way to describe her performance and the movie itself.",0
196,"Finished watching the film about an hour ago and have to say this. It is the most underwhelming of all marvel movies. Even when the lead actress is showing off her power(which no villain in the movie even comes close to matching), you feel absolutely nothing. I am a big Marvel fan and super hyped for Endgame.But this movie only justifies its ticket because of the two end-of-credits scene. Nothing else is memorable",0
197,This is what happens when you see your childhood stories get used for propaganda of a minority of individuals that think they are right. Not how Cpt Marvel was originally written at all. +1 star for the cat and flashy lights on screen.,0
198,A boring and uninspired Disney money grab. The introduction of the most powerful hero has the same character development and depth of the pizza delivery person in your favorite private movie. Disney played the Michael Bay card of a linear predictable action flick to appease an audience that just wants action without story. If you have any interest in the MCU then this is an awful way to introduce this character and spits in the face of Stan Lee’s vision that “I just tried to write characters who are human beings who also have superpowers”. This character lacks anything that it means to be human. We all sufferer from inadequacies in many manifestations but Larson just stumbles emotionlessly through this movie as she was sponsored by Prozac.,0
199,"honestly the worst marvel movie, story was garbage; nick fury loses his eye is just cheap writing. seems to be an after thought. Brie Larson's acting just awful worst than the star wars prequels, she doesn't show any emotions. RBF",0
200,"The movie is total boredom. Doesn't hold up to any marvel movie standard. Main character is typical mary sue without any charm. Save your money, don't waste them on this movie.",0
202,A dissapointment to superhero genre. Convoluted plot with slow pacing. Overused cgi and lack of characterization. And it has a poor script with the ideas almost copied form other films before. All of this thing turned the film into an abysmal generic flick.,0
203,This movie is a big let down after the wonderful Wonder Woman.  Brie Larson has no charisma as Captain Marvel.  Samuel L. Jackson was great as always.  This is in the bottom 4 MCU movies for me.  There is very little development for Carol Danvers and her character has a very limited character arc.  After gaining superpowers on par with Superman she doesn't even seem to take a minute and knows how to use them right away.  If this kind of careless storytelling (lazy) is the future of the MCU then I am seroulsy worried as a fan of the franchise from the start.,0
204,"This movie was so boring I almost fell asleep half way through. Bree Larson's acting is as stiff as cardboard. Worst MCU movie by far. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this snoozefest. You would be better served by seeing almost any other movie if you want something other than generic action and poor acting. Samuel L was OK, that is about the best thing I can say about this movie.",0
205,"I think it’s worth starting with the acting of Brie Larson. I think she is a talented actress (see “The Room”), but in this case it’s not her role. It is not even her fault. Rather, the claim to the director who saw it. Now move on to it smoothly. There are certainly a lot of good ideas in this film, but with poor implementation. The whole movie is literally crammed with silly and inappropriate jokes. And what they did with Fury ... My opinion about the Fury Character has been since the first Iron Man film appeared. He always seemed serious, wise, judicious, moderately strict and decisive. What did I see in Captain Marvel? From Fury, trying to make a jester that does not go in favor of the film. I do not want to talk only about cons.The film is and what to praise. Good spirit of the 80s. Feeling as if throughout the film, he does not leave you. And even in space in the ship you can see various slot machines and various attributes of the time.Also separately I want to skzat about a cat ""Goose"". Released in full colorful character. But nightmares will follow me for a long time after seeing a not quite high-quality CGI of cat.On this I will finish. Thanks for reading this.",0
206,"The worst Marvel movie (so far). Bland, painfully cheesy and predictable. Just wait for the post credit scenes to be uploaded to youtube and skip the rest. Also, the cat has a wider acting range than the main actress. She had the same ""I am soooo tough"" facial expression throughout the entire movie.",0
207,Waaay worst than Iron-Man 2 and Thor: The Dark World. The MCU didn't deserve this blot.,0
208,"Disastrous film. Captain wahmen as white girl who want diversity should have been recasted for any other woman of color. Zero emotions, zero of character development.",0
209,"This movie should be called ""Captain Robot"". Larson is a lifeless, soulless, uncharismatic bore. ""I dont remember my past... because it was deleted from my memory bank"". *BEEP*BOOP* This is the worst miscast roll in the history of superhero movies. Worst MCU movie to date.",0
210,"Súper aburrida, escenas de acción desabridas y efectivamente propaganda política por todos lados, no hechos tu dinero a este basurero",0
211,"I really wanted to like it but the lead is so dry and boring that it makes me want to fall asleep. Marvel made a big miscast with Brie, their going to need to redirect soon or lose millions",0
212,It was very plain sometimes boring even. And is it me but the villains were so bad in story and acting was not good from villains and form Brie Larson she was to plain and the back story was horrible basically none.,0
213,Not up to the usual MCU standards. Seems hastily done and ended up rather confusing. Worst of all sort of boring.,0
214,"The film has no stakes. The character 'Captain Marvel' is a typical Mary Sue, which makes for awful story telling. Factoring in Brie Larson's emotionless performance and you end up with a mediocre movie that is boring to watch.It's almost as if Marvel took everything that made 'Wonder Woman' such an amazing film and decided to go in the complete opposite direction.If Captain Marvel is to be the new face of the MCU, then I fear for 'End Game' and the future of this franchise.",0
215,"The story is awful, the cat is the best part of this entire movie, elektra from 2005 was a better movie then this and that was marvels first offical female superhero movie not captain marvel, captain marvel is the first movie in the mcu but its not their first female lead super hero movie, and the movie was just full of sjw **** that shouldn't have been in the movie, a black widow movie would of made more sense then this character who we have never heard of before the end of infinity war, comes out of left field and is somehow stronger then thanos, brie larson is a emotionless preformance and they play leaving a child to go save the world for laughs, they story writer for this movie might as well of been a toddler becuase even a 8 year old is more creative in story telling then this story writer, the entire movie is just girl power to the max, i am surprised they didnt beat the hell out of nick fury, and to get to nick fury, the de-aging tech made him look like a bloody wax model, or a freaking plastic doll. the entire story can be summed up as a stupid propaganda movie for the femenist and sjw's to feel happy, and for marvel to claim that they made their first female lead movie when it isn't elektra was a better movie then this garbage and it was made back in 2005 for peets sake, if anything carol danverse is the most unrelatable character in the history of the mcu, she shows no weakness, she shows hardly any emotions, she is perfect in every way, she is litterly a mary sue for gods sake, atleast in elektra, elektra shows emotion and has real emotions while protecting the people she was hired to kill.*EDIT*just had to check out some other things, and rewatch Elektra to make sure I was remembering correctly and i was not remembering it all correctly, ELektra would be a 9 and this movie would be a -4 if i could do that. I wish I could becuase this $h!t with nick fury about him having his eye scratched out by a cat, it wasn't even a mountain lion or a tiger, it was a bloody house cat, no body over the age of 10 should belive that a man like nick fury would loose his eye to a bloody cat, let alone a house cat, the way the battle with the mentor it seems to be saying well  F all white men and its litterly might as well be brain washing for young kids of the future so they turn into SJW's and ruin even more of movies and tv, Elektra bloody Elektra which critics hated was better then this garbage, and them blaming freaking white men for the bad reviews, i am a women and I hated this movie, the some of the mixed reviews of the critics hwere female i only think 1 female critic rated the movie as a positive, there is nothing in the credits for end game, dont go to see this movie, it is a waste of your money and a waste of time, its boring and will sometimes make you wonder what the hell where the people who rated this anything but a mixed or negative movie thinking, they are either fake reviews bought by disney or captain marvel or where SJW's and femenist, no one should watch this movie with a person who loves the black captain marvel, they changed captain marvel from black to white, she should of been black and should of stayed black, they changed the character and they do **** that is stupid.*EDIT 2* I am not a troll, I have seen the movie, and I hated it, worst movie i have seen in my life, i would compare it to a freaking movie of bread cooking movie, it is that boreing, i dont see how anyone could like it and to some of you positive commenters who brought up how wonder women was a femenist film, IT WAS BLOODY NOT A FREAKING FEMENIST FILM, IT DID NOT SHOVE POLOTICS DOWN YOUR THROAT AND THEN SAY IT WAS A MOVIE AND DIDNT HAVE A ACTRESS AND A STAFF WHO SAID IT WAS, IT WAS A MOVIE THAT TOLD A GOOD STORY WITH WONDERFUL CHARACTERS THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL IS THE BLOODY CAT, AND EVEN THAT ISNT ENOUGH TO SAVE IT IN MY OPINION OF GIVING IT A 0 IT **** ON BLACK MEN, IT HAS A WORSE PLOT THEN A 8 YEAR OLD COULD COME UP WITH, THE STORY IS JUST A MIDDLE FINGER TO MEN IN  GENERAL, THE ACTRESSES PREFORMANCE IS AS STALE AS A BLOODY CRACKER THAT HAS BEEN OUT FOR 2 YEARS.",0
216,The biggest Letdown there has ever been for a marvel movie. Brie Larson acted terribly emotionless and dull through the whole movie. Waste of time and money.,0
217,"Omg i nearly slepped in the cinema...The worst marvel film with boring and not interesting story. Even action is terrible, just like visual effects and everuthing else",0
218,42 year old white dude here! After first seeing the trailer for Captain Marvel a while back it look mediocre at best. I am a single dad with sole custody of my daughter and our tradition is we have seen every Marvel movie together. I don't express my political views and I certainly don't like when Samuel L Jackson one of my beloved actors expresses his views by using foul language. Furthermore I don't appreciate Brie Larson white dude comment. Now that the above-mentioned is out of the way here's my honest review. Captain Marvel sometimes resembles the kind of low-budget sci-fi like Critters in the time when this movie is suppose to take place. But Critters had a better plot and the bounty hunters were better. Compared to Marvel movies Ant-Man is better than Captain Marvel. I don't want to give away any scenes for those who wanted to see it but the only good part of the movie is a cat but the end credits don't take anyone's word for it they are cheesy with what the cat and does. Because what the cat does you're going to be asking yourself why and how. And also in the incredits I don't like how Marvel is trying to make Captain Marvel Superior to any of the other event Avengers that have built this franchise up over 10 years it's a slap in the face to all fans and Disney has done to the Marvel franchise what they did to the Star Wars franchise two thumbs down. Because of this film I have doubts about endgame. My doubts were solidified when I Googled information and discovered that the Russo brothers did not want Captain Marvel in the infinity Wars or in game. I discovered online reading through some articles that Captain Marvel was forced into the role and did not get along with the Avengers cast. If you want to go see Captain feminism by all means go see it if you like Ghostbusters with all the women in it then you might like this movie too.,0
219,"Poor script that seems to follow a cookie cutter approach that result in a movie struggling to live up the hype, not helped by the wooden acting from larson, one would imagine the amazing samuel l jackson could atleast balance the movie out but he is not given much to work with.Action scenes are hard to follow and most of the movie you are spent wondering what is going on, to only have it be revealed by exposition.Given the highs of the series such as captain america the first avenger it feels as if this movie has fallen flat by attempted political commentary over substance, while marketing itself as a landmark moment for feminism (sorry did these people claiming this not see wonder woman?).Given this movie could have worked if elements were toned down, better editing was placed in to make it flow better and larson given acting lessons.But we all know this will be ignored and blamed on trolls and males.",0
220,"Dissapointing bs, cat is funny, CM is annoying. So sorry for the character of Samuel L. Jackson, they ruined him.",0
221,"Hi, Russian Troll here. All this fuss was about THIS? The movie is just SO blad and forgettable! I can't believe that MCU undermined an entire decade of build-up just to force feed Endgame with such an underwritten, cliche Mary Sue-ich character. And Camembert Larson... man is she unlikeable! And implying that this movie is somehow groundbreaking? Uhmmm... ever heard about a small phenomenal movie called Wonder Woman?",0
222,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Brie Larson is destroying the MCU. They should fire her soon.,0
223,"Brie Larson is a massive disappointment as Carol Danvers and undermines the overall quality of the movie. She delivers lines with no emotion or depth and is made so overpowered in the MCU that it undermine preestablished characters. She never faces any real challenge or threat, and never reacts believably or interestingly to any situations, usually maintaining a blank or a somewhat angry expression. This has to be one of the worst Marvel Movies ever made. I hope Captain Marvel doesn't ruin Endgame.",0
225,was pretty meh. nothing special. cat was ok. not worth the money. cant wait for Ant Man 3,0
226,"worst marvel movie ever. poor script, poor story, boring. and of course, the cringe is strong in this movie.",0
227,This is by far the worst movie in the MCU Franchise.  I can't believe theyAre you injecting This sort of nonsense into Their movies.  Go back to listening to the fans and making good movies.,0
228,"There have been great superhero works with political satire, overtones in the past- some of the best, even- The Watchmen, Dark Knight series, Maus, The Invisibles, the list goes on. But Hollywood and Marvel have decided to take many of people's favorite works and turn them into PR for the elite establishment- the exact opposite of what the greats I listed were- which were skillful underground challenges to that establishment. The last thing the world needs is superwealthy people taking classics loved by working class and poor people, and telling people how 'real people' are supposed to view them- this is hypocrisy at it's most gross level. It will not last- and no doubt, films like Captain Marvel will mark the low point when the real creatives will emerge, coming out with another generation of great works challenging another establishment pretending to set the bar when really they are just building an artistic prison full of them- wrapping the myth of the transcendent hero in regressive cliche.",0
229,This has really made me not look forward to Endgame.  Captain Marvel is the most OP superhero I've ever seen.  She's basically superman with no kryptonite and shoots beams out of her hands rather than her eyes...,0
230,"Awful script replete with continuity mishaps and poorly explained character motivations Dreadful pacingForgetable score- save for horribly implemented licensed musicCaptain marvel lacks a true character arc, ending the film without any growth to speak ofFight scenes are terribly directed with numerous jump cuts (when they even show the action and it doesnt take place off screen)Worst marvel cinematic universe filmSkip it",0
231,"This is a bland, meh mess of a movie. As a lead-in to End Game it's both inadequate  and unnecessary. Brie Larson is miscast (Opportunity missed for Katee Sackhoff who would have killed in this part). Marvel history is disrespected. Just a sucky disappointment. This spoils the anticipation for End Game. Sad.",0
233,It was exactly what I expected it to be.  +1 point for the CGI which was ok.,0
234,After this movie my only hope for the MCU as a whole is the inclusion of the x-men so Rogue can put Danvers in a coma...,0
235,"Worst MCU movie, including Ang Lee’s Hulk. It was and absolute chore to sit thru.  If you must see it, wait until it comes on Netflix.",0
236,"I've liked Brie Larson in other films, but she showed ZERO range in this. When your main character in a superhero movie is unwatchable, you already have a problem. In addition, Captain Marvel has no weaknesses, which kills the tension immediately. There is no point at which you feel she is in any danger of losing, or any danger at all for that matter.It's an OK origin story, but it makes no sense as to WHY she's supposedly so powerful.The cat was good.",0
237,"I wonder what all the ""you're anti-women"" complainers would have said if MCU had made a standalone Black Widow movie, which would almost certainly have gotten a 10 from everyone who gave this a 0 or 1. Scarlett Johansson has conveyed more personality in one side-ways glance than Brie did in this whole movie.",0
238,"Lo unico rescatable de esta película es Samuel Jackson y la escena post créditos, como película de origen deja mucho que desear, muy decepcionado, no recomiendo verla.",0
240,"As Marvel Universe fan I must say that the tittle for this film should be ""Captain Emotionless"".",0
241,Sad to say but this was the first marvel movie I would tell you to stay away from. The actress has the range of a wooden board and is extremely overpowered and overcomes NOTHING. Hopefully this movie does not ruin Endgame and the MCU.,0
242,"A truly boring, dismal movie. The superhero genre may be in a rut, but this one just goes through the motions.",0
243,It kinda makes me sick to my stomach that Marvel pandered to leftists instead of making a good movie....,0
244,"Worst! marvel movie ive seen, what a waste of time and money, Go see Alita! she is a strong female that plays an excellent role the plot and story are amazing",0
245,"Went with a friend to see some good action but slept for at least 1 hour. The rest was mediocre at best but for me the entire movie was built upon Brie Larson's real life agenda, not on the Captain Marvel character. Boring, bland, political and insulting towards real MCU fans. Will go watch Alita instead and I suggest you all do the same.",0
246,"Boring, uninspired, slow. Keep your politics OUT of movies, games, and TV shows. It's really getting ridiculous.",0
247,"They've made a Marvel blockbuster that, like its central character and actress Brie Larson, is entirely free of personality.",0
248,"Marvel/Disney, please, save the MCU from Brie Larsen.  Let us leave her politics out of it, like she should have while promoting this movie, she is a poor actress and this movie suffered because of it.  I know there is a lot of hate going on surrounding this movie because of comments she made but I went in with an open mind to see this movie.  It just wasn’t good.  Sam Jackson was top notch as always but he alone couldn’t save the film.  The story and acting, on brie’s behalf, just weren’t up to the MCU standards all the previous films have set.  People go to movies to escape the bs going on in the ‘real world’ every day, be it politics, society clashes, blah blah.  Just make good films and stop hiring people who for one can not act and secondly care more about promoting their own agenda instead of the actual movie they starred in. I hope End Game follows tradition for the MCU and doesn’t set captain marvel up for a huge role in the future of the MCU or else everyone will suffer; the fans and your bottom line.",0
249,"This is by far the most boring and bland movie in all the Marvell Comic Universe. The feminist tone feels forced and the main character doesn't have any flaws, it's ridiculous. If they use her for endgame, I feel like she's going to defeat Thanos without sweating a drop, why wouldn't she?",0
250,"Bland acting, Soundtrack was decent but with some cringy moments, the photography of the movie was ok, the plot was mediocre at best with really terrible use of overused tropes (amnesia, really?), larson looked more like a support than a star of the movie, and the political agenda of the movie as a cherry on the top makes me really regret giving this movie an actual chance, avoid it at all costs",0
252,"I thought Brie Larson would be the worst part of the movie based upon her acting in the movie clips and trailers. But I think the writing out stunk her performance. Yes, Larson was terrible. She has no unique style or charisma and is quite bland and not worthy to headline a big budget movie that needs the audience to actually care about her character. The combination of misguided, amateur writing, and Larson's bizarre acting, made the Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel character seem like a hollow, impossible to relate to robot. And that's saying something when it took Anthony Daniels like 2 minutes to make C3P0 interesting in Star Wars A New Hope. Even the radio controlled R2D2 was a more sympathetic character than Captain Marvel.Yeah, I know Larson is getting bashed harshly, but I'm not going easy on the critique because of that. She was playing a heroine, but came across like Sean Young's Blade Runner replicant or Kristanna Loken's T-X from Terminator: Rise Of The Machines. As I watched the movie, I couldn't stop looking at Larson like I would a car wreck. It was surreal and creepy. I'm not familiar with her acting but surely she does not act like that in every movie. But as I said, the story and all of it's many bad ideas was the worst thing about the movie. Marvel & the writers made their first misstep by setting it in the 90s all so they could retcon the MCU's past and make Danvers the first Avenger. The movie seemed to drag forever and contrary to reports...NO ONE SHINED IN THIS MOVIE!! Sam Jackson's Nick Fury was supposed to be younger but he seemed like a tired old man. Clark Gregg should have been used better. The bits with the cat were one of the worst things in any movie, EVER! The finale was like watching Superman VS The Riddler. I can't even call that a final fight. I am amazed that Marvel would make such a bad movie, even though Doctor Strange, Spider-Man Homecoming and both Ant-Man movies were flat lined bores. Infinity War was vastly overrated. But Captain Marvel....so bad it's possibly worse than Iron Man 2 and Thor 2.",0
253,"Katee Sackhoff would have been a better castin choise for Captain Marvel. Brie Larson acts like a Cardbord cutout, and the Character has no arc. It is not interesting to see an orgin story with not seeing the Character grow. Iron Man had his learning time, Captain America was a sick Man who wanted to serve his people, Black Phanter  had to fight for his Place, Ant Man was a criminal who stood up to fight for the right cause. Every Character from the MCU had a struggle, and anyone had to grow up.Not a good thing to do because you want to inject a new player into a full established universe, and i am worried about Avengers: Endgame now.",0
255,"Movie was just bland, generic, overhyped, boring to watch and it's safe to say that this is marvel's version of green lantern or even worse. If you complained about brie being emotionless on the trailer then she's pretty much like that in the whole movie. It's sad that they rewrite captain marvel into a feminist and propaganda machine rather than a superhero that we all can love. This movie could have so much potential to be actually good but no let's prioritize politics over everything else, we can't let captain marvel be vulnerable so not to anger sjw's/feminists. The only saving grace for this movie was samuel l. jackson and without him I would had already fallen asleep of boredom watching this movie. Wonder woman heck even Alita is way2x better than this piece of turd.",0
256,Sam Jackson could not save the movie. Carol Danvers felt like an actress pretending to be a badass superhero.,0
258,"bad direction, bad acting of brie larson, bad script, bad cgi. There is not much to be saved.",0
259,"I am not a bot. I am white female in her 40’s.I have watched MCU from the beginning and have loved the journey. At the end of the movies, I have felt that I watched something that has left me feeling, excited.Well, that did not happen today when I saw Captain Marvel. I felt flat and indifferent. Carol Danvers was the same at end and she was in the beginning. Carol did not inspire me at all. Carol was boring. I was never invested in carol Danvers at all. Sure some parts were ok. Nick Fury, Phil Coulson, Maria Rambeau, Monica Rambeau were great characters. Yon-Rogg or as I will call him Yawn-Rogg.If fact pretty much the whole movie is a yawn.The fight scene with No Doubt’s I’m just a Girl  music choice is sad. They could have gone with Pat Benatar’s Hit me with your best shot. After watching YouTube (yes I know) I discovered that one of the first Captain Marvel was a woman of colour. Why, did they not cast a women of colour. Black Panther showed the way to inspire people, me included. But, no they missed a huge opportunity and went with a safe bet on a white woman.If you want to see the mid credit scene, don’t waste your time. Watch the mid credit scene on YouTube. I am hoping the rumours are true and Marvel has a alternative version where Captain Marvel has a minor part in Avengers Endgame. I am nervous about Avengers Endgame that the powers that be have destroyed a decade of Marvel movies to satisfy a minority. How about create a great character that happens to be a women.",0
260,"This is MCU's worst movie, no wonder its came out early March. Brie Larson as Captain Marvel falls flat, boring and uninteresting. Wonderful performance by Samuel Jackson but the rest of the cast is blah. Now waiting for Avengers:Endgame to wash this Captain Marvel stench off me.",0
261,"Boring, weak script, weak acting skills, just another bad movie about superhero. Just pass by this crap.",0

267,"This movie has nothing of vallue to entertain. Forced retcons, horrible first act, Larson looks and acts like a wooden plank, narrative doesn't flow. Since now they look to be more interested in pushing an agenda than showing love for the comics and its fanbase, I'm REALLY concerned for the future of the once beloved MCU...",0
268,"Я надеялся на хороший фильм, но увы.Второстепенные персонажи интереснее главной героини, они перетягивают все внимание на себя. Так же не понравилось как некоторые актеры играют, возможно это из за плохого сценария . Но смотреть скучно, не затягивает. Тупые шутки, которые не смешные. Фиминистический настрой фильма очень сильно проявляется.Зря потратил деньги на фильм.",0
269,"Horrible movie. The main character is so dull, entitled, self-important and can do no wrong. For instance, she finally learns to fly for the first time and show no excitement or enjoyment over the feat! Captain Marvel: ""Meh, I can fly. Doesn't surprise me really, I can do anything after all."" Good grief, even Superman in Man of Steel was as excited as a kid in a candy store during his first flight. Honestly, if you are looking for a strong relatable female main character, go watch Alita Battle Angel or Wonder Woman instead.",0
270,"Captain Marvel is the miserable spectacle of an abusive aristocrat with a chip on their shoulder talking down to a servant audience, smugly demanding credit for delivering such a valuable lesson. A sad yet seemingly inevitable outcome that, flush with the success of the MCU, Disney now peacocks with an air of moral authority, their bulging coffers a testament to their cultural acumen. Agree or be banished from the house of mouse!",0
271,"Sorry but for a Marvel movie this is too much. The only good thing is the 90s references (cause I love 80s/90s era movies), the cat, and Samuel L. Jackson. Don't waste your time and money as it probably won't tie in to End Game.",0
272,Terrible. I'm here in part because Rotten Tomatoes continues to delete my comments. This movie is boring and just plain bad. Don't waste your money.,0
273,"This movie just awful, I wish I saved my money, what a let down, and that's beside all the political agendas being forced down your throat. The main actress is just so unlikeable and generic, her performance is just awful, I don't know how she got this part. The movie boring and dull, the movie literally changes the entire Marvel narrative just to force the movie just before Endgame, like the name ""S.H.I.E.L.D"" wasn't even concieved when Iron Man 1 aired, but suddenly it's there, they barely had any intel on Aliens, now suddenly Aliens always has been part of the narrative, which was never the case. The made Nick Fury a little side kick **** who goes around flaunting and giggeling, are you kidding me? Nick Fury, the bad ass boss of all the bosses, the guy no human ever messes with, Jesus Christ. Ofcourse this fits with the SJW feminist narrative, which this movie is about. This movie is not even a real movie, that's the thing, it's just a cringy SJW feminazi fest that forces their disgusting and poisonous agenda down your throat, it's just a cover, so they can blame the sexist and racist pigs or the trolls incase the movie bombs, which is literally what is happening.The movie is absolutely garbage, Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern is literally better than this.",0
274,Brie Larson is just plain boring. This is the worst of all the Marvel movies so far. How is she going to be the center point of the MCU after this????,0
275,Too much poison in this thing and I am listening to others enough to know it would be bad for me.,0
276,"So disappointing in every aspect. Bad acting by Brie Larson, the feminist messege flat and gone wrong, Captain Marvel not well introduced and the special effects lame like 10 years old.Though I liked the cat...",0
277,"Well Marvel finally messed up. I have seen all MCU movies from one to three times each in the theater. I wanted this movie to be good. I though that maybe it's just the marketing. Well it's not. The movie attempts to establish Captain Marvel as the biggest and strongest hero in the MCU and falls flat on it's face. If she is to take over for Tony Stark and Steven Rogers I am genuinely concerned for the future of the MCU. Brie Larson lacks Robert Downey Jr.'s natural charisma and Chris Evans's charm.The only good thing about this mess is the Stan Lee tribute and Samuel L. Jackson is as good as always. And Ironically for a ""girl power"" movie the men steal the show. Jude Law and Samuel L. Jackson put Larson to shame.This movie is very unfaithful to the source material on the level of Green Lantern. Brie Larson is horribly miscast. She has zero range and at best a smug demeanor. Someone of the caliber of Emily Blunt would have been a much better fit. The great friendship the two ladies share is just not believable and the dialogue after Carol goes missing is cheesy at best. The Skrulls are wasted. The Skrull invasion is one of the most interesting stories in Marvel comics and now that door is shut forever. The way Nick Furry lost his eye is just ridiculous. And the way the Avengers got the name is just pure cringe. All white man in her past tell her to quit because she is a girl. Mar-Vell, the original Captain Marvel, is gender swapped to be a woman. At first she is held back and by the end of the movie she is the equivalent of Superman. Carol Danvers has NEVER had this much power.The claim that she is the first female super hero is absurd, as if Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, Wlizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch and Evangeline Lilly's Wasp don't exist in the MCU. The marketing pushed this as a feminist movie and it is at the expense of story and character development.TLTR: Skip it. If you are a normal movie fan you will be bored. If you are a comic book fan you will be foaming at the mouth",0
278,"I knew it is a feminist film before going to cinema but I can't believe how horrible they did it. They twisted the plot and characters to just force you to see some feminist propaganda. (mild spoiler ahead) Woman can stand up by herself, don't need man's critics, become very powerful after self-liberation that will scare off even the powerful men. Men in the movie is either enemies (some said it is the patriarchy the true enemy here, they are certainly insightful) or waiting-to-be-saved sidekick. Those who read the comic will realize how far the director went to retell the story. Disney has ruined Star Wars and Marvel. And it is really sad because they have forgotten what made Marvel popular.",0

282,"I bought tickets for myself and my wifes boyfriend and we went and watched it together. Whereas he couldn't help himself from being sexist and badmouthing the movie and spouting misogynist rhetoric (gosh I wish I knew why my wife loves him so much), I actually had a great time! Brie Larson does an amazing job at smashing the patriarchy in this bold movie and its portrayal of a strong female lead for the first time in cinema history.Definitely do watch this, but don't bring your wifes boyfriend.",1
283,"THIS IS A REAL REVIEW:Captain Marvel is a film that has a lot going for it. Being the first Marvel movie of 2019, and the last movie in the lead up to Avengers: Endgame. So I'm gonna start with the good stuff first. The soundtrack is really good, the more techno aspect of it reminds me of Thor Ragnarok, but really scaled back. The CGI is pretty good throughout most of the film, especially Samuel L Jackson's de-aging CGI. The story is broken apart so that the film goer gets snippets of information at times, which is an interesting technique, but eventually became a bit repetitive. The Stan Lee cameo was fantastic, and a great callback too. Outstanding performances by Samuel L Jackson, and Ben Mendelsohn. Now onto the bad, the cast is a little bland at times and due to the run-time of the film there isn't really a whole lot of time for the average film goer to solidify a connection to the characters. Larson who plays Captain Marvel is really stiff at times, and isn't really all that likable, as towards the later parts of the movie she comes off as extremely cocky. On top of that the film has a lot of dry humor, however they don’t give the time needed for most of the laughs to land, literally a second or two more would’ve been enough. In the end, Captain Marvel is a decent flick, it has flare where it needs it and that’s it, it’s a pretty good superhero movie with a lot of minor context for the last 10 years of the MCU.",1
284,"Better than I expected. This will probably get a lot of downvotes because of fat crybabies behind their mom's pc but hey, I liked it. I don't agree with Brie Larson's political agenda, yes, but it didn't seep into the movie fortunately, so I'm judging the movie as a movie. The soundtrack was amazing, Ben Mendelsohn killed it and Samuel L. Jackson was amazing too. Brie Larson didn't really feel like an oscar-worthy actor in this movie, although I did think that of her in Room (2015). The script was also pretty great. Just a good movie.",1
285,"I rate Captain Marvel a solid 9. It has gotten mostly positive ratings from critics and is on track for a massive showing at the box office. There is much to like about Captain Marvel. I see why Brie Larson was selected for the title role; she is an amazing actress, and an Oscar winner to boot. Brie's acting, while inconsistent in some areas, was great overall. Samuel L Jackson was memorable in his role, and an excellent anchor for the film. The other actors and actresses were generally good. Also, a poignant moment was a great tribute to Stan Lee. Captain Marvel had humor (particularly goose!), a compelling story (although I thought a few aspects of the story did not add up), intrigue. I would recommend seeing it at least once. After seeing Captain Marvel, I am even more excited about seeing Endgame.",1
286,"This is one of my favorite movies of 2019, one of my favorite Marvel movies, one of my favorite superhero movies, and one of my favorite movies of all time. Brie Larson's leading performance as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel was stupendous she was funny, serious, and awesome. Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, and Lashana Lynch also gave fantastic performances. I loved Goose the cat aka Goose the Flerken he was cute and awesome. The visual effects were spectacularly incredible especially the de-aging of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, all of Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel's powers, and Goose the cat when he used his abilities as a Flerken. The makeup and hair styling was terrific especially on the Skrulls. The costume designs were amazing especially Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel's. The music featured in the movie was wonderful but sometimes the songs didn't quite fit the scenes they were in. The writing, story, and screenplay were great. This was an A+ movie.",1
287,I don't understand the negative reviews!  This is a great origin story with depth not to mention a great feeling of 1995 when they get there.  The acting is top notch and the story is deep.  Go see this in 3D … one of the best ever!,1
288,"Honestly, I'm REALLY impressed by the film! Quite possibly the most motivating Marvel film I've seen in years.Acting was great, story was thoughtful and detailed, CGI was the usual marvel AWESOME.Carol Danvers is a true superhero (bordering on overpowered) and it was refreshing to see Nick Fury joke a lot instead of being his usual-grumpy.Looking forward to seeing Avengers Endgame!",1
289,"Good addition to the overall Marvel Universe.  Overall, the movie ranks in the middle for me in terms of Marvel films - most of which I have loved and a few were just meh.  I think it was better than Black Panther but not as good as Thor Ragnarok or GotG.  Sam Jackson's character was superb and Brie Larson was good enough to carry this movie into Endgame next month. I'm sure this movie will get low scores from people who just want to bring it down based on their personal dislike for Brie Larson.",1
290,"This is the movie that true comic book fans have been waiting for! Captain Marvel is awesome! The plot has no holes, the visual effects are good, the acting is on point. Could not ask for more, Marvel got over it!",1
291,"Awesome movie, awesome performance from lady Larson, Samuel L. Jackson is amazing as always, love them together, great chemistry. The movie look amazing and the 90's nostalgia is real. Top 5 best marvel movie for me.",1
292,"Disclaimer: I'm not putting a spoiler tag because I don't give out story points but I do mention moments, tones, acting and reactions so please thread lightly if you want to go with a clean slate wich I recommend.So just came out of the movie (it came out the sixth here) and I can say this is not a female agenda movie! I'm a male and I loved every bit of it. There's a couple of scenes that reminds us this is a girl granted but these are very subtle or used for somewhat comedic effects, but for the most part male/female is interchangable. She could be a man and the story would be basically the same, so it's a non issue. ( I make this point because of all the controversy, but rest assured it's all bull)This is a troubled hero trying to find what it all means and Brie Larson plays it very well with subtle tones, a crescendo of roguish attitudes and humor that reflect her inner turmoil. The trailers don't make it justice at all. Samuel l. Jackson is at its best minus the profanity and the deaging thing is mind blowing to say the least. The banter between them flows so well. The supporting cast are scene stealers all of them. Maria, Monica, Talos, Coulson, Jude law, Annette and the freaking cat. The action scenes are riveting, well put together and the finale! In the words of doctor Bruce banner, you guys are so screwed now! The beginning gave me a heartache (you'll see) and the first endcredit scene got cheers from the public. The story is one of the best in any shm, I was glued to the seat for 2 hours and change but it flew by. And it's funny, more than I expected, with that MCU signature humor. Again the trailers don't make it justice.Now, I gave this an 8/8.5 ( have to watch it again if I'm keeping the 9 or downgrade it to an 8) rounded to 9, but it's a 8.5 because it tries a little too hard to include scenes tying to the larger MCU where it didn't need them. The movie stands on it's own merits and it would be slightly better without the ""see what we did here wink wink"" moments.Overall it goes to my top ten easily and one of the best most unique origin stories in the mcu. Highly recommend to see it. I plan to see it at least one more time as I mentioned.",1
293,"(Ignore the user score. The trolls are in hard for this movie. I'm sure this comment will get thumbs downed like crazy)Captain Marvel is excellent! Brie Larson is much more expressive in the movie than she is in the trailers, which is what my main concern was (not some political remarks).The movie is fun and bright, but to my surprise knew how to take itself seriously. One of my major complaints with Marvel films is the overload of Bathos (all jokes, all the time, no matter the cost). I think that this is probably one of the best Marvel solo films since Iron Man 1 or Winter Soldier.",1
294,"This was a very good movie. I liked it better than Ironman 3, Thor 2, and Age of Ultron.",1
295,Fun addition to the Marvel universe. Some parts (and dialogue) are just okay but overall the action and heart makes up for it.,1
296,"Great origin story, it starts a bit slow but after getting to Earth the pace catches up. Loved the acting from everyone, especially Larson, who channels perfectly the frustration of the character not remembering anything from her past. Go watch it now!",1
297,"Fantastic movie, Samuel L Jackson is awesome and so is the cat.  Ben Mendelsohn looks a little uncomfortable in prosthetics but still kills it.  Brie Larson goes from unthinking killbot to actual human being and is a fantastic actor.  Thanos is screwed.",1
298,Great addition to the Marvel universe. Brie Larson and Sam Jackson were fantastic. Don't pay attention to all the trolls.,1
299,"In a time where character introductions might as well not be the best place to put especially if it is being released after Avengers: Infinity War and despite what so many aggressive people think about this one, Captain Marvel stands as its own movie even if the film does have its biggest weaknesses and that is most likely something unusual to see but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has suffered from these movies a few times before they started to make great movies afterwards so I guess that could be understandable from a certain point of view.",1
300,"Dunno, why so hate. If issue about the feminism, so what's about Wonder Woman? It was more about feminism, but people liked it. Situations from these movies: Wonder Woman has fell in love and become a super hero because she's a woman - meh, Captain Marvel, the person who believed in herself, and become a hero - classics. I am not fan of SJW, but really, Larson showed a strong person, a human who never give up. THE HUMAN. Yes, there were some punch lines about manwoman rivalry, like in real life.About Larson's acting - it's cool. She's funny and attractive, real girl with character.",1
301,"I was skeptical because the trailers were pure trash, but this is a pretty fun, if slight, MCU origin story.",1
302,"This movie is great fun and I'm gonna watch it a second time for sure. My expectations were really high and it matched them. Brie Larson plays a refreshingly unpretentious Carol Danvers, much more like a Guardian Of The Galaxy rather than an Avenger.",1
303,"Its a good movie, with lots of twists and turns. You can't able to guess who is the bad guy until the end. The movie is slow in the first half, but the other half is what makes the movie watchable. The origin can be improved. But still a very good movie to watch in theater",1
304,Obviously good as an origin story. Brie is an good actor. And played well as carol. Fury and other character were fun as well. Story was full of turns and mainly the source of her energy was revealed good,1
305,"Captain Marvel is a necessary addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and doesn't have anything to prove. Brie Larson is marvelous as Carol Denvers. Based on the movie reviews, it seems that a lot of people misinterpret Brie's recent comments about male critics. Sad.",1
306,"Integral to the MCU, and a must-see for Marvel and sci-fi fans in particular; and comic book and cinemagoers in general; especially those who lived through the 90s. Performances are great, the whole cast is exceptional, and the hero characters are great role models. Larson killed it as Carol and the titular hero, and I can't wait to see more of her in the MCU. The movie's so much fun. Direction, cinematography, filmscore, action, humor, emotion, vfx, editing were all great. There're hilarious moments as well as emotional, powerful, and empowering ones too. The movie's full of surprises and unexpicted twists, and carries important messages. There're a Stan Lee tribute, his signature cameo, a significant mid-credits scene, and a less significant post-credits one, but you should see it. Absolutely worth a second viewing. Go see Captain Marvel as soon as you can! You'll most definitely realize that once isn't enough!",1
307,"Captain Marvel was an absolute blast! I found Brie Larson perfect as the cocky, self-assured Carol Danvers, and the film didn't go the way I expected based on trailers. Sam L Jackson is, as always, a hoot, and Goose was the MVP. I also really enjoyed Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn's characters in this film. I have been waiting for a Carol Danvers film for quite some time, and while the film does appear formulaic its a formula that works! I'm very excited to see what Carol brings to Avengers: Endgame!!!",1
308,"Spoiler free review.I went to the cinema yesterday and me and my friends had a really good time watching this movie.Much like many of the other superheroes in the marvel cinematic universe, I didn't really know much about them before watching the movies, and that's the case with Captain Marvel as well. I was happily surprised by how much I liked her as a character, what she stands for, her super powers and now I just want to read and watch more of her.I had such a big smile on my face during most of the movie. I laughed and cried and sometimes both at the same time. Since the movie is set in the 90's, it has plenty good of callbacks with both music and other nostalgic moments that I won't spoil here. Growing up as a teen in the 90's, I was humming along (inside me, I don't disturb others in the theater :p) to many of the classics songs that I remember fondly from my youth.Without spoiling anything I just want to mention that the special effects and CGI in this movie are simply superb!Marvel has made so many good superhero movies over the years, and Captain Marvel is just as good as the others that came before it.So if you liked any of the other Marvel movies, or in general like superhero movies, there is a high probability you will like this one as well.If you are tired of superhero/marvel movies, then this will probably not change your mind.I'm really looking forward to what comes next in phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and what Captain Marvel will contribute there.",1
309,"Brie Larson interpretó a Carol Danvers de manera espontánea, le queda de maravilla el personaje y los haters que están empecinados en rechazar esta película porque el tráiler no les llamó la atención o en el caso mas lamentable de que su protagonista sea mujer cuya actriz tenga determinadas convicciones y que su aparición haya sido tan repentina en el UCM deberían de dejar esas cosas de lado y animarse a ver la película, vale mucho la pena y si creían que el tráiler mostraba demasiado, pues se equivocan, es toda una aventura muy divertida y adorable de principio a fin, el 3D está buenísimo, trae muchísimas sorpresas y referencias tanto del UCM como de la cultura pop de los años 90 y el emotivo cameo de Stan Lee, ni hablar de la escena post créditos.Esta demás decir que la inmensa mayoría la encuentra mala por que siguen dejándose llevar por el hate jajaja",1

314,"I wish I could get my money back. I almost fell asleep a couple of time during the projection, I kept my attention just because I didn't want to miss any piece of useful information leading to Endgame. Brie Larson is terrible, the plot was meh and the writing was **** On top of that, the editing is really bad, the first act is terrible. Some scenes were so cringe that me and my friends laughed. Samuel L Jackson did its best, but one side-character can't save a bad movie. Worst Marvel movie, even worst than Thor 2.",0
316,"this movie was such a disappointment, it was full of plot holes, the de-aging of Sam Jackson was impressive but he is still old so when he ran, or had choreographed fight scenes it looked slow and very clumsy. The plot made no sense at all, the twist at the end made no sense and Brie delivered a dreadful performance. She looked uninterested and didn't convey emotion through the screen, I felt like I was watching an actor playing a character. The whole Nick Fury eye thing was so disappointing. the movie felt rushed and under developed, there were so many instances of plot conveniences like earth tech from the 90s fixing alien tech. it also ruined MCU continuity by having all of this set in the 90s, like the shield acronym, or that back in the early MCU when Thor was introduced Fury and shield were surprised, but they knew about Alien shapeshifters. It had some funny parts, the VFX when she goes binary looked amazing but it couldn't make up for a terrible script and bad performances.",0
319,"I didn't think it was possible to make a movie worst than the new Ghostbusters, well I was dead wrong...",0
320,"Boring, flat, with not so subtle propaganda.. Avoid this one. Really makes me question the future of the franchise.",0
324,I would not recommend watching this movie to any one at all! Brie Larson is the worst person marvel could ever cast for this roll. she is such a horrible person.,0

328,"Pretty poor. In a choice between this and Green Lantern, I'll be watching Ryan.There is a reason that she is named after a cheese.Effects were OK.",0
329,"What redeeming quality can be found in this cringy cheese fest, well the effects are fairly good, that apart, this film has more plot holes than a Swiss Cheese, the story line stinks worse than a ripe Casu Marzu, has less body and substance than a good Cheddar and is as artificial as those nasty pieces of rubbery plastic they put on burgers.Why all the cheese comparisons I hear you ask? Well from start to finish this film is CHEESY and I don`t mean that wholesome parody fun type of cheesy but the lazy writing, idiotic acting and ludicrously over entitled main character that undergoes no hero journey, achieves no epiphany, has little to no empathy and shows no character growth throughout the film, in short Brie Larson could have been replaced by a wooden manikin and nobody would have noticed...""There is a reason that she was named after a cheese"" is perhaps the best summing up to date and the inspiration for my review of this cheesy waste of time, at least a real Brie is delicious on some toast unfortunately this Brie is already past its sell by date...YUCK!",0
330,"CGI and over power doesn't make a good film. It was like Marvel version of justice league. She could just fly through whatever she wants to destory. There wasn't any display of fight IQ or heart, something you see in Captain America or Iron Man. Just a girl who won the ""over power"" lottery without any character depth.",0
332,"Everything in this movie is bad.The story, writing, acting, special effects, everything is just awful. I can't remember a good thing about it. And Gouda Larson sucks, why did they bother with her. It's even not funny at all",0
334,"After the hype that was pent up for the reveal of Captain Marvel, I can say that I was excited to see the characters introduction. I had ignored most of the red flags in commercialization and marketing that had already made me skeptical, and I had never heard of the character of Captain Marvel, so I went in with a clean slate. However, much to my dismay, I knew as much about Captain Marvel when I entered the theater as I did leaving the theater. The protagonist Carol Danvers/Vers herself is an incredibly boring, emotionless mary sue character that would continue to catch second breaths for 2 hours and 5 minutes with forced and ridiculous plot twists that are nothing more than hypocritical allegories for illegal alien immigrants attempting to make their way to a safer home and the big bad white government wont let that happen, forced feminist messages and agenda both in the movie and in advertising with stereotypical men with exaggerative dialogue that would make even a veteran wince in embarassment, and various plot holes and inconsistencies that occur throughout the movie that create unnecessary questions about characters already established in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I thoroughly enjoy seeing badass woman in media like KOS-MOS, Ellen Ripley, Samus Aran and even Black Widow. But Carol Danvers/Vers is a very monotonous, controversial character that would much rather subvert expectations with a straw man theme of ""Getting back up"" and a movie full of amazing CGI but a lack of subtlety in terms of engaging characters other than Talos.",0
336,"Not my favorite Marvel film, but I still enjoy watching it. I don't know why this film is getting review bombed, but ok.",1
337,"While the movie has all the flash, polish  and expert special effects you would expect, the writing is so full of plot holes I feel like I needed a ball of yarn and two knitting needles while I was watching it. Captain Marvel, sorry 'Carol', herself is so OP in this movie that she breaks the entirety of the MCU. She could have stopped Thanos in about three seconds which is why she was absent for most of Endgame. She ruins the continuity of the entire Marvel Universe and makes every other hero in it utterly pointless. The movie itself has no character development outside of 'get stronger'. There is no emotional reaction to regaining her lost memories, no emotional reunion with her very best friend. No emotional fallout from learning her teammates that she trained with and trusted her life to were actually Evil Bad Guys who had deceived her for 6 whole years. There is no emotional growth of the character of Carol what so ever in the entire movie. She just 'gets gud' at being an all powerful god-like ex-human in the space of a few days. Seriously Marvel? You throw away a decade of deep and enthralling character development and world building just for one mediocre movie about a hero so OP she can't even exist alongside the MCU in general without mucking up every other aspect of the franchise?And no, this is not about her being a 'her'. The character is weak because there is no Hero's Journey for her to go on. She makes no mistakes, learns absolutely nothing besides 'punch harder' and in general has no journey at all, let along one worthy of a hero who learns and grows through adversity and self reflection.I did enjoy the cameo by Clark Gregg/Phil Coulson, and Samuel L. Jackson/Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn as Talos/Keller provided a much needed shot of character in this characterless film.This film was a 0 for me, giving it a 2 because the supporting cast carry the movie and nothing with Jackson and Mendelsohn in it should get a 0.",0

351,"Main character selection was really bad. She can't act, she can't cry, she can't laugh... All characters -heroes, villains- were shallow and undeveloped. Fun to watch, but doesn't leave anything behind. Marvel is beginning to rely too much on green screens, and less on stories. Please remember that Stan Lee wrote and told stories.",0
352,"Decided to fill my only gap in the MCU over the quarantine, and what did I get?Larson's smug snout and constant overacting. Bland inconsequential stereotypical story with one twist that is seen from miles away. Main character is a cardboard cutout with inexplicably way too much power. As per the norm with Marvel bubble gum movies, this lacks any directorial style, the action fails to generate a drop of adrenaline, and the editing is messy. The story of how Fury lost his eye is diminished to some lame joke. Coleson's involvement is minimal.Law, as usual, performs well, but lacks a proper script, and Jackson is one of the few bright-ish spots in this mess. How did it get a billion?",0
353,"Brie Larson delivers a decidely dead-pan take on the superhero archetype, one that leaves the audience goer wondering if she even wanted to be there at all. During the film she has many action scenes that she claims in interviews to have done herself but upon repeat viewing and outside evidence this appears to not be the case. She claims to wan't to make a movie for ""everyone"" but in the next breath she **** on 40% of the population and dismisses their point of view with an offhand valley girl-esque remark. I wonder if her portrayal of Captain Marvel is a response to how she views 'patriarchy' and that her ""resting female dog-face"" has transformed from just being a bad aesthetic into an entire character. Brie Larson as Captain Marvel is the resting **** of comic book superheroes and as such deserves a low rating, much lower than the corrupt critic-class will give anyways.Cheers.-Some **** Loser White Guy",0

Bad plot, bad acting, which is surprising as Larson has shown excellent acting chops in other films, so perhaps she just wasn't bought in, or had bad direction.I put this squarely as an 'airplane' movie, that is, one I wouldn't watch in theaters or on netflix/streaming, but one I would watch on a plane if I had nothing else to see, which is, incidentally, how I watched it.",0

362,"At best, Captain Marvel is a so-so film, featuring some decent acting by Jude Law and Samuel L. Jackson. Having Stan Lee reading a copy of Mallrats' script for his cameo was great, given the 90's setting. However, it's clear that the film was made with very little care to the continuity of the MCU.A few examples:* S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were referring to the agency by its acronym in the 1990's in this film. They had been using the full name of the agency until the events of Iron Man, in the 2000's* In Captain America: Winter Soldier, Nick Fury stated he had lost his eye as a result of trusting someone. His eye was lost due to being scratched by a cat in this film.* The Post-Credits Scene clearly did not happen. The Avengers were taken totally by surprise when she showed up in Endgame. Had she shown up as depicted in the Post-Credits Scene, they would have likely been expecting her.Essentially, I don't even count the film as being part of the MCU. While Captain Marvel's appearance in Endgame is absolutely canon to the MCU continuity, this film clearly just didn't match up.",0

369,"Boring and inconsequential, with hard to follow action and a wandering plot. All of it weighed down by dull acting from the lead. Honestly, is Brie Larson wearing a mask that's incapable of showing emotion? In the rare moments when she does anything but stare, she comes off as nothing but smug.One could forgive some of this if the story had any connection for the audience. It's not a ""Hero's Journey"" story or an ""underdog"" tale. You just wonder how far her already existing power can go. Dull and forgettable.",0
370,The plot is all over the place Captain Marvel is a Mary Sue with no character traits besides being always right and arrogant for the sake of feminist being happy. Her arrogance is never treated as a flaw because again she’s always right and it doesn’t help that Nick Fury is dumbed down to a sidekick role and only serves to make jokes and get beat up and the way he loses his eye is beyond a cheap gag and insulting to the character we know and love. Ronan had no reason to be involved except to show how high and mighty CM is. And the movie even states she’s nothing without her powers which is beyond true but then we get a cheap moral done lazily so she wins. What should’ve been an action filled battle with her partner was treated as a joke throwing away all respect I could of had for this movie. The Skrulls being good guys wasn’t foreshadowed at all coming out of the blue for another cheap and mishandled message this time about black people. Overall Captain Marvel was an insult to the entire MCU and I’m disappointed Captain Marvel didn’t die in EndgameEndgamenowhere,0

From the involuntary groans I made with every boring second she was on the screen, the canon that 15 years of ncu has built be taken away, everything. In this atrocious film, S.I.E.L.D. supposedly was only created after this incident with the Kree, but it was also created in the 40's in every other movie and tv show marvel has produced. The fault was on disney, but mcu allowed this mess to incorporate their name so they are not out of the blame. Every ""twist"" was predicted, the the trailer showed every scene that you needed to see to know the plot (or what was supposed to be a plot) was going to be lackluster at best and offensive to people that have been waiting for Endgame since IronMan at worst.

396,"Captain Marvel is a de facto poor movie. It feels like it was written by a 16 year-old. The dialogue is not credible, the acting is bad, the music choice for combat scenes is mind bogglingly bad, and the plot itself is mediocre beyond belief. Carol Denvers, the protagonist, is a hero that receives her power undeservingly, out of sheer luck. She was at the right place, at the right time, and that is it. For a plot that seems so fixated on making the protagonist seem like a warrior-spirited inconformist that dares to challenge her own limits, that is frankly lame and anticlimatic. The supporting characters are terrible. In one scene, her friend, a normal human being, having just witnessed an ALIEN BEING that shapeshifts, tells the ALIEN BEING that she'll ""shove her foot up his ass"" at the slightest provocation. Again, in an effort to make the characters (especially women) look ""badass"", some ridiculous situations are created, and the result is not ""cool"", but precisely the opposite. Nick Fury is portrayed as a fool, which I don't think is the result of deliberate character sabotage here, but should be attributed to abysmal writing instead, really. Again, it's like a movie written by a teenager. That also explains how the writers choose to portray how Fury loses his eye. The questionable event is better explained not by malice, but by sheer incompetence. Brie Larson, the actress playing Captain Marvel, is quite uncharismatic, and God knows her character needed someone with charisma to save the Captain from all her arrogant one liners and unbridled ""asskickery"". The movie has no actual villains, since by the time the antagonists finally reveal themselves, Captain Marvel has already ascended to godhood (this is not an exaggeration) and is capable of wiping out entire alien fleets of battleships without dropping a sweat. Alien battleships actually warp out of her presence and towards the other side of the universe, in order to escape Comet Woman Who Shoots Death Photon Blasts And Flies Through Space at Lightspeed Unscathed. When the movie finally ends, it leaves the audience feeling cheated out of any hint of tension or suspense, and thus of adventure, in what was supposed to be an adventure movie. But Captain Marvel is not an adventure movie. It's a movie about someone who gets progressively more powerful, until, at the end, the character transcends the rules of its own universe, and not a single damn is even possible to be given about the character anymore.",0
397,"I was pretty disappointing in this film. For all the hype I saw, it really fell flat in plot and pacing. Jackson did a great job supporting, but overall the film felt cookie cutter. No chances were taken in this film, and I ended up bored in the end.",0
399,"I'm a big fan of Marvel movies but unfortunately this one didn't keep the bar high enough. This time I have to say that DC did the better movie with Wonder Woman. Brie Larson was also not a good a cast as Gal Gadot was for Wonder Woman. Also I would probably rate the movie abit higher if Disney/Marvel would keep politics and agendas away from the movies. Sick of all the SJW in the industry today. Bring back the strong female characters like Sarah Connor (Terminator) or Ripley (Alien) those characters should be the role-models, not Brie Larson.",0
400,"Meh.Didn't want to believe the negative press but, turns out it was 100% accurate. Nothing to do with Brie Larson or feminism though, it's just a boring movie. Over-powered characters rarely do well because they are REALLY hard to write for. ""Punch, wham blast"" stories just devolve into a tedious litany of increasingly daft action scenes which lift you out of the experience. Larson obviously made a conscious effort to express her character as someone on the autism spectrum which I don't think works here; needed a lighter touch. When a character is so powerful, it's important to project vulnerability (think Clark Kent in the context of the first Superman movie) and Larson's Marvel is just too ""perfect"". Hard to empathise with someone so one-dimensional and this comic character desperately needs empathy to stop her just being boring.It's an okay ""popcorn movie"". I probably wouldn't change the channel if it was on TV but I won't buy the DVD/Google Play copy for this one.",0
401,"The first trash movie in the MCU. Brie Larson is as Cpt. Marvel, arrogant and unsympathetic as she is in real life statements.The story is horrible, the acting of Brie Larson ridiculous.She acts like a B-Movie villian, not a AAA super hero. The story is lame, the CGI weak, the acting doll-like and endeavored seriousness.Brie Larson is a complete miscast as Cpt.Marvel. It is unsympathetic and has no potential for identification. Emily Blunt would have been a much better choice for the role, but Disney has opted for an actress who understands neither the character nor the MU and rather invites her with her questionable theses to racial thinking.Good Job Disney! Very Family friendly!About the manipulation of the Box Office by Disney and its affiliates regarding Cpt. Marvel, let's ignore it. It speaks for itself and the confidence in their character and the franchise.One can only hope that Disney comes to his senses as soon as possible and re-staffs the character of Cpt.Marvel, with an actress who is not politically indoctrinated.",0
403,Not really a good movie. Captain Marvel has nothing that hasn't been done better by many other movies.,0
404,"This movie wasn't terrible but was far from good. Sam Jackson nails it as always but feels more of a sidekick in this movie when compared to the badass in Avengers. the plotline was overall very predictable and nothing really impressed or surprised me. Mar-Vell was a joke, Goose was awesome and the de-aging CGI was honestly phenomenal. in all honesty this felt like a needless movie lazily written just to capitalise on Infinity wars popularity Hopefully the Ruso brothers can fix the character in endgame.",0
405,"Sadly the weakest MCU movie to date... The cat and Nick Fury are okay, but the rest ohh my... A slow and boring movie. Weak story, stiff and uninteresting main character (is she a robot?), soundtrack is dull. This movie could have been so much better!",0
406,Too dark. Brie Larson is doing her best with a lukewarm script that can't decide what it wants to be. Cat was amazing. Fury was good. Not a good Marvel film. I honestly feel like the franchise propped this film up on the Marvel brand. I can't argue that it is a financial success but I feel cheated out of my twelve dollars.I would recommend waiting for this on DVD or streaming. Save your money.,0
407,"I can't believe anyone who is an MCU fan would think CM fits into the finely crafted Marvel Universe. A cat monster can touch (internally) the Tesseract? Really?Where was the Tesseract before Mar Vel had it? How did she (yes, that's right, Mar Vel is now a she too) get it from Howard Stark?Now, the story...Marvel doesn't have writers on staff that could do any better than this? Come on! Why do all of our favorite Marvel heroes have a hard time to get to hero status, but CM has not one challenge? Not one?  Where is her character building? Oh, that's right, she didn't need character for this film.  If this had been a stand-alone movie, I would have rated it at maybe a 3, but trying to squeeze this into the MCU, no. No way.Lazy writing, almost like they had no idea who Nick Fury was. Just make him act like some regular Joe off the street, not the bad ass we fans have come to love.I am all for powerful women, but the childish attempt to make ""man bad - woman good"" comparison just turned out LAME (the writers must have forgotten about Wonder Woman and her success). Run Ronin, Run! Give me a break.So much to say...I will leave it at: If you are a casual movie goer, and have no investment in the MCU, this is a great way to burn a few dollars and hours. If the MCU means anything to you, this will tear apart some core understandings you have had since 2008. Good luck with that.",0
408,"I wanted to like this film despite captain SJW's bigotry, however her underwhelming performance coupled with mediocre story telling (by MCU standards) left me seriously concerned for Endgame. The marketing for the film pushed the feminism propaganda so far down my throat that it was hard to enjoy the movie for what it was, or wasn't in this case.The action set pieces were phenomenal to be fair, but that's to be expected by a AAA studio like Marvel. Plot wise there's some interesting scenes that provide some context for the upcoming endgame, but aside from these two points there's no other redeeming qualities.If you want to see a strong female lead, do yourself a favour and watch Alita: Battle Angel. At least Alita doesn't deviate too far from it's source material as to alienate it's core demographic, which is something that Brie Larson managed to do prior to the movie even coming out.",0
409,"Komme gerade aus dem Kino und muss sagen, absolut uninteressant und super langweilig :(Hatte mehr erwartet als 1 1/2 Std. ödes Origins gebabbel und 10min. miese Aktion.Jude Law verschwendet, Samuel auch nicht gerade Weltklasse und der ""Humor"" war auch überhaupt nicht meiner...",0
412,"The main character is portrayed by a big SJW and probably feminist that has a bad opinion about ""White males"" which is still racist and stupid even though she is white as well . For someone who wants to promote equality she has an unhealty hate for a type of man . This hate is unhealthy and can be visibile during the movie which is very predictable , you can guess the ending by watching the first 15 minutes of the movie . Also Disney is trying to silence bad reviews , like that`s going to work .",0
413,"Brie Larson only smiles a couple of times in the movie and I actually like those few moments, unfortunately the direction must have been for her to have a stick up her ass for the rest of the movie though. This movie will ""Empower"" those few individuals in the universe who have a magical engine blow up and give them magical powers. Conflating the Skrull with the world's Refugee problem won't stop a single wall from being built; Jude Law could have been replaced by a ""male"" robot, his character was terrible and should have been called male oppressor 01; A movie this boring doesn't warrant all the attention it's getting.",0
414,"Was looking forward to this film but it was a disappointment for me. The movie has no sense of unique style like each of the other Marvel character solo films. The music is okish, but still barely holds a candle to some of the scores from other recent Marvel flicks. I found many of the action scenes to be overly cliche and just plain boring and predictable. Half the jokes fell flat & writing overall was just bland and forgettable. You can skip this film before Endgame don't worry you aren't missing much!",0
415,"The worst Marvel movie so far... the ""villain"" make me feel really weird, and plot is not amazing, the captain herself feels way tooooo powerful that makes her basically invinciblelike another guys said, this movie makes me worry about Endgame",0
416,"This movie is nothing special, it is yet another superhero movie that has the same tired, boring, and awkwardly paced storylines that have plagued most superhero movies in recent memory... and there in lies the problem, there is mass fatigue set in with these MCU/DC movies because they get pumped out every year or so, and while there are great ones mixed in between, the majority of these movies just blend in with one another and Captain Marvel suffers the same fate.Brie Larson, regardless of her politics, just did not bring anything to the table, I don't know what it is about her because I know she can be an incredible actress, but in this movie, she seems to be so wooden and emotionless that it's hard to tell if she is trying to come across as stoical or this is not a role she was suitable for. I haven't seen her enjoy a role since 21 Jump Street or Room.The rest of the cast is borderline forgettable, I enjoyed some of the buddy talk between Danvers & Fury, and there were some fun quips between them, but beyond that I struggle to remember parts of the movie I thoroughly enjoyed because I could just see where the plot was going and it wasn't enough to captivate me. I honestly caught that feeling of waiting/hoping for it to end so I could see how this movie will connect to Endgame.In all honesty, outside of Civil War, Infinity War, Guardians Volume 1 & 2, and Homecoming, I have not enjoyed this 15 year stretch of MCU movies because I feel like there were just too many and that a superhero movie is only gonna go one way. I don't want to delve into a plot analysis because I don't want to ruin any potential spoilers for people who want to see this, but it was a tad too predictable if you consider previous origin story movies.+ Great visuals+ Fun moments between some characters+ I can still appreciate the theme of motivating girls/women to achieve their goals and go beyond their limits- Brie is not at her best in this role- Forgettable characters- Predictable plot- Awkward pacing- Predictable character arc for Danvers (no weaknesses)- Terrible marketing campaign- Some hamfisted political themesIf this was any other Marvel movie I had the same complaints about, it would be a 4 or 5, but because this movie seriously lacks fun and interesting characters, has the same blueprint as every other superhero film, and decided to politicize its marketing campaign based on personal feelings and ideologies, this a solid 3 for me.I have no doubts in my mind that this film will do good in the box office, every MCU film does usually, but for the love of entertainment, can we please just leave politics out of movies and their promotions? I think it would be great for younger girls to see this and takeaway the fact that they can pursue their dreams like anyone else, but when the overarching message is that White Males are the problem and we should see them as the bad guys, then this will set a bad example for them in the future.Also, side note, while Metacritic has not been too terrible with the purging of troll reviews like other sites (something about a tomato) based on user scores, if you're going to delete the reviews that give 0/10 (which I totally agree should be deleted) that are made by trolls to trash the film and its ideologies, then why is it okay for the 10/10 reviews that people leave to ""balance them out"" remain on here without even seeing the film... There needs to be consistency, not hypocrisy.",0

418,"Boring and Uninteresting character,the worst Marvel movie,script confused,a movie to forget",0
419,"I just felt that this movie was hastily put into the universe and poorly written. A hero devoid of any weakness. A hero impossible for any mere human to relate to. Tony Stark, Thor, Dr. Strange had to struggle with ego or had to be humbled but battled through it. Scarlet Witch had to see the error of her ways that revenge was not the solution. These ""heroes"" became larger than life because they inspire us to better OURSELVES and not to overpower other people. This movie doesn't benefit the story that took 10 years to make and I certainly think that MCU didn't just took 10 years laying the groundwork and foundation just to put this new character above all the other characters that has earned our respect through all this time.",0
420,"Brie Larson was miscast as this hero. She gives an incredibly dull performance. I cannot believe this woman has an Oscar. She also wears a terrible wig in the film. The dialogue was cliche. The editing was confusing. The plot was disastrous. There was nothing memorable or exciting about this film or performance from Brie. This absolutely is a terrible movie. The studio can't pay everyone to lie that this movie was good.  It was so disappointing. I am so shocked at the decision making of this film. The direction, acting, and script was terrible.",0

423,"Nothing to write home about, bland, uninteresting; not what I'd expect from a Marvel movie. The 90s nostalgia was nice, the supporting cast did a reasonable job in spite of the lacklustre writing and I liked the cat; but Brie Larson's performance (if you can call it that) was wooden, emotionless and boring and she spent most of the movie looking bored herself; sort of how you imagine a terminator would look when there's nobody left to terminate. In fact, the Terminator franchise might have been a better choice for Brie.",0
424,"Total Bore, Total disrespect to to Nick Fury's history. Watching Brie as Cap Marvel was like watching paint dry. Looks like the end of a great MCU run",0
425,SLJ and the cat are the best parts of this movie.  Brie Larson's acting is just... bland at best.  A sophomore in a college drama class could have done better.  Let me summarize her acting -_-  Hope that doesn't count as a spoiler.,0
426,i'm not big on superhero movies and this one didn't help with that.it was boring most of the time and brie's acting was so bad that i cringed.but the worst thing of all is how they got captain marvel's cat to scratch out nick fury's eye.,0
428,"Wanted to love this movie but was disappointed.  The story was weak and the direction was horrible.  It would have been better without the random memory puzzle to show the backstory. I would have preferred they start with her origin and work chronologically but we get a poorly edited mess showing her memories from Earth.  These memories are a simply a vessel to clumsily make her seem a victim but none of that is relevant to the story.  By the time they get around to telling the real story, you don't even care about her.  I never left during the whole movie yet constantly felt like I missed some major pieces of information to explain what was happening.  Either they edited out important scenes to make room for boring coffee break chats or they chose a poor writer and director.  Larson acted with the range of a brick. Not once in the entire movie do you feel she is in jeopardy.  Apparently she never had a family and only one dull pilot friend that somehow gets screen time but serves no purpose in the story.  The actor playing the main skrull is the best part of the movie.  SMJ is okay but he doesn't seem at all like the Fury character in any other MCU movies. It's like the writer had never seen any other MCU movies.  He was good but his personality was inexplicable.  I pray they don't make CM the main character in Endgame.  With the way they powered her it would be a 10 minute movie ending in a 3 second battle.",0
429,"Skip this, and honestly, probably Avengers End Game as well. Recap in one run on sentence... Apparently this random woman with a boring backstory is the first Avenger, she's been gone for awhile, shes the most powerful (for, reasons?) she has no weaknesses or a likable personality and she will be single handedly saving the actual Avengers and most likely defeating Thanos with feminism. yuk. Nick Fury was dope tho. The cat was way more likable than Brie. Her acting is as cheesy as her name.",0
431,"Poco atractiva. De una vez iré diciendo que si he sido de las personas que critico en su momento a la película por el recurrente feminismo que la rodeaba pero no por que fuera una película con referencias a este movimiento por Gal Gadot y WW lo hacen muy muy bien pero ¿Soy el único que noto que cuando la capitana hablaba con un hombre que no era Jackson era muy agresiva? eso denoto bastante el feminismo que la rodeaba, quitando eso fue horrible la parte final que no voy a relatar pero eso de hacerla tan poderosa por una explosión  como lo hacen en la pelicula fue una estupidez, no tiene coherencia y en realidad lo único que me mantuvo despierto fue el gato y la limpia actuación de Jackson pero cuando salia la capitana llegaba a aburrirme del rostro que tenia de querer acabar con todo ya, el CGI es muy feo en algunos casos y en otros es buenos pero el maquillaje da asco, tras escribir todo esto no se si bajarle a uno, esto no merece ni un poco la calificación que dan los críticos.",0

437,"Terrible, decepcionante, insufrible y exasperante. es lo que pasa cuando un estudio pone el mensaje feminista por encima de la historia y el guion. La pelicula esta llena de bromas que no aterrizan, dialogos sosos, e incomodos momentos diseñados para demostrar que los hombres son los responsables de todo lo que esta mal en la vida de la protagonista. Los efectos visuales no tienen nada de especial, es lo mismo que hemos visto los ultimos 10 años. El maquillaje es terrible y puede ser comparado a un episodio cualquiera de Star-Trek. Pudieron haber explotado mucho mejor las habilidades camaleonicas y la intriga causada por los Skrulls, en cambio abandonan esta linea antes de la mitad de la pelicula. La parte media de la pelicula es aburrida. Hay muchos agujeros en la trama, la personaje principal tiene poca motivacion y pasa de 1 a 10000 de poder  demasiado rapido, practicamente sin merecerlo y sin buscarlo. Capitain Marvel es una Mary Sue hecha y derecha, parece que sus peleas y escenas de accion estan diseñadas solo para hacerla ver invencible y son aburridas. Es incomodo ver como los villanos quedan impotentes ante su mera presencia y no pueden mas que admirarla y temerla. Samuel L Jackson carga en us hombros la pelicula con su actuacion y muy necesarias intervenciones comicas, aun asi la pelicula se encarga de hacerlo ver tonto, descuidado e incompetente. Brie Larson no tiene carisma, pero aparentemente tenemos que hacernos a la idea de que tenga una aparicion salvadora en Avengers EndGame.",0
438,"It's just a long, bland, ""whatever"" filler episode of Agents Of Shield with a guest star Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury). The production team didn't care about the movie and the actors just wanted the paycheck.",0

The main character doesn't emote, struggle, or grow.  She's pretty much a Mary Sue.  After seeing leftist agenda destroy Doctor Who and Star Wars, it looks like the Marvel Cinematic Universe is going to die slowly too.  One of the worst Marvel movies...but you can't say that or else people will straw man you and say you just hate women.",0
442,"Disjointed and often nonsensical plot line. Shallow characters. Long, uninteresting ‘action ‘ scenes. Only thing that kept me watching was the admission I’d paid.",0
443,"Even though repeating some tiring flashbacksssssssss, Captain Marvel still struggling to know herself but remembering her past (that irritatingly repeated flashback) instead, character itself still unable to prove how strong she is and what she capable of despite of pushing away and flying through Ronan's ships and the DC styled eye glowing scene are annoyingly intimate. Satisfyingly surprised with its humours and the smooth connection to End Game timeline. It's not the best MCU movie, it's good but it's below average of MCU movies, it can be worth watching if you really thinking of how Captain Marvel are connected to upcoming Avengers End Game.",0
444,"Plot holes everywhere, contradicting previous Marvel movies.The character development is absolutely terrible, it's actually worse than some random anime. Carol faces no struggle (unless you consider playing baseball as a girl a struggle), and the shocking plot twist that's supposed to be life-changing gets wiped away after 5 minutes, all while her acting/expression conveys little emotion and is unnatural. The ""hero"" gets unlimited power for basically no sacrifice, struggle, or hardship, if we compare her to the likes of Ironman or Thor or Captain America.The boss fights feel like I'm watching Dragon Ball Z. She suffers DC Superman syndrome, you can leave all other characters at home and the result of the fights will be the same. The main character considers herself as some savior-of-the-oppressed, but only give them fish, while not intending to teach them how to fish.",0
446,"Maybe my mistake was going to the movies with a lot of expectation, I expected more from this movie, because I really like the heroine Captain Marvel and his original comic book story. The name of the film is Captain Marvel, but the one who drew the most attention in the film was Nick Fury and Cat Goose. The only protagonism of Captain Marvel was to destroy Kree ships and a few dozen warheads, I found that destroyed very easy. Ronnan, Supreme Intelligence and Yon-Rogg did not have a villain either, they just did it, did not do anything relevant, did not generate a challenge. Every hero needs a villain in height, otherwise his heroism has no purpose. It seems that the purpose of this film is only to present a character to be used in the movie Avengers: end game.",0
447,"Was not a very good mcu movie.  Her political agenda aside Brie was not good in this role.  She had no character for the majority of the movie.  The character worked best in the 4 or so moments where the character demonstrated a fish out of water trope but these were to few and short to make a difference to her character, which is a shame because they were well done.  Probably were frightened of a Wonder Woman comparison but when Thor did it before Wonder Woman i dont think there would be much comparison.The films Feminist agenda is very present and at times on the nose but it could've been a lot worst.[spoiler]    Im really surprised though that the plot would actually use a sexist portrayal of women.  Captain Marvel is too emotional to control her powers and must overcome them to be able to be in the same league as a man.  At first i thought maybe this was suppose to be a mans negative opinion of her but everytime the plot came about she showed her emotional imbalance.  I've not heard anyone comment on this but considering the negative sexist stereotype of womens emotions holding them back im surprised this would make it into the plot of a feminist movie.  Overall not a great movie but not the worst.  Really worried about Endgame and the future of the mcu as Brie lacks any kind of charisma or rap-our with any character in this film",0
448,"Hi!This movie is boring! It has a character, that has no weakness, has no character development! Bad SGI at the wery end!

454,"There is a curious phenomenon in human psychology where, once a controversy that draws a crowd has a real following, and that controversy gets resolved, the people who's entire personality was wrapped up in said controversy go into deep depression and anxiety. They have little else left to live for. Retired military commit suicide at a high rate because for 20 years or so their entire being was their career. once that is over, what now? Such is the current wave of feminism and this movie shows it from the casting to the writing. This movie was terrible. There is a trend in Hollywood where nobody consults anyone of our hundreds of thousands in the population of veterans when it comes to actual military endeavors. People who have or have had nothing to do with any service branch are the ones who write movies about the military and it truly sickens me. The main theme of the movie is that men keep telling Carol she can't do X so she should give up and she is all powerful and special and MEN need to shut up and accept her as she is, a goddess. The struggle is minimal at best. She didn't lose parents, she didn't overcome an addiction, her siblings didn't try to kill her, she wasn't made sterile by a Russian spy organization to make her a more effective seductress and interrogator. Larson acts as though her entire character arch is an afternoon at the DMV. The villain turns out to be the patriarchy and they should quit telling her what to do - which is Brie Larson's entire real life personality, which ruined the movie. A more talented and capable actress would have taken the role to a better place other than ""I want to speak to a manager"". How does anyone get promoted, especially to Captain, without taking orders? You have to learn to take orders before you are allowed to issue them. One does not really issue orders, at least on a small scale, until they make field grade of Major (O-4). How does someone pass MEPS without taking orders? How does someone graduate Officer Candidate School if they have such a problem with authority? I don't think you can get a VA rating for it but those nail scars might make fighting bad guys a bit difficult. That was a Christ complex joke... because she, and the writers, make her into a Christ figure without the sacrifice. The entire movie is this pretensions BS way of making her a character of convenient perfection who is more powerful than any thousand MCU gods, yet she is a perpetual victim... sounds like the whole of 3rd wave feminism. Captain Marvel is a BRUTALLY shoehorned Deus Ex-Machina with no character arch, no character development, no sense of struggle or sacrifice, no coherent structure as it feels like it was filmed out of sequence, and no real skin in the game because we all know the end result in the MCU time line. It is boring. Why did we need this? Why are we getting a very unpopular character which has been rebooted multiple times in the comics? Why are we not getting Adam Warlock - the character who was introduced three films ago and DOES take down Thanos? They all but ruined Nick Fury. Nick was a clandestine black ops special forces agent from the Vietnam era who's career straddled Military intelligence, CIA, and several other government agencies. For the time line it would have made sense to change the continuity for Desert Storm. THAT is why he was made head of S.H.I.E.L.D. He was THE Tommy Tough Nuts of the Marvel Universe. The guy had so many government secrets in his head, his enemies feared what he knew but feared what contingency plans would be put in motion in the event of his death so much more that they dare not assassinate him. The character they wrote for this movie felt like they wrote Nick Fury for Harlan Williams rather than Samuel Jackson. Nick fury was supposed to have lost his eye during a grenade explosion, not a cat scratch. How OG; to be blinded by shrapnel but still have the fortitude to carry on like a Spartan and become head of the top global military intelligence organization. They F'd up Nick fury and made him into a Dana Carvey Joke. With the Villain being made into a ""straight white male"" and literally the patriarchy, the presumed villains were shuffled down to a secondary plot point and became an allegory for immigration policy. Real subtle. Why didn't Jude Law just wear orange makeup and a MAGA hat. Carol Danvers, AKA Captain Platitude, never went through any sort of character development or struggle outside of ""Muh Patriarchy!"". She was being held down by the man... by a nicotine patch... which she could have taken off at any time... There was no sense that the character had any investment in the world she was in other than the magical world of convenient plot points and mcguffins. The character -and this is telling of everyone who was involved- is the most powerful, strongest, smartest, fastest, prettiest, bestest super hero in the whole wide world and if you think otherwise you are a misogynist stupid man in her way. Hubris. 0.0",0
455,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I simply have no reason to.  Carol Danvers is simply unlikable.  We're given no reason to care for her.  She's cocky and arrogant (like many comic-book super-heroes), but has no redeeming qualities to offset that.  Her stoicism doesn't make it any better.  Imagine Thor without the character growth - where he KNEW he was worthy, no matter what happened.  That's Carol Danvers, and it's off-putting.The action is poorly-paced, poorly-framed, and so ubiquitous that it becomes boring.  Think ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"".  I actually liked the action in Thor: The Dark World more.  Let that sink in.Hopefully the other writers/directors for her next (of seven or eight guaranteed films?) movies will have a more palatable approach.  It has to be difficult, though, when the character is so unlikable.  I don't necessarily blame Brie Larson for this, but she definitely seems to lean hard into Carol Danvers' poor traits.  Maybe that was the way she was directed.  I hope so.  I can't imagine this character, as depicted by Brie Larson, fitting in with the rest of the Avengers.  She seems the type that would have all the wrong kinds of friction with the other heroes.I can't recommend this movie - not even for those few Captain Marvel fans.  Maybe it's just a stumble out of the gate, with the next movie featuring the character being better-made.  Let's hope so.",0
456,"If you're not a fan of the comics, you may end up getting lost in what is going on with this movie.  The storyline does not do well in trying to explain the backstory.  In fact, the plot is just...confusing anyway.  If you are a comics fan, you may end up being put off by this portrayal of what the heroin should have been.Poor plot line, bad scripting, poor portrayal, graphics that range from absolutely fantastic, to absolutely horrible. VERY weak ending.  All said, the supporting cast is the ONLY thing that will carry this movie through.  Their parts are well done, and literally will be all that is worth watching in this film.  May go down in history as a first for Marvel.  The first that didn't fly.Overall, the movie has it's entertainment value.  Will you want to see it again?  I don't.  Will it join your DVD collection?  Not likely.  Does it encourage me to go see Avengers Endgame?  NOT if this Capt. Marvel is in it, I'll pass.",0
457,"A ""meh"" move. It is a 2.5 star movie, but gets rated lower for being an unnecessary cash grab before the release of the last Avengers movie. Marvel should have released this after Avengers Endgame. It is hard to care about any new characters when the ones we already know are in peril. The existence of Captain Marvel makes the events of the prior movies seem less important. You have to wonder where this character was when the Guardians of the Galaxy or Avengers needed help. Why does Nick Fury not care enough about the earth to call in for help in all the other Marvel movies? This movie creates too many plot holes in the Marvel universe.",0
458,Bad acting coupled with a bland and boring script I've never said I wasted my money before on a Marvel movie but today I have,0
459,"Captain Marvel isn't even mediocre, one of the worst Marvel films I've seen. The main actress is the cringiest person I've seen in a long time.",0
460,wrong actress for this role. her comedic moments fell flat. very slow pace & i honestly yawned several times. scrap the writers & recast everyone except jackson & the cat.,0
461,"I’m not a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I think there overrated with some unnecessary humor, and lazy story telling. And after seeing this movie I have to say that movie is straight up trash. There’s nothing fun about this movie to have, it’s boring, has lazy story that does not make sense whats so ever, the humor in this movie is unnecessary at all, and the chemistry between the characters is average at best. 2/10",0
462,"The best part of Captain Marvel is a cat and Samuel L. Jackson. In that order.Visual effects are good, but the direction is uninspired, most scenes feel flat and lack style, and lastly Brie Larson is forgettable and probably miscast. Better to watch Wonder Woman, Kill Bill or Tank Girl.",0
464,"this is just another superheroe movie without emotion, heart, or something that can be interesting in any level, its just average or even less.",0
465,"I’ll putting aside all the controversy surrounding the film,I wanted to watch it with one perspective ,is it a good movie.this character derserved more than what it was given,how she was portrayed was just wrong.over all I couldn’t enjoy it at all.i hope marvel fixes this in the upcoming films",0
466,"A boring, bland movie with just a few high points. Brie Larson was horribly miscast. From past films, she can obviously act, but gives little evidence of it here with her wooden, charisma-free performance. She keeps the same one-note expression throughout most of the film, whatever is happening to her.Captain Marvel has no personality, character arc or growth as a person. She never really seemed to be in peril, which meant there was no tension or excitement in the movie and I never identified with her at any point.The story is corny, the script is poor,(with a not-so subtle feminist agenda), some of the fight scenes are choppily edited and the special FX look cheap. Oh and the much-vaunted cat is a mere gimmick.Several things are clumsily retconned to shoehorn this character into the MCU mythology. These revelations make no sense and leave the mythos all the poorer for it.I gave it credit for the supporting cast, especially Samuel L Jackson who is as good as ever (despite the film absolutely ruining his character) and for some of the jokes.Still, this is one of the worst, if not THE worst MCU film. If Captain Marvel is going to be the face of the MCU going forward, I may not bother with their films after Endgame.TAKE MY ADVICE, GIVE THIS ONE A MISS AND SAVE YOUR MONEY – I WISH I HAD!",0
467,"The positives - great tribute to Stan, that was well done. Now the rest - so I haven't read the comics, I just like the MCU movies. But not this one. There are so many plot holes and inconsistencies to mention, I have no idea what the Kree are or why Ronan is in this movie. I thought the humour was forced. I don't want to get into the whole strong female character mud slinging but will say that Brie Larson is extremely unlikeable in this role, smirking her way through the film. I feel like I only saw this to get my head round why the character will be integrated into the story for Endgame, I'll never watch it again.",0
468,"Of course this movie has all the political **** but even if you push that to the side, Captain Marvel makes a LAZY attempted to make a likable character, and fails.  It's so basic, doesn't follow the OG story of Captain Marvel... uhg this movie just sucks, I was expecting this to be an average movie maybe a 6 out of 10. But no this is a 2! Lazy writing, dialogue basic, lead role awful... Even if Captain Marvel was recast-ed, couldn't of saved this film. Stay away!",0
469,"Very little to get excited about here as the villain is the best character in the movie. Brie Larson is awfully miscast in the lead role and delivers a wooden-plank stiff performance from start to finish. Enjoyable to some degree if you are a comic book geek, but as such, it's probably the slowest, least likable super hero movie since the craze took off more than a decade ago.",0
470,Brie Larson is very wooden.  The adversaries she faces has more charisma.  The final battle is anti-climatic because there is no credible threat.  The CGI around the cat is terrible.  the middle drags and the third act has no stakes.  The retcons around fury losing his eye and captain marvel inspiring the avengers name are pathetic.  Could have been a better film but not well thought out.,0
471,"I'm gonna honest here,i'm not going into expect to trash this movie or hate on Brie Larson.I just want to see a good solid movie,but the trailers didn't impress me and felt so bland,and Brie Larson was so wooden in it,just trailers,the movie might be good.Now,having watched the film myself,i was very letdown by it,not from the storywise or cgi/visual effects(fantastic s*** here,the de aging stuffs are insane),but from the direction, the style of the movie and how the film was executed.The film really struggles to be felt interesting,it starts off really rushed,but i would say that the first 40 minutes of Captain Marvel was pretty OK,the fight scenes was fine,and then things happen in the second act which has lots of potential and it lost me completely from there,and i just waited for the film to end.The film looks so bland and uninspiring,it is like anyone can make this movie,it doesn't have a style of its own.But my biggest letdown with this movie that i was very afraid to tell is Brie Larson as Captain Marvel in my opinion.For the entire movie,her performance is very one-note and wooden,kind like the same character that she played in Kong Skull Island and this came from an Award winning actress??.Also,the treatment with Nick Fury felt so betrayal to the character itself and the after credits scene,eventhough i like it,I just wish i didn't see it,No spoiler here,it felt so predictable to me.",0
472,"boring and rushed. I was hoping for a fun marvel movie, instead I got a boring main character. The best part of Cpt. Marvel was the cat. Hopefully End Game will fix my superhero itch next month because all Cpt. Marvel did was give me a rash.",0
473,I have become genuinely concerned with the film/Creative Industry. In short this title feels completely isolated and lost. This continuous flow of political pandering and playing it safe is hurting Marvel. A brand that has left us with a legacy of characters we have come to fall in love with; building a unique global relationship with the comic heroes. Jackson (Nick Fury) manages to retain any credibility bringing the notes of nostalgia with perfect delivery. Nevertheless the rest seems to fall short in a soulness and lifeless display making the audience feel very little for the cinematic experience and narrative. Unfortuntely my biggest fears were brought to fruition with CM's integration into 'Endgame'. This fundamentally feels like the wrong decision and further highlights the dissociation with the core audience. I would strongly advise others to save their wallets and keep their expectations low which is saddening to say. In summary the Disney affect is not always popular or positive. I hope the collosal void between the 'journalistic' perspective and those that fund these usually great experiences of escapism is duly noted.- Weak Writing - Questionable Casting- Choppy editing and jumps- 3/10 is a fair analysis of this film,0
474,Underwhelming acting performance and script. Any entertaining action sequences were few and far between. Almost no comedy or lightheartedness throughout the whole movie. Forced character development to try to justify that Marvel just made a brand new character who doesn't wield an infinity stone the most powerful Avenger.,0
475,"Captain Marvel is as a weak a stand-alone Marvel movie as it looked in the trailers and advertising. It’s bland, very forgettable and nothing about our lead symbolises this immensely powerful being Kevin Feige told us. It’s probably the worst of the Marvel movies, along with Thor 2.",0
476,"Captain Marvel is a bore. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but it is mediocre at best. I really wish Marvel had done something truly groundbreaking and introduced someone like Ms Marvel, Kamala Khan. But instead we got another generic, white actress who showed no emotional range during her performance. I mean Goose the cat showed more emotional range than Larson in her role. Captain Marvel has been shoved down the throats of comic readers for decades, but nobody has ever really got into the character so it has been reinvented time and time again. Here we have another blatant attempt by Marvel to make Captain Marvel happen, but falls face first due to a lackluster story, two dimensional villains, and poor acting on Larson's part. I feel really sorry for Elizabeth Olsen, Scarlet Witch was dumbed down in strength for the big screen and it's clear she has been sidelined by Marvel for Captain Marvel to swoop in and save the day. But this isn't a character we are invested in, not like Olsen's Scarlet Witch. Marvel had big shoes to fill with this movie, and it simply isn't up to par with other movies in the genre, in terms of visual style, special effects or acting.",0
478,"The movie is very a slow boil. Even when things start getting interesting, it is a chore to stay invested because the leading lady seems so unlike-able. It's a shame, I was really hoping for a fun Marvel movie with a female super hero, but we ended up with this.",0
479,"Ruins the skrulls, ruin the Nick Fury eye history, predictable, the white man is the bad guy.",0
480,"I genuinely wanted to like it, but the last time I saw a performance that wooden from a titular character in a Disney film, it was called Pinocchio. Sorry. It just didn't work.",0
481,"So, Brie Larson will be great as Pinocchio, what with her wooden acting at all. The cat was the best part of the movie, and apparently, Skrulls are good guys now? Also, the soundtrack was great, but I'm Just A Girl was laid over the climactic fight and the tempo and rhythm didn't match what was on screen. At all. And there was a horribly acted and put together flashback montage of ""you can't do X, you're just a girl!"" I'm super anemic, and I'll cry at the drop of an emotionally manipulative story beat, but not one single tear at this movie. Seriously, unless you want to see the most powerful cat in the MCU, don't just skip, this, avoid it like the plague!1 point for Goosee!",0
482,"I wanted to see this movie before Endgame, but after watching it, realized that it is not necessary.  Other than the end credits showing her in Endgame, this movie added nothing.  The movie was completely boring and unoriginal, bland and flat.  The tribute to Stan Lee was excellent, and the story of how Fury lost his eye is totally lame!  Hopefully Endgame will be better than this.",0
483,"If it had been called Nick Fury and Goose, I think the movie would have been better.",0
484,This movie left a bitter taste in my mouth. Brie Larson acting showed no charisma at all. And retconning the foundation of the avengers made me angry.,0
485,"I purposely did not watch an previews or spoilers or youtube videos on this movie because I heard people had said both good and bad things prior to it even releasing. But after watching this movie.... I have to do my first review and say this was just terrible.. The humor was so cringe and frankly disgusting. The animation was amazing at times and horrible at times, making me wonder if it was because this film was so rushed to release at the perfect sales date before end game. I say this because the budget for these movies can almost have no limit considering how much they produce from the film and then the future films because of it, and how much they expected to make from this and the hype train behind it, it should have had no problem investing more into this film. Whomever the main actress was in it was just.... not fit for this role... both acting, and now that I mention it, not physically either. Having someone play your double for your ""behind shots"" is only humiliating when they played the female power thing. Not trying to beat a dead horse and give fire to the flame of ""another sexist white man"", but even when this actress throws a punch at the old lady... it was like watching my friends daughter throw a baseball.. How can a superhero fighter who fights with her hands and wants us to believe she is so strong, and beat up people with her small hands curled forward, wrist bent, and thrown with the elbow. they couldn't even pay a trainer to help her throw a punch that looked believable. The fight scenes were terrible made except part of one when she had the cuffs on. Her story was the same as anyones 100x over, and they didn't seem to care one bit about showing more interest in it or her as a character, which makes me feel the same. Why should I show any interest in this character? everything about this was boring and poorly done, was rooting for the girl power on this one, but afraid it was very disappointing. The movie as a whole, if you've never seen marvel movies or know the story, was probably more of a 4-5 or so, but I gave it a 1 for the fact that Samuel Jackson still had to put up with this and be in it. I had to show him support with a one star at least",0
486,"Unfortunately I wasn't too happy with the pre-marking of this movie which may have impacted my expectations and overall feel for this movie... The theater was almost empty which was strange ill give it that. Anyway... Brie Larson's performance was terrible.. maybe that was the way Captain Marvel was meant to be portrayed? An expressionless individual devoid of any emotion... Glass half full? Nick Fury was and will always be a good character in my mind so obviously I did enjoy his time onscreen and the CGI? haha was actually alright with his face in my opinion. A strange character.. Goose... Ill be honest, I enjoyed watching Goose's antics which was another highlight.The flow of the movie was disjointed and difficult to understand what was going on in the first half of the movie... I couldn't tell if it was the movie itself... I was tired or simply because I was getting a little bored. The 25% of the movie however made up for it I suppose but then again I just wasted 75% of time here.The fight scenes... well... mediocre at best and not memorable. The bad guys? zzzzz again.. not memorable.Upsides? Music.. 95% of it was awesome. I grew up with most of the music and it took a leaf out of Guardians Of The Galaxy which is not a bad thing in this regard (and Thor.. my FAV!)Overall... boring story line... boring and lifeless main character... not exactly the worst movie in MCU but obviously not the greatest. I don't understand how this movie is getting high ratings for? It was pushed in right at the end and was a rush job. Endgame... I certain hope Captain Marvels role is very limited...",0
487,"Too much nonsense in this film, the generic all powerful being that can't be hurt by anyone or anything aside, some of the crap they pulled off here really ruins the continuity of the past 10yrs of marvel films and she's apparantly the new face of MCU going forward?? the fact my theater was not full would speak otherwise, I've never been to an openeing of a marvel film where the theater and auditoriums were not packed, for Captain Marvel however, there were too many empty seats.The problem with the movies is just the forced aspects of it's political messages which they are not shy from shoving in your face whatsoever and it gets real stale after the first 10 times of hearing, I'm better than you at xyz ""cause i'm a chick""some people are saying this film is getting ""hate"" because its lead by a female...yet Alita battle angel is literally an badass female killing machine and the audience score for that is in the high 90's, WW could basically be the poster child for women and her film and audience score was amazing. So you're telling me the same men who loved those female lead movies are now hating on this simply because the lead is a female!? grow up, the film just isn't good and the actress is not likable.Spoilers ahead...one of the dumbest things for me was the fact that they explain how fury lost his eye in the MCU...to the cat in the captain marvel film...SMDHand in end credits she shows up like a troll asking where Fury is in the current MCU avengers universe...",0
488,"The Film did not feel right to me, me and my husband found it very boring and linear.even Thor 2 was better...",0
489,"Captain Marvel is a Mary Sue. Why?The problem is that the Russo's gave Thanos infinite power, he became practically a god so they need a goddess to beat him.But how can you win against an enemy who can see the future? Like Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow? No. They can defeat Thanos only by accident. Because if they are planning, he will know. And therefore there is no need for Captain Marvel. Possible scenario: Thanos take a shower and the cleaning lady enters the bathroom. She sees the gauntlet and think: ""what a  nice shiny glove"" and take it to her kids to play. And Thanos became powerless.﻿Wait! If Thanos can see the future then he will know about the accident, too. Possible scenario v2.0: The Avengers will start a petition in which they ask Thanos to undo the  fingersnap and Thanos, realizing that all the fuss was for nothing, because Captain Marvel is still alive, will accept.﻿",0
490,"I wanted to like this movie. I put aside all of the racism and misandry that Brie Larson has been espousing and just focused in on the character and on the movie, as I love these types of movies. This movie though was just terrible. The Captain Marvel character portrayed was very wooden, and just one-dimensional. The story itself was uninteresting. The whole thing really went down the toilet. I have seen school plays that were much more interesting and entertaining. Nick Fury loses his eye to a kitty?? Please.",0
493,"Brie Larson was such a bad choice for the title role. Truly a charisma vacuum. The highlights of the movie were Jude Law's character, Nick Fury and Talos. Other than that, one of the worst Mavel movies ever.",0

For a hero story the 'climax' should at least imply that the hero can be defeated ... no real climax in this movie, just 2 hours of filler for the MCU while waiting for next Avengers movie...",0
497,"Filme chato, com tiradas bestas e enredo previsível. Para apresentação da heroína mais forte do mundo Marvel eu esperava algo melhor. Não tem ponto alto, são descobertas previsíveis e lutas medianas. É totalmente focado em efeitos especiais, até o que deveria soar ""emocionante"" soa como uma banana verde: péssimo pra comer. Para o primeiro filme solo de uma Heroína a Marvel deixou a desejar, ao contrário da DC com Wonder Woman.Inclusive até em quesito atuação a Gal Gadot se sobressaiu a Oscar Winner Brie Larson, nem parece que venceu Oscar atuando porcamente assim.",0
500,"I wouldn't say this is a bad film, it's definitely not as bad as Iron Man 2&3 or Thor: The Dark World. But, for me this is one of the most disappointing movies Marvel has made so far. The chemistry between Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson is great, the cats cool and the visuals and score are both good. Plus the CGI to de-age Fury and Coulson is amazing That's about everything I enjoyed in this movie. Brie Larson as Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) comes across as fairly wooden and has no weaknesses to speak of, therefore not giving me any reason to care about her. The only character development we get is that she recovers her memories and she becomes more powerful at the end of the film, at no point is defeated or facing a significant amount of difficulty. Her powers don't make sense in how/why she got them and what her limits are, leaving me with a lot of questions on her capabilities. Some of the supporting characters are okay. Fury is okay I guess and the alien cat's cute. Everyone else is either boring or underdeveloped, both good and evil characters.The villains in the film follow the standard Marvel Villain formula of being forgettable and uninteresting, and are brushed aside by Captain Marvel pretty easily.The tone of the film is jumping to about three different ways throughout the film. At one point being like a buddy cop film between Fury and Danvers and then a film about sisterhood between Danvers and her pilot friend (can't remember her name). This made this film seem like different directors tried to make it throughout production and it's noticeable. The scores okay, got nothing against it and the other sounds and soundtracks are all fine.The visuals are also good. Nothing to brag about when compared to the likes of other Marvel films but their good. The main problem in this film however is the retconing and the blatant attempts at rewriting established events in the MCU to make Captain Marvel the number 1 superhero in the franchise. It's so obvious that any semi-hardcore MCU fan will notice it and will be confused as to why the origins (E.g. the origins of the Avengers initiative) has been changed in this film when its already been established.Marvel, Disney and Brie Larson have forced everyone to believe that Captain Marvel is going to be the next leader of the Avengers, the new Iron Man or Captain America to replace them once they're gone, and this was before the movie was even released. Captain Marvel doesn't deserve this position with 1 mediocre film. Now the reason for this film being mediocre I think doesn't lie with Brie at all, she is a good actress, her Oscar award proves that. But it felt that Captain Marvel was shoved into the MCU and given a short amount of time to make, making the film seem rushed and opening a lot of plot holes in the MCU. This isn't the fault of the actress, it's the fault of the writers and those that approved the script for this film. If you just want an action movie with lots of action and visuals, you'll probably like this film. But if you want interesting characters, a good plot or you're just a die-hard MCU fan, you'll probably be disappointed in this film.",0
501,if it wasnt for the stan lee tribute and the cat this would have been a 0. movie was so bland i almost walked out on it. expect so much more from a marvel movie,0
502,Brie larsen was a bad choice for this role.. her face is just so annoying to look at.. the writing is incredibly bad.. the only saving grace is the cat goose.,0
503,"Had this movie not been released in the wake of infinity war down the MCU timeline it would have been mildly mediocre. However the mere presence of Infinity War highlights all of Captain Marvel's infinite flaws. With us, the viewers, overwhelmingly voicing our disappointment while critics shyly praising it, it seems more than ever that the critics credibility is dancing on a knife's edge.",0
504,"I won't lie, I fell asleep during some of the scenes. I also felt Brie was miscast for this role, it didn't gel well with the role. The 90's references and the tribute to Stan at the start was probably the only good thing about this movie. It's not on the same level as Wonder Woman",0
505,"this review is based on my own experience,first off all i like marvel movie's in general, and which is why i wanted to see it despite the SJW-politics, and boy i regret paying money to see this movie in the cinema. the movie is full of cliche's about ''women'' like they act that there are no (have been) ''strong'' women in movie's and thats a lie,(watch Alien) people just want strong characters and not a Racist-cheerleader, that uses SJW slurs, and why is she the strongest character in the mcu? which retard decided that? like there should not be the strongest ''avenger'' at all because why do you need a team then? hopefully brie larson will be recasted, she does not fit in the mcu, she is a racist, and there are other women characters who allready have more depth like black widow, & Scarlett witch who deserve a standalone movie first. and next time keep your SJW-politics out of it",0
506,"While nice to see young Nick Fury and Agent Coulson, the movie is bland and boring. If you are seeing this movie because it ties into Avengers End Game, the only tie in is in post credits. Wait for the footage to leak online. Did live the Stan Lee intro, and one of my favorite of his cameos.",0
507,"Captain Marvel is a humorless slog, with a miscast lead who had to be carried by the supporting cast in every scene. For no good reason, severe retcon's ruin the MCU timeline and future possibilities.",0
508,The Captain Marvel comic books fail over and over.  Marvel reboots it trying to save it.  They thought this would make a good movie?  The only good thing about this movie is the cat.  Don't waist your time.  Don't pay money to see this.  Stay away!!!,0
509,Terribly boring movie. Is this Marvel trying to destroy Endgame? Why so much politics and man hating?,0
510,This was was a waste of time. We ended up walking out halfway through the movie it was too much to take in. This could have been better served as an episode of Agents of Shield. I wouldn't even watch this when it airs on TNT or FX,0
511,boring movie bland acting from brie larson hope this movie flops or i fear this will be the start of a string of SJW movies from marvel,0
512,No real obstacle or character development for an origin story. Nothing here for a marvel fan.,0
513,"Bottom 5 MCU film. Uneven direction, Jude Law mails in a mediocre performance...and Brie Larson is playing herself while giving 3 different performances in the movie. Her character is bland, and uninspiring (unlike DC's WW)...she's basically a Mary Sue in the 3rd act of the film where the action is right down comical. Not so subtle digs at political and social commentaries sprinkled within the film makes it a first for the MCU and not something viewers should want to see.  What gives her the full power...taking off the ""chains of the patriarchy"" you see...oh those evil men who kept telling Carol what she can or can't do. Ben Mendelson is good as always.  Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury is emasculated to lift up Monica and Carol throughout the film. He's basically a side kick that's there to provide humor and is nothing like the Nick Fury the MCU has established before in many films.Special Effects are subpar for an MCU film.Overall this is no better than a 3 or 4 out of 10. A very unnecessary film, shoehorning Capt Marvel in the MCU and establishing her as the ""most powerful"" character b/c hey...Marvel doesn't have a WW and have to compete with DC.",0
514,to be fair the first ten minutes of the movie with the sci-fi was good until we saw Vers? A good chunk of the movie felt very unnersserary 1 Fury lost his eye to a cat 2 skrulls are good? 3 gender-swapped Marvell?  I am not sure what to say I am so upset stay away from this movie just wait for End Game...... skip this movie from the movie theatre,0
515,"Badly written script with lots of plot holes as well as a bland performance by the lead actor means that this movie is not worth seeing. Given how many MCU movies have been made it was inevitable that a less then mediocre movie would be added as some point, this is it.",0
516,"By far the worst of the MCU and that's considering the prior Hulk movies.  There is no main character arc to care about, she is a flat main character, and the fact the NF loses his eye to a cat (which was joked about by fans) is pathetic.  Don't waste your money.",0
517,"I’m not a fan of Cap. Marvel in the comics (poorly written overpowered character), but I was willing to give it a chance on the big screen, considering the great record the MCU has shown us. I thought they would make her more relatable and give her a deeper story.Unfortunately, they gave us a boring movie with slow pacing, forced 90s music disconnected from the scenes, really poor casting choice in Brie Larson (her emotionless performance didn't help either) and the always cringe worthy and unnecessary SJW undertone that ends up ruining good franchises. One would think that Disney learnt it lesson with Star Wars…not the case.There’s no hero’s journey, no development, nothing. Only 2 hours of irrelevance.I really hope Marvel go back to focusing on making good movies, instead of trying to force their misguided feminist agenda down our throats.I really hope they didn’t bet everything on Captain Marvel (bad comic book character, even worst on screen).I really hope they have a contingency plan for End Game.I really hope this isn’t the future of the MCU.",0
518,"Seriously? What was Marvel Studios and Disney thinking? Until now, the MCU has produced success, film after film after film. Even the films that were poorly received, like Incredible Hulk, Thor Dark World, Iron 2, were actually pretty decent. But, to produce a movie that reads like a Gail Simone Marvel Comic spouting social justice, feminism and trying to lecture me that I'm what's wrong with the world? If I wanted a lecture, I wouldn't pay to go see a movie on it, I'd listen to a lecture from my family.Captain Marvel shows that whoever wrote and directed this travesty knows nothing about Marvel Comics and the character of Captain Marvel. The character was originally a male superhero, then the character was reinvented as a person of color, now, she's a crusty white woman who wants to lecture the audience.What pissed me off was that movie depicts Skrulls *NOT* as an alien race bent on dominating the human race but rather they are ""illegal immigrants"". WTF!!!! Depicting the Skrulls as this way proves that the movie is no more than a two hour propoganda movie for feminism, social justice and antifa.Only thing that Marvel Studios did was waste two hours of my time and scammed me out of the $5 I paid to see this crap. The movie was simply yawn inducing, boring and unimaginative. Next time? Make an MCU movie that doesn't scream social justice. If this is the future of the MCU, then I'm getting off this ride right now.",0
519,"I was disappointed in this movie. I went into it with Marvel level expections and they were not met. I thought the story was messy and many of the characters were just...bleh. On the positive side, Nick Fury is awesome!",0
520,I didn't like the way Nick Fury was treated and the main character was too stoic.,0
521,"Unlike the amazing Wonder Woman , Marvel's first movie (unless you count Electra I guess) with a female superhero lead is dull, soulless and bumps the MCU two steps back rather that the promised major leap forward. Which is a shame because all main actors are very talented and have delivered amazing performances in the past. Sadly all the focus on the meta-narrative and the political war surrounding the film (a war most of us neither want a side in nor are interested in ) left botha actors and directors little to no room to focus on actually crafting a good movie to back these up . Both female-led superhero movies and the Marvel Universe deserve much better.",0
522,"Looking at this movie objectively, I can easily say it's not a terrible movie but also not a great movie either.The effects where average and excelled at making Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury look amazing. Sadly, Brie Larson as Captain Marvel gave an average to underwhelming performance leaving a dull impression. It was clear she didn't have the ability to carry the movie on her own and needed supporting actors to even make it work.Unfortunately the story didn't adhere to the pre-established lore in the comics and in fact dangerously deviates and changes one of the best villain races in the MCU. And ends up leaving Ronan the Accuser probably one the cool'est villains in Marvel Movies thus far, feels underused and improperly implemented story wise.If you were hoping for a great answer to the anticipated question as to how Nick Fury lost his eye. Sadly it's probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie with little to no imagination in the execution.All said and done, due to the points stated as well as poor writing and directing. Also considering the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe this movie is slightly below average and a generally forgettable but somewhat enjoyable film.",0
523,"Bland and generic. This is the most underwhelming of all Marvel movies. There is no ""hero's journey"" or character arc. The jokes are cheesy, embarrassingly stupid and forced. The main character comes off as a spoiled brat, impossible to empathize with or get behind. On the bright side Samuel Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Lashana Lynch, and even the cat, named Goose,all give great performances.",0
524,The main adversity the protagonist faces is that she's too powerful... Not kidding.,0
525,"First of all this movie is horrendous. This movie's writing is a total slap in the face to the MCU. All the goodwill that was developed between the audience and the filmmakers just went out the window with all the retconning of lore. The hero has no character arc. This movie tries to be a super hero movie but comes off as a Green Lantern copy cat. It is unoriginal, uninspired and a mess.",0
526,"Really boring and rushed. Terrible wooden acting by lead actress for the majority of the movie. Also, the cringe meter went off the charts when she was beating up bad guys while ""I'm Just a Girl"" from No Doubt played in the background.",0
527,"Dull story, dull protagonist, disappointing villain, mediocre CGI compared to other contemporary movies and action scenes lack absolutely any tension. Movie barely makes up for the laziness and drought of entertainment with a couple of fun supporting characters and (this is apparently a subjective aspect) a few tributes to the pop culture of the 90s and to the late Stan Lee.",0
528,"leaving aside all political matters. This is one of the most ""meh"" movies in the marvel catalog. I dont know, It feels so generic, like the first movies marvel did back in the day. I think the best way to describe it is that you will forget this film half and hour after you watch it.",0
529,"This film is so boring I fell asleep twice.  Formulaic plot, terrible acting by Cheese Larson, average CGI.  Do not need to see this movie as prequel for Avengers Endgame so everyone should skip this horible movie.",0
531,"I am really disappointed- Expected some kind of, or more of conection with Endgame Avengers. Brie Larsen it's not suitable for the role and the character of captain Marvel is very flat written. The film feels overall cheap.",0
532,"Oof, I don't really know what to say. Very slow movie, pacing seemed very off. Brie gave a shell of a performance, she seemed very wooden. When Carol Danvers got her powers, it should have been a great moment, instead it was shallow, and boring.If there was a saving grace, it would be Samuel Jackson. He was spot on as usual.If you're a Marvel fan, you might like this movie, but even then, I'm not sure. It's not vital to the Marvel universe, so this is a safe skip.",0
533,"it's a boring and disappointing movie, bad acting by brie larson, the only good thing is the cat",0
534,"This movie was a big disappointment. I had been interested in it as I am excited for Endgame and that's really the main reason I saw it. However, it let me down. Samuel L Jackson was good but that's really about it. I wish I would have waited to read the reviews online before watching this. Boring movie. Now I question whether Endgame will be the movie the fans have been waiting for or not. Sad day.",0
535,"I came into the movie with an open mind, but I left the movie bored. The story was weak and predictable. Compared to other Marvel movies this was one of the worst. Lighting and fight scenes need more work because they seemed flawed.",0
536,"I have a feeling the lead was miscast in this picture.  If a different choice was made the film might have been greatly improved.  Although it's not a terrible movie, it's not good either...",0
537,"I was kinda prejudiced because of the absolute gorgeous marketing they did. Anyway, my concerns had been proven true. Boring story and unfunny jokes. I think a potato could have been more emotional than Brie Larson. The only two reasons why I didnt gave a 0 were the cat and the cool CGI to make Samuel L. Jackson younger.",0
538,"Well another year, another bog standard Marvel movie. This time with a tree branch in the main role! How diverse!!! Thanks Disney! Brie Larson is here! Watch out Thanos! All the character we've watched and grown with so far, move the **** out of the way! The woman is here to teach us the proper way to wipe the floor with evil doers! This literal Deus Ex completely spits in the face of what Marvel has been building to. Everyone we know, has now been void and moot because Plank and Captain Mellonhead are going to defeat Thanos in the next movie. Nothing was earned, and nothing has been deserved but you better just accept it. Thanks Marvel for making me not care about End Game!",0
539,"Worst MCU film, so disappointed. It fell like a DCU film in my eyes. Brie totally miscast, like a robot, no emotions. But to be fair to DCU Wonder Woman is light years a better movie.",0
540,"I generally like all movies and everyone was making a big deal about this one so i thought its prolly good, just a few things that could be off. Overall a 'meh' movie, main role could have been better and not so divisive. Overall low quality movie. Few side bars with Fury and the Cat that made me have hope but just cant believe this is where they took this movie.",0
541,"The only reason for a 1 instead of a 0 is because of the cat. Other than that, the script was horrendous and the humour was laughably bad. At first, Brie Larson/Vers/Captain Marvel seemed to be a witty and genuinely funny character with her remarks. Where did that witticism go? She was edgy and moody throughout most of the movie, so why introduce her as that?One of the few things that made me fuming was the introduction of Mar-Vell, who was changed from a Kree minority hero to a female Kree Scientist. Why in the world was it necessary to change her origin story?For visuals and effects, I'm glad to say that it wasn't like the rest of the movie. It was impressive and even immersive at times when Brie Larson's acting isn't getting in the way. Onto her acting: she gave Carol Danvers an undeserving bland personality. I get it, she's trying to discover herself and find out who she really is. But that shouldn't excuse the seemingly unmotivated actress to go on set and LARP. Scratch that. I know LARPers who can give her acting a run for its money.The fight scenes were few and far in between. Sometimes, it's not a bad thing to have more narrative in a movie. However, Captain Marvel is the ""strongest superhero"" in the MCU. They should do her character justice by showing off her strength more instead of at a few Skrulls and an AI.Final point: Lack of a real villain. No, it's not the Skrulls (not until the Secret Invasion at least), not Ronan, not even the Kree in this movie. Herself? Maybe. But what was the point of her fighting all of these people/aliens? My conclusive opinion of this movie is a big, fat, 1. For a Marvel movie, I had high hopes they would do Captain Marvel's questionable comic book existence justice by having a lead that was at least motivated to play the part. Her acting was poor and her push for female empowerment on an international holiday such as today did not come through. Wonder Woman did it right. Why couldn't Marvel at least do the same?",0
542,"Watched this movie with high hopes of enjoying another marvel character brought to the big screen. I cannot say that the movie was impressive on any level. From the main protagonist 'unlocking' her powers to the unfunny comedy sprinkled throughout left a bad taste in my mouth. It didn't feel like a true marvel movie, even with Samuel L Jackson's cameos he couldn't save this scrap-heap. Overall quality was lackluster, and felt like another Marry Sue movie akin to The Force Awakens. I still give it a 2/10 for the action scenes... Looking for a movie with a strong female protagonist done right? Watch Wonder Woman. Side note: I came here and made an account in disgust at Rotten Tomatoes deletion of my review along with 54,000 other users who they pruned.",0
543,"An uninteresting, politicized smorgasbord of mediocre big-budget SFX and plot. Bad pacing, bad acting, and bad marketing. This is a movie you can skip.",0
544,the movie offers nothing new. the acting by brie larson is subpar and the highlight of the movie is fury and the cat,0
545,"No Spoilers here, I found the first half the movie very dull, the second half pick up though. To me this was the worse marvel movie of all times, Captain Marvel is presented as a Paragon unstoppable with no humanity and I really hate the way fury lost his eye. I tried to give this movie a chance but I really did not enjoy it. maybe others will though",0
546,"I went in having read many negative views and reviews about this movie. I also read that many voted the movie down because of what she had said about white men. After having watched the movie I understand why the reviews are bad, because the movie is really bad, regardless of anything else, the movie is mediocre at best.",0
547,"Hoo boy is this movie a trying on one's patience. I almost fell asleep during this movie a couple times. I know Brie Larson can act, and I can't imagine that Marvel didn't have the money to giver her a nice big check, so I can't understand why the bad guy skrulls with 10 lbs of makeup on their face can act better than she can in this movie.This movie is better than I expected, but I wasn't expecting much, and this movie still fails to be that entertaining of a romp. I'm admittedly rather picky when it comes to my movies, especially if I'm to be paying 8-10 dollars for a movie ticket, and I'm sorry that this movie came out at such prices. Honestly refunds should be in order.The movie is decent in every way that you'd expect a big budget movie from the MCU to have; the cinematography and colours and other such technical things are on point enough, but the cgi honestly looks very rushed (considering that this movie was likely rushed to come out before the finale, Endgame, releases this isn't a surprise) The skrulls look kinda like the orcs from that one Will Smith movie ""Bright"" although not so stout and slightly different colouration. The movie manages to not look terrible for the most part, but the finale battle looks like a trailer from an early Xbox 360 game from E3 2005. Other than that the movie looks decent enough, and other aspects like Sammy J's Rejuvenation looks completely the opposite. If I hadn't known any better, I would've just said ""Man, Sammy is aging like a friggin' Dorian Gray"" Disney can de-age people like a wizard. Unfortunately where most of the positives stop. The plot fails to have any amount of originality to it, it has nothing to distinguish it in a good way from any other hero story out there. It has a bit of wolverine origins, a serving of captain america, a splash of Wonder Woman, a bit of Green Lantern, a smidgen of spiderman and a pinch of super girl. She's basically all the usual super hero tropes rolled into one bland character. The only times her character has more depth than a trading card is when she's interacting with Sammy's Nick Fury, the only highlights of the movie as they felt very nice and lively (one of the interactions actually made me smirk) It's hard for anyone to be a flat character around a personality like Mr. Jackson, he apparently made Brie forget why she's so upset to be in this movie at least.The plot is also a bit of a mess, it has plot holes and problems that were overcame or explained in such a poorly done manner that they bring up more questions that answers (SPOILER-ish How in the frick does being next to explosion of an engine using the power of the tesseract make the strongest hero in the MCU but Loki using it's power in the first Avengers didn't decimate the team?! SPOILER-ish over)There are secondary characters that also feel very bland, not only because their acting is bad either. No characters are anything other than a plot device save for the Sammy J, and the cat (Both of which characters are made lesser by the twist on how Fury got his scar)The character, Vree is supposed to be the strongest character in the MCU, but she doesn't feel like she's earned it, she doesn't feel like she has any real power, just that her enemies are incompetent as she shows no real struggle and her ""second wind"" is explained by a throw away line that's just horrid writing. This is not the worst movie that the MCU has made, that dis-honor still belongs to Captain America, but it's in the same boat, it's a bad movie that they rushed out just before the big cross-over film was made.It's worth a watch if you really like Marvel films, but it's not going to be anything that you haven't seen before and in fact couldn't have written yourself.",0
548,"Mediocre story at best. Bad screenplay. Very weak acting (by Brie Larson, the others were fine). Too ""forced"" at times. And no, a cat cannot make the difference.",0
549,"On the surface a very generic super hero movie, look a little deeper and it is filled with cringe worth political agendas and retcons that take a wrecking ball through the already established mcu.Nick Fury had his balls chopped off in this ""film"".",0
553,"This movie, while not outright awful, is not very good.  It is easily the worst of the entire MCU.  Larson gives a forgettable performance. Her internal conflict amounts to standing up against some vague memories of ""the white patriarchy"" keeping her down. Every time she's on screen you look for some other supporting role to relieve her.  Literally every other character offers more depth to their roles and to the movie overall. The movie would have been better if it had focused on Nick Fury as the main character and chronicled this event as a part of his past.  Larson really doesn't bring anything.",0
554,"Meh movie. The story telling is disjoint and doesn't work very well. And occasionally weighted, down by an attempt at bland and misguided political message. Main character is unrelatable, unemotional and overpowered. The movie is somewhat saved by some of the supporting cast that sometimes deliver something interesting.As one of the enemies says once to Captain marvel : 'I never really liked you' the heroine never really become a character you hope succed... I felt bad for the evil space general when his entire fleets missiles gets destroyed by this strange flying fire girl...",0
555,"Feminist propaganda.  SJW nonsense.  Wooden lead 'actress'.  Condescending tone throughout the ad campaign.  'Star' of movie basically telling the largest demographic that would watch this stuff to go away.  Did this woman take business lessons from EA's Battlefield V School?  I won't even watch this for free on Netflix. I hate pandering, I hate preaching and I absolutely do not tolerate political agendas rammed down my throat in a movie.",0
556,"Spoilers. Change all Avengers history just to please to feminism, change Mar-Vell, not her husband, other woman replace him, a mortal can touch de Teseract energy? She must die for do it that, the Teseract has an Infinite Stone inside it. Avengers iniciative for ""Carol Avenger Danvers"", really do you need that? Do you need to change the begining of Avengers, Avengers cant start with Pym or Stark, must be a woman? All history go to trash.",0

558,"Well here's a way to climb on the shoulders of giants and claim all the glory is yours while being horribly bad yourself. I'm so disappointing in this movie, everything that it accomplished it accomplished due to previous tiles and brand name. This movie cannot stand on it's own and without prior art would have been a complete flop, probably worse than Green Lantern. Remember Marvel all your heroes ""became"" heroes due to their sacrifices and choices. Being given everything for free does not make one a hero, but a villain!",0

The second half has no stakes because the first didn't establish them. The retcons are just plain disrespectful. The avengers are named after capt marvel? Seriously? Also why have Fury lose his eye like that? In the end, this movie would be better off not existing as the damage it deals to the MCU continuity is extreme. Side note, thanks to this movie, we now have to ask where the Kree are in the other movies like Avengers 1 and Infinity War. They have a reason to be involved and they know about Earth.",0
566,"The action scenes are alright, the de-aging of early SHIELD Agents are okay. That's it. Those are the okay things about this movie. Brie Larson comes off as snobbish when she quips like Tony Stark, but became boring and unlikeable the more she does it. There are moments in the action scenes when it's all CGI that looks like it came from a PS3 game. Comedy is sub-par. Worth of nose exhale at least.To quote Laura Clifford, ""Captain Marvel is a boring mishmash of ideas from a score of other movies and franchises"".",0
567,"I was really hoping that my preconceptions were wrong - I really wanted this movie to be, at the very least, fun and enjoyable. Alas, it was neither a good film in its own right, nor was it a good addition to the MCU, which is unfortunate to say the least. The acting was bland, Larson, in my view, having been badly miscast, with many people saying that Emily Blunt could have made a better Captain Marvel. The story was the definition of a superhero blueprint. Goose and Jackson were probably my favorite things about this movie, which says a lot. Then, there is the issue of the existence of this film in the first place - if they really wanted a 'strong female lead' (with which, as a woman, I already have an issue), they should have filmed a Scarlet Witch, or even better, a Black Widow origin story... Cap Marvel is an obscure and rather disliked character (as can be seen by the number of time her runs were cancelled) who does not deserve to sweep in and save the day in Endgame. I will be deeply hurt and disappointed if this will be the case - an overpowered nobody, who was never a part of the original well-loved team, to play as a sort of 'deus ex machina' in the final movie. The marketing for the movie did not help either, but this is a review of the movie, and not the scum tactics employed by the advertisers. Hence, as much as it saddens me, I cannot in good conscience give this movie more than a 3, due to its lack of originality, bad casting, underwhelming script (seeing as the writers have done well in the indie film department prior to the making of this movie), as well as the late introduction of a new character (into the cinematic universe, that is - I am well aware of the role played by Cap M. in the comics) into a beloved series.",0
568,"wow, this was so boring, the flashbacks were horribly done. and there was no emotion shown. the eye well that was stupid. probably the worst development of a character ever.this is the sort of film you would find in the bargain bin for 2.99",0
569,"Not gonna lie. Not a fan. I hoped this would be a lot better than it was. It let me down. It was pretty mid, tbh. Fury, the Cat, the VFX and Talos ended up being the good bits. Seriously more trash than I expected and I was already let down with the direction they were going from creator/director comments but I still gave it a try.How are you gonna have your main character be so OP without real reason or sense of scaling and then have little to no actual reason for the audience to care about her? I mean, come on.Plus, what the hell was up with that girl song during the fight scene? Did something go wrong with audio mixing in post? Did you hire someone from a Netflix show to handle that bit or something? It was just jarring.Also, girl power is one thing but there's no point in making the agenda so blatant that it harms the character. Oh, I fail at things, sure, but I need a man to tell me I can't do them before I work up the motivation to do anything?Also, the cat and Fury's eye? Are you joking with me right now? Her Air Force call sign being Avenger instead of Cheeseburger? Fury not calling her for two end of the world events he had prior warning on but could pull it out seconds before the snap?Not to mention rewriting Mar-Vell as an old woman and then not even making that woman a hero? Making Monica a little girl that looks up to Carol? Are you joking right now, Marvel?What is this actual trash that you're feeding us?I paid money for this nonsense.",0
570,"This movie **** on comic book fans like me. Time and time again they use us to build something, and then use that influence to **** on us with this feminist garbage.After Talos captures Vers, in the flashback scenes, it was made clear that this is a feminist garbage propaganda. All the males in her life trying to keep her down... this is the message... to not let her even try, even though it is clear that she is failing again and again, when she is hurting herself while crashing a cart, when she is failing in the military training because her body is weak etc etc. These scenes and others are put there purposefully, not to give us the backstory of this character, but to set us up for the garbage low IQ feminist propaganda that they will push in the later parts of the movie. And the fact is, that its not the feminist message in itself, but that it is done in an unintelligent manner, very low IQ, very rude I would say. It was like those scenes were written by a teenager who can't give them depth, or complexity for that matter. It feels cold, unempathetic.Another big aspect where the feminist garbage propaganda comes out is in the multiple scenes where the character doesn't obey to the direct orders from her superiors. The thing again is not the disobeying, because Captain America does that too, frequently.... The thing is that in the Captain Marvel movie there is no backstory, no real motivation for doing that. (Capt America, on the other hand, has a very well explained reason and philosophy for going against the orders.) We should just take it for granted, that the character feels that way... and swallow it because she is empowering herself. End of discussion. Feels stupid. And the audience is left with the impression that she is just arrogant.This same aura of cockiness and arrogance follows the character during all the movie, and especially during her time with Furry.Some might argue that the actress is bad, and cant deliver the role well. Well I agree.For example the scene with the security guard after she lands on Earth, just falls flat. It is supposed to be a funny scene, but in my modest opinion, it just falls flat.But the biggest issue I have with this movie, is how they explained the ""Avengers initiative"" name. My blood boiled in that moment. I will never accept it. ****ing this way on the First Avenger is unforgivable. Captain America is an icon. Captain Marvel just a feminist tryhard garbage that is being pushed hard and fails again and again.The only thing that saves the movie is its budget ( nice effects and fight scenes) and the fact that it is set in the larger Marvel cinematic universe",0

This movie is and insult to everything they have build up until now. I can honestly say I will not be watching this one for the second time absolute waste of time.  I knew that Brie was a horrible choice for this role from day one when she was introduced at the comic con as the movie incarnation of captain marvel character. As a big MCU fan heavily invested in the franchise, I never thought I will say that I'm not looking forward to what will they come up with next. And I'm afraid that her character will spoil the upcoming ENDGAME.",0

575,"This was a boring movie with poorly written script and lack luster performance by the leading character, she didn't seem to have her heart in it, seems she just accepted the role for her personal strike at the patriarchy aka men which is disgusting!Wish this was a Black Widow or Scarlet Witch movie, both actresses are awesome and give great performances, which is why they both earned their own movies.",0

577,"Movie felt like a Marvel cash grab. I loved the supporting cast in this movie, especially Sam Jackson.  The best parts of this movie had either Sam Jackson or Goose in it.  Sadly the real reason this movie was not good was Brie Larson's acting.  Never did I once feel she was a superhero, whenever she talked or tried to act it felt very wooden.  Plus the departure from the source material I feel really hurt the over all fun in the movie.  So to sum it up: supporting cast great, Sam Jackson great, Goose great, Brie Larson acting bad, departure from source material bad.",0
578,"Similar plot to Green Lantern, but with zero character development and somehow even less interesting powers",0
579,"Strengths: Supporting Cast even if one dimensional, CGI, Short Run Time.Weaknesses: Lead character, tired out tropes, and scattered and unfocused story.This movie I tried to come in with a blank slate ignoring everything surrounding it. it goes for a phase 1 origin story coming off more as an Incredible hulk rather than Iron Man. As 80s nostalgia gives way to the 90s it does a great summary of all that makes. But like a blender mixing every ingredient it stuff in it all boils down to a bland  liquid. The supporting cast does there best with what they are given, however it's script doesn't allow any to escape their niche. As marvel is on a time table for their phase 4 there is not many opportunities for them to second guess their choices. However I do want to make a recommendation that its sister studio Lucasfilm did ""Slow Down"". Take the time to make a good product, you have been running strong for 10 years and you need to pace it now. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Also the mystique of certain characters should not be explained if you cannot come up with a satisfying answer. For awhile most thought Nick Fury lost sight in his eye due to something Robert Redford's character in Winter Soldier. Nope it had to be the cat.This is my 4th attempt to post my review. The previous attempts were on RT/Flixster.",0

I don't know the business decision was to show such a last minute shoehorn right before the big Finale was but it's not looking good. I will say if Captain Marvel takes down Thanos? I think we will have a real civil war out in the streets!First off... Nick Fury. My God... character ruined. Scratched by a cat!? That goofy acting? Almost like a completely new character. Honestly, they ruined his character here. He is a joke character basically. Secondly... Carol Danvers. What in holy hell...? Here's how it is. No memory? Ok. Acts wooden. Understandable. After memories? STILL THE SAME WOOD! Horribly miscast she acts like she doesn't want to be there, lines are delivered as if... Terminator's T-1000 seriously has more emotion delivered and that's saying something. BOR-ING and I don't mean to be harsh to the actress, but... no connection. Captain Marvel has zero personality and it's sad. First MCU movie IMO where character development is non-existent. Thirdly, this is just... weird. Skrulls. They are treated... as illegal aliens. As REFUGEES. This movie is PLAGUED with propaganda and I tried to push all of that crap OUT but it's there and it's literally shoved down your throat. And when while you're choking on it, they cram it down harder and shove MORE down your throat. It didn't feel like a movie more like a documentary or something you'd show children but use colorful characters to explain about gender, race, borders etc. it had me rolling my eyes so much I now have involuntary eye spasms. Music, as I said was great - HOWEVER... they managed to messed that up too. One particular fight scene plays I'm just a girl. So out of place, so confusing, so cringe worthy and misguided here. We get it, she's a woman. Big deal? It's amazing they green light this movie right before the big finale, and CM is supposed to be the new face of MCU? And the savior in Endgame? Oh man, I've never went from... Super excited and pumped to extremely worried in such a short time. I went from Day 1 Endgame to.. wait and see what others are saying if CM doesn't ruin it, then I'll go. Marvel let me down. I feel, not angry, but sad.It's literally depressing how things are shaping up to be, if this is an indication of the future, after Endgame I want no part of it.2/10 GOOD - Score, CG EffectsBAD  - Brie miscasted, Disrespects the MCU and its fans, Overload Propaganda messaging.",0
583,"The MCU seems to have ran into a scarcity of star-power and picked up the driest, most inflammatory racist, misandrous actress they could possibly dig up. For context: the film was released amid a flurry of bad press and bad predictions as a result of Brie Larsen's disgusting statements. Following this there's been a flurry of press to cover it up and cast negative reviews in a bad light, referring to them as ""trolls"" to justify mass removals. This is nothing short of Orwellian. Brie performed as blandly as expected and seems more fit for a role on a CW show, not a lead actress role in a Marvel hero film. It's truly a disgrace. Of all the competent talent, this slow-paced self-aggrandizing product is what Marvel churned out. This is a sad day for Marvel fans.",0
584,"Listen, Disney. I love you, man, but I think you're going down a bad road lately. We used to have such good times together, but lately I feel like you just aren't on the same page as your fans. I mean.. I didn't want to bring this up, but that whole thing with The Last Jedi really made some people doubt you. I know you said that you were going to change things up a bit after that ordeal, but this Captain Marvel thing really makes me wonder if you meant it. Please, man, for your own sake and ours, can you try going back to the Disney that created Infinity War?Sincerely, A saddened fanSeriously though, Captain Marvel was terrible. If it wasn't for Nick Fury, this movie would be a zero. I honestly worry about the fate of Endgame after seeing this retconning, poorly cast, plot hole generating, Mary Sue of a movie.",0
585,"No character development, it feels she stands for nothing, no charisma, no personality at all. I felt the plot has potential but it was made in a very mediocre way, sometimes I felt I was watching commercials, and its because the movie sacrifices action or narrative just to put an specific message (as in the last fight against yon rogg).As the movie goes on I felt everything was forced, then I realized the movie itself is forced, if this movie isn´t political propaganda then I don´t know what´s the purpose of this characters existence.",0
586,"The movie isn't very good. The character is forced. Marvel is better than this. The plot was thin, and changing mar-vel to a chick was not ideal. I Liked the tribute to Stan Lee, but was bored by the the movie.",0
587,"I really hoping the reviews where just politically motivated and I’m sure a lot are but this movie really falls short. Maybe a victim of “too much, too fast”? I should of picked the Madea flick, at least there would of been some emotion. Not a good movie.",0
588,Captain Marvel failed primarily due to a lack of kryptonite. When a character is all powerful then the story becomes immaterial.,0
589,"polticaly charged, boring and full of plot holes and events that change the overall hostory... you do not give someone all the powers just becase some random reason A ) in this case ""female"" is the reason.... captain marvel did not deserve and does not her place on the throne and, honestly, you will have a lot more importnt things to do even tho you were polaning to sleep the rest of the weekend so who gives a **** anw  also claiming that captain marvel is more powrful then Hulk and Thor etc etc is stupid.... this movie is one of the weakest MCU films ever.",0
590,"Poorly cast, dull main character, with an SJW narrative that was more developed than her role. Featured terrible editing, a forced soundtrack, and too much money was sunk into an oscar-winning starlet who could have taken the MCU role a little more seriously by playing the horrific Carol Danvers the way she was in the comics; She was an out-of-tune, raging, obstinate, control-freak who got a lot of people killed with her reckless abandon.",0
591,"I'm not going to sit here and list all the things I thought was bad, like Nick Fury's eye for example. No, I'm going to tell you worse, this movie is mediocre and not even Samuel L. Jackson or the cat could save it. Also, thank you Metacritic for not censoring reviews like Rotten Tomato.",0
592,"Sigh...Where to begin. I really held out hope for this movie going into it, despite all the political nonsense that's been surrounding it for the last couple weeks now. I've enjoyed most of the previous MCU movies and especially enjoyed infinity war, and with hopes of hints at what's to come next, I wen't to see Captain Marvel and was completely disappointed. First off, let me address the elephant in the room, the fact that this is a self proclaimed ""feminism"" movie. I wen't into the movie well aware of this, and really tried to ignore it and focus on enjoying the movie itself, but it winds up being at the core of many  of the movies issues. Carol Danvers is a completely uninteresting, uncompelling, inhuman (emotionally and somewhat literally) brick of a character and it seems clear this is from the directors attempt to focus on making her a strong, independent woman. It's as if they thought the only way to make an empowering female role model of a character was to make her emotionless, indestructible, without flaw, and obscenely powerful. Oh, and make sure to only explain her character through the hateful men in her life.Yes that's right, I'm not exaggerating that list bit at all. Despite this supposedly being an origin story, it doesn't feel like that at all. Carol's entire backstory is explained exclusively through flashbacks, nearly ALL of which are focused around how stereotypical, misogynistic men treat her like **** and tell her she's worthless and incapable of doing anything. As absurd as it all is, it doesn't even feel like a backstory in the first place. She starts the movie already indestructible and incredibly more powerful than anyone else, and then at some point towards the end of the movie, if you're still paying attention to the ridiculous flashbacks, one of the flashbacks switches from their standard hateful men moments and actually tells us something useful, that being how she got her powers. Then somehow the overpowered unstoppable force figures out how to become even more obscenely powerful? ::SPOILER::The CGI fight scenes which are visually stunning are made far less interesting knowing that literally nothing bad can happen to Carol. At one point she flies head on into a barrage of massive incoming missles meant to destroy planets, blows them up in a second, then proceeds to fly through an armada of attacking space ships, blowing them up just by crashing through them and coming out the other end completely unfazed.::END SPOILER::TL;DRUltimately, the whole thing is just an overly drawn out bore. The main character is an emotionless brick. She's so unreasonably powerful that at no point do you feel concerned for her or interested in her cause (which never really becomes clear?). Despite having 2 hours to do something, the whole story just feels forced and leaves the audience scratching there heads trying to make sense of who Captain Marvel actually is. Oh, and apparently the only way to be a powerful woman is to have a bunch of hateful men in your life? This about sums up the entire movie.",0
593,This move is by far the worst movie of the MCU.Please recast Brie Larson. She isn't good as captain marvel.,0
594,"this movie is not as good as i hoped it would be ,acting is wooden expecially brie larson , its im sorry to say overhyped!!",0
595,"Boring. Captain marvel has no charisma, overly powerful, hard to feel that I care. Besides, it's too late to introduce a new character as the Thanos arc is coming in to an end in Endgame. They should've introduce her in a new arc or sumtin e.g. Galactus? Then it would be much more interesting.",0
596,"I paid $5.75 for a matinee ticket. I want my money back. Given the trailers and Brie Larson's cringe interviews, I had decided to not see it, but as the media insanity escalated, my curiosity got the better of me. Over the years, I have written seven scripts, each better than the last. On this path in screenwriting groups, I have read way too many first scripts.  This story appears to have been written by a committee of second script screenwriters. Brie Larson's performance was wooden. I gave it a 1 because visually it had good production values, though there were obvious flaws.",0
597,"Sadly my review never got posted on RT. This movie was alright, there was no character or scene rememberable. This movie failed to give a real characterization of women, Maria looked butch and what mother will leave her young daughter to go on a dangerous and pointless space adventure. Women can be more vindictive than men, I am sure the writers of this movie have some knowledge of shows like The bad girls club and Real Housewives. It looked like Carol and Maria was more than just friends as well. The male bashing was obvious, the theme control your emotions was reoccurring but Captain Marvel had none to start with. But still it was worth watching this movie to see how it fit into Endgame.",0
598,"don’t even know where to begin with this movie and how dissapointed and bitter I was when I walked out. Came here because Rotten Tomatoes deleted my honest review: Captain Marvel has serious pacing and script problems, and Carol Danvers is an evident miscast - Brie Larson is not fit for the role at all - she may be good in other movies, but in this one is as it she never won an Oscar. Her acting is dull, stall, automatic and deprived of personality, which compared to the acting of the rest of the cast falls behind in a massive manner (the contrast is just too notable between acting skills). The movie has no character development and barely any character growth(she never really had a true hit rock bottom moment in which she stands again gaining strength from a mistake)....Carol Danvers is the same as when she started at the end. and barely has a plot which makes this a really slow film. I don’t know how the directors got the idea that we would like an emotionless invinsible and flawless woman deprived from humanity from the start to end to represent woman’s feelings. The story has barely humor, two of the famous jokes of the movie barely made a chuckle in the audience. The only good things about this movie, the rest of the cast including Samuel Jackson, Jude Law, Talos actor and Maria Ranbou kid performances are good.In my country people always clap at the end of an MCU movie. This did not happen this time as people left with a sour and bitter taste.3/10 aside from the pacing and script problems, MCU needs to recast Captain Marvel to someone who can act in a superhero movie in a way that people can relate and feel that in fact she is a hero. She is not a bad actress but her performance in this movie is a low blow to her acting history and career.",0
599,"This film needs to be even more free. Because he has potential, as seen in the middle and near the end. The story is actually also not very flat, there are some agendas that are trying to be tucked away, because that's how normal today's superhero films are; there is always an agenda insert that comments on our social circumstances and the like. This film can still entertain the audience; both ordinary viewers, children's audiences, and nerdy viewers like me. Rarely are there super hero stories whose main characters are girls, right? It's just that inner beauty is not digested enough, because the filmmaker did not dare to make his own voice. Just like they were assigned to make a film to introduce who Captain Marvel was to the last episode of Avengers, and they did it. Only that. And we can move on as soon as possible to wait for the next movie airing date.",0
600,"So I had told myself that wasn't going to go see Captain Marvel because of all of this bullcrap going on with it. Yet Marvel had never let me down across the last 10 years and so I went to go watch Captain Marvel with a cautiously optimistic mind ... twice. I watched it the first time on a regular screen and the second time in 3D. If you are still thinking about going out to watch it, don't bother with 3D. It seemed like it was added as an afterthought and doesn't add any value to the movie.So all I can say is that Brie Larson is a thoroughly average actress in every regard. She's been working in Hollywood long enough that either she has ""it"" or she doesn't; Brie Larson doesn't. She simply cannot seem to muster the ""it-factor"" to be a leading actress. Her performances are completely forgettable; including this one. I've watched Kong: Skull Island multiple times as it's a good movie to kill time on a long flight; I keep forgetting that she even played in that movie. She will never bring the kind of dynamic interactions that a Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie brought in Mr & Mrs Smith or Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in Wedding Crashers. This kind of dynamic interaction is what makes lead actors and actresses dominate every scene that they are in. Yet even with perhaps one of the funniest and most adaptable/improvisational leading actors in Hollywood right now (Samuel L Jackson) she couldn't make it work. I mean the best and most memorable scenes were with SLJ and the damn cat. Which is sadly and ironically hilarious. I think that casting someone like Katee Sackhoff would have made for a much better film because Brie Larson was a poor choice.This brings me to the movie itself. The movie was a basic if sluggishly straightforward ""super-hero"" film. The twists and turns were sadly predictable. Each scene seemed as if it took just a tad longer to get to the point and reason why it's in the movie. Almost as if there wasn't enough ""story"" to make a full-length movie and each scene stretched itself out to help fill the time requirements. The script seemed like it was written by a bunch of 5th graders; on second thought I've watched ""Are you smarter than a 5th grader"" and the kids on that show probably would have come up with something better. The jokes and puns are fairly lame and you could tell that Samuel L Jackson was doing his absolute best with the crap that he got. I think that the only good thing that this film has going for it was the CGI space scenes and how they de-aged SLJ. Though a couple brief moments they let slip the effect and SLJ was his current age - but was very difficult to catch & very brief; I missed it the first time I saw it. Perhaps it happened when they added the 3d effects and it messed with the de-aging. I don't do CGI so I wouldn't know; that's purely a guess.There is absolutely nothing that is critical information to know that ties Captain Marvel into Avengers Endgame so this movie can be completely skipped and you won't have missed much. Besides the main tie-in is Fury's pager going dark at Avengers HQ scene and the cat coughing up the Tesseract on Nick Fury's desk scene and both of those are all over YouTube anyway. I'd give the film 3/10 and that's mainly for the CGI effects (and knowing that SLJ seems to be great with cats).﻿",0
601,"I tried to post my review on RT, but hey, guess what … they don't let me do it. So why wasting any time there – let be a ""Metacritic"" instead. Here we go:While this is the MCU's attend to get their own Wonderwoman, they fail very badly: WW was packed with emphasis, emotions and this special human touch you need to introduce such a character. CM is just blurry, loud, pale and just blank. There is nothing: no emtions, no sympatetic moments, no accesability. This is pure propaganda for justifying a representation of women in film – but why? We all LOVE ""Kill Bill"", ""Alien"", ""Matrix"", ""Resident Evil"", ""Mad Max"" or ""Underworld"" – did we ever needed to be remided of their protagonists who kicked axx (despite or because) they were female? This is a bad move. A bad movie. And pleas don't let me start to review the performance (or the lack of) of Brie Larson. No comment.",0
602,"Trash,Horrible,Unsuportable,but i had one friend abdala and he likes so much this film",0
603,"It's a bad movie, it's a mess with some pretty unforgivable plot holes, the treatment of Nick Fury reduced to an emasculated joke is just infuriating (pun intended), the gender swapping of Mar-Vell as a self serving agenda is laughable, the hand to hand action is terrible and you can see the size of the stunt double all the time, but the worst of all is the main character, she never grows, she never struggles, she never suffers, there is no hero's journey,just a slow boring descent into the Realm of the Mary Sue. She puts in danger the whole MCU",0
604,"This **** was just bad. I don't know if it's worse than Iron Man 2, 3 or Black Panther (Yes. BP sucked too) but it is definitely in the running for worst Marvel movie for sure.",0
605,"Please Disney.  Please do not ruin the MCU with these poor quality films.  Get better directors, better writers, better actors/actresses.  This cookie cutter of a movie with it's daytime tv acting and production value WILL kill the MCU!!!",0
606,"The one bit of excitment in this whole fillm was when Rambo was dog fighting, all the rest of the movie was just bland. Captain Marvel was just too overpowered and boring. Nothing ever threatened her all the other action scenes are just dull.",0
607,"Watched it today. Boring and annoying. Wrong actress with bad acting skills and honestly she is 3/10 (she is ugly).I want pretty, good looking super hero women in movies, i pay money for it. Im waiting WonderWoman-2",0
608,This is supposed to be the most powerful hero in the Marvel Universe and yet we are left with an emotionless boring waste of time by the end. It could have been so so much better especially with that killer opening but Marvel got this one incredibly wrong.,0
609,"Very bad movie, don´t go to cinema, boring is a piece of **** Is a stranger telling you that is gonna save the day.",0
610,"Very disappointing considering all the Marvel movies that have come before. It feels like a long episode made for a TV show, and apart from the last fight scene looks very cheap throughout. The dialogue and delivery is dull and flat, and the pacing is off. Brie Larson was miscast as she brings nothing to the character and was very wooden and un-likeable. The character of Captain Marvel has no complexity or depth, she has no flaws, no weaknesses and is supposedly stronger than anyone else in the MCU, so doesn't have any character progression or anything to overcome, making her bland an nothing about her relate-able that you can get behind or route for, and frankly one dimensional and boring. Did Marvel suddenly forget all the things that makes a character great, and interesting? Overall a very boring and uninteresting film that seems rushed and shoe horned into the MCU, and the first uninteresting and pointless character added to the roster. Sam Jackson was great, but even he couldn't save this movie. Totally unnecessary film, I'd skip this one as its just not worth it.",0
611,"Slow,boring,Brie Larson has an even shallower array of emotion than Kristen Stewart.  All in all a complete let down and an unsurprising signal of the poor future of Marvel films.",0
612,"The movie has bad pacing, bad acting (from the lead) if they removed Brie Larson from the film an maybe gotten Yvonne Strahovski who could show emotions an not be so stiff and ridged. Then maybe this movie would have been better.  Removing everything from the press tour this movie fails to deliver what it was suppose to. A action packed hero. It doesn't help that Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers) has no real origin story to set up a awesome hero.  She just gets power without doing any real character development at all. She is the same person before powers as she is with them. It doesn't show she is really willing to do anything for anyone. She is a clear definition of a Mary Sue. If she is going to lead the MCU in the future they might as well just stop making movies an take a few years off to work on some animated movies or work on the comics that are failing to show a profit, like Captain Marvels failed launches.Over all the few things this movie does right is overshadowed by everything it tried an failed to show in the movie and also what led up to it. I would like to rate it higher as I might deserve a higher score for trying I think it needs to be said that this is not a movie that should have been made before End Game. It would have been better to give Captain Marvel a better start in the MCU than as this all powerful brat.",0
613,"This movie defeats the whole purpose of creating a fictional superhero universe. Because according to the main actress and marvel, it's no longer about uniting people through movies. It's about dividing people and bringing forth ugly agendas. This is not art. It's propaganda.",0
614,"I snuck into the movie even though I was told this movie was not for me.  She was right. Stay away.  The only reason I went is for the Endgame connection, they got me.  Worse than Thor: The Dark World.  This movie strays from comic book arc way too much, the only thing close was how she got her powers. Brie was horrid. Script looked rushed.  Too many plotholes with the MCU cannon. You could tell this film was forced into the MCU timeline.  I really hope that it doesn't carry over to Endgame.But, hey you can finally know how Fury lost his eye.",0
615,"A wasted opportunity on what is ultimately an inconsequential movie for a forgettable shoe-horned character.Tragically overshadowed by a CGI cat, out shined by Jackson and Mendelsohn and woefully out classed by other cast mates in the end credit scene Larson fails to impress.Worse yet were the special effects, far below the usual MCU standards they would have been better suited to a TV series instead of the Silver Screen.Still worse were the highly predictable plot points and dialogue... though I was surprised (and disappointed) of their torpedoing of future Skrull story lines... all in all a disappointment despite a few smirk inducing jokes that were probably improvised by Jackson.  And Nick Fury's eye... are you kidding me!!?!",0
616,not a great movie if it was not for the cats performance it would have been a 0 from me,0
617,"Captain Marvel starts off ok, but essentially devolves to insult MCU fans.The good:- opening origin act- CM smiling at a de-aged Stan LeeThe bad (a sampling):- retcon/emasculation of Lee Pace, ruining Guardians of the Galaxy- retcon of the tesseract into a coughed up hairball (sorry Cap/Howard Stark)- the true origin of ""Avenger""- international badass Nick Fury loses his eye to...a $@%& cat scratch- glactic illegal aliens (sigh)- Brie Larson...Oscars are apparently handed out to anyone with an active SAG membershipIf your new/don't care about the past decade of MCU lore and like some not so subtle political messaging in your popcorn flicks, you might enjoy CM. If you would rather see a string character that happens to ne a woman, stream Wonder Woman or go see Alita instead.",0
618,"Terrible script filled with continuity mistakes and poorly developed character arcs.Larson's delivery was wooden and uninspired. Lackluster CGI.  Forgettable music. Fight scenes were flat;  cuts were often random and incoherent.  Sam Jackson was strong as usual, but overall, this was the worst MCU film to date. I had heard that all the bits with the cat were hilarious, but I didn't end up laughing once.",0
619,"Carol Danvers started off as a strong soldier and simply became incrementally stronger as the film continued without any perceivable obstacles. Given Captain Marvel's effortless journey, it was essential that her character be well developed. On that front, Brie Larson failed. She was an expressionless husk of a character who was unlikable throughout the film. She wasn't funny, interesting, or flawed. Total miscast.",0
620,"Fell asleep mid-movie... okay, I was probably tired but there also was nothing to keep me awake. The trailers are an accurate depiction of the whole project: bland, uninspired, bad casting, bad acting, childish humour and forced  politics down your throat. The whole thing is getting tiresome. 2 for the special effects, sound and costumes. Zero for everything else.",0
622,"Boring. So boring.Went to see it because it somehow ties in with Endgame, but I don't believe Marvel would truly want such a boring movie to be associated with it.Sam Jackson is the only good thing in this terrible film. Poor guy.",0
623,"If you have at least half a brain, you could see this movie has been filled with a particular agenda...  From the Kree to the Refugees all the way to where Danvers removes her limiter....  This movie was slightly entertaining due to the other cast members but was just a bore when it came to the main character. I can't tell if that's how she was supposed to be in the movie or if that is what the actor wanted to portray in the movie.  The fact that Capt. Marvel hardly has any alone screen time by herself shows that she needed assistance from all the other characters to make the story somewhat plausible and believable.  This movie is without a shadow of a doubt, one of the worst MCU movies to date along with being right up there with The Last Jedi; and we all seen how that movie turned out!....",0
624,"Would you like a hero who has zero emotions? This is for you. Brie delivers this ""mindless"" hero perfectly. I suppose this is to act strong but comes across as boring and like a B rated actor is trying to keep up with Sam. Want to have a fight? Shouldn't the audience be engrossed in what's happening? Just who cares moments for the most part. Good CGI I guess but did not care if she won the fight. It seemed like no one even tested her and she was too unexcited to care. The only redeeming thing this film has is Colson or the Cat. This whole movie reminded me of when the CW has a crossover series and they spend a little more on CGI. Plot? predictable do the right thing against the people that you thought were your friends. I would recommend waiting for the video. The two additional scenes can be googled and let me tell you. Nothing Special. Also, RIP Stan Lee.",0
625,I'm just a girl by No Doubt in a fighting scene was just cringy. The political agenda was so prevalent. It was more about politics then the actual movie.,0
626,"The positive: Some comedy moments, Goose, Fury, Jude Law, and the fight scenes.The Negative:Plot holes in continuity, Soundtrack selection on the end fight scene, the soundtrack selection in the end scene having come out 3 years after her abduction by the Kree (she was not on earth for 6 years) Flashback scenes showing bad memories being shoe-horned in as a slightly overt feminist messaging that the patriarchy is suppressing women.The motorcyclist saying ""you should smile more"" ""freak"" is shown as the ""men are pigs"" trope of victimhood feminism.  Sure there are bad people in the world, but come on.  The scenes were jumpy and confusing, bordering on motion-sickness inducingBrie Larson did have some good emotional expression, but it came as a point of defiance, and a cost of character relatability, further pushing the dehumanizing aspect of modern feminism.  The ""you're not good enough"" lines by all the men in her life come off as another dose of the victimhood identitarianism that modern feminism is trying to push.  Women nowadays have More opportunities than men, contrary to this position.  A recent Google audit of average wages actually shows a small gap in women's favor.This whole movie was shoehorned into the MCU, and if they continue this trope, Phase 4 will go down in flames.The explanation that Fury's eye damage was caused by a Flurkin scratch felt like it cheapened Fury's reason for an eye patch.The worst part about this movie is that Captain Marvel was an unpopular comic when it came out, and was Ret-Con Mary-Sued into existence.  The Kree/Scrull flip was even contrary to the narrative in the actual comic. The Kree have ALWAYS been the enemy.",0
627,"I wanted a ""90's movie,"" but this is really just set in the 90's.  It reminded me of Thor: The Dark World.  Just kind of ""eh,"" with a similar plot.  After 21 Marvel films, I'm sure most people who have seen them all will rank this one toward the bottom.  Most.  It was nothing worth getting worked up over for fans or the press.  Brie Larson, as others have pointed out, was unemotive and bland.  There are some special effects I found on par with the first ""X-Men"" movie.  I found the amount of direct references and nostalgia overwhelming sometimes.  It ironically took me out of the movie knowing Brie Larson was born in 1989, the year NIN released ""Pretty Hate Machine.""  Does Brie Larson know that?  I doubt it.  It just doesn't ""feel"" like 199X.  Bad reviews are not meant to hurt the feelings of those involved in the production.  No one is trying to hurt Brie Larson or her career by saying they don't like or want to see this movie.  It's just an opinion, not ""trolling.""",0
628,"All Captain Marvel reveals:1. Alien threat assessment tech will read a human male as “threat level: low to NONE”.2.

Don’t call a woman “young lady”, even if she’s middle aged and it might seem like a compliment, because it’s offensive and she will shove it where the sun don’t shine, because it's 2019, and verbal sexism is on par with physical violence.4.

That's all you need to know going into Engame: she can fly, she can teleport, or if not teleport she can travel through time (otherwise she would break Einsteins law of relativity flying back from deep-space), and she can also act as an antenna booster because she received the pager in deep-space. (I should explain this a bit, a pager sends a message, but you need another pager to receive on the other end. Carol gave Fury's pager back to him, the one we saw in Inifinity War, and left Earth without a corresponding pager. So yeah, she basically became a super antenna and can intercept all forms of digital transmissions... I guess? Like seriously, feminist writing...lol).",0
629,Pacing problems. The movie took forever to get going and felt like a filler episode.,0
630,"I had my doubts about this movie for more three months now but I went it do to my girlfriend's request. We went boy was I right to have my doubts! First off the movie starts okay but than quickly goes into this wacky pacing that still is making head spin. Furthermore the movie added elements that would pay off the worst way, the cat, and don't get me started what this moive did the skrull. Save your money and go watch Alita instead.",0
631,"A mess, and not even a fun one. It's confusing, stupid, dull and boring. And pretty bad CGI too. Probably the worst Marvel movie yet, and might even be worse than the DC movies, and that's saying a lot.",0
632,"A disasterBoring uninspired movie, with bad characters, awful fights that almost can not be seen because everything is filmed awfully and with a disastrous soundtrack.In other words, it was exactly what I expected. It also has the worst Marvel post-credit scene.Carol Danvers is a joke and the worst hero of the Marvel universe. Irritating character, with almost no personality, acted badly and without development at all.Oh, and his powers are ""whatever"". Seriously, there are no rules or anything, she can do anything because yes.""But samuel L jackson is good""Sure, for about 20 minutes but then it becomes completely useless and they only have him to make cat jokes. That cat is the only good character btw.",0
633,"I went in with a fresh mind...I tried to avoid the negativity surrounding the movie, and I'm a big MCU fan...but sadly it was so boring for me...such a chore... I liked a few things like Samuel and the Cat...it wasn't so controversial...and it had ok CGI...but the acting of Larson was so flat and forced...the friendship was so forced....I don't know guys...never gave an MCU movie this low Rating...but I will rated like this because it is my strong opinion after seeing it.",0
634,"This movie is so boring, I almost fell asleep in the cinema. And now I know why the critics hated Alita... because this boring **** come out after that, and Alita is much better than this... Alita with all the cgi face has more emotion in 1 min then Captain Marvel in the entire movie. So let's make a fast comparison between the two:Critics said Alita has bad cgi, well Capitain Marvel cgi is 5times worse at least.Critics said Alita script was weak, well Captain Marvel script is worse.Critics said Alita story is **** Capitain Marvel story is broke...Critics had problems with acting in Alita, Captain Marvel acting is just horrible, no emotions whatsoever.So yeah, now I know why Alita got those reviews... because Disney wanted the exclusive right for the best female hero. But Marvel is the worst hero I ever saw so far. Wonder Women and Alita is the best female hero and Marvel can't even compare. I wanted to give it a 4-5 out of this, but after what they did with the damage control, I can't give this more than a 1.",0
635,"Putting aside my personal feelings for Larson as a person, and all the SJW push (whether for or against) I still must say her performance in this was about as poor as could be.  She was not the right person to play this role.  Even if all else remained equal, that Captain Marvel was still a SJW push, that she was ridiculously overpowered, etc...her acting ability is awful and her voice grating.  There were so many other actresses to choose from, and they pick an unmotivated, wooden Kristen Stewart-ish caliber actress like her?  The only one that may have been a worse choice would have been Jennifer Lawrence.  Yvonne Strahovski or Katheryn Winnick would have been far superior choices!  Nonetheless, the story itself was sub-par.  Samuel L. Jackson was a highlight, and I'm not overly fond of him, but he certainly feels like Nick Fury.  The real star is the cat.  Ever try to train a cat?  Yes, the cat is the star.",0
636,"After all the controversy Brie Larson have caused, the Captain Marvel isn't a bad character to make a movie. Casting to this movie doesn't do honors to great and powerful characters the Real Captain Marvel is in the comic books. Brie Larson leaves unemotional and forced feeling of a superhero which feels more like a caricature than the badass Captain Marvel is. Director should have been taken notes from Wonder Woman movie more and not from the Ghostbuster 2016 when marketing this movie. And remember, you can't spell hero without HER, but HE comes always first.",0
637,"After Rotten Tomatoes has completely sold out to Disney, censoring free speech while spamming endless bot accounts, I will take my business here. Captain Marvel is the worst movie to ever be made. It’s actress is beyond unlikeable. Saying numerous remarks about her hatred for white men. If anyone said a similar remark of hating black people, there would be a massive uproar but it’s ok when it’s agaisnt white people. Except no it’s not ok. The movie itself is just racist sexist propaganda. Everything including saying how men are telling Brie to smile more. Nobody cares about angry lonely miserable feminists. They aren’t going to tell them to smile. They are going to avoid them. Also how you made Nick Fury loss his eye does not make any sense with the canon of this entire franchise. Furthermore it’s a slap in the face and a huge insult to the fans. Even the fellow Marvel cast who have been very vocal about their dislike of Trump, are against Brie Larson. You’ve really messed up when you’ve gone too far even for them. The fighting is bad. The story garbage. There’s no real villain. Oh yeah and she’s the biggest Mary Sue in the universe that’s essentially perfect at everything",0
638,This movie is not worth the popcorns you bring. Brie Larson is a wooden Mary Sue and the plot is crap. You know its crap when the cat steals the attention.,0
639,"This movie was not all that bad in isolation, mediocre at bast. But there were a lot of annoying political messages. The characters were bland and had no life to them.What really killed this movie is that it created so many plot holes in the MCU as a whole. I find that this change is disrespectful to the original material and ruins the greater story.",0
640,"A boring and generic MCU film. The story is generic, the plot is pretty predictable, and the comedy falls flat and here are the reasons. Brie Larson tries to copy Tony Stark, Peter Quill and Dr. Strange to make quips. While they are supported by excellent timing and proper hilarious facial expressions, Larson delivers it with this sort of monotone voice and “bored” facial expression, and that’s why it didn’t connect to us. The CGI in this movie is pretty standard for a Marvel movie, but sometimes it goes berserk. The action scenes on the ground are pretty ok, but the battles in outer space looks like a cutscene from a PS3 game.Ben Mendelsohn and Samuel L. Jackson both gave stellar performances. Seeing Jackson’s cheerful attitude before being a tough and rough character seen in Iron Man and beyond is hard at first, but gradually accepted. Goose the alien cat absolutely steals the show and the limelight from Captain Marvel herself (How does that happen though… it’s a damn cat?).The social justice theme dampen the movie’s story. It’s as if the story is built around the premise of “she’s a woman”, as in, the focus is the gender, not the story and character building itself, and that’s really disappointing, since if only the focus is on character building with social justice being inserted subtly it would work well and bring forth the message to empower women of all ages and races.All in all, you do not see this movie for its connection with the upcoming Avengers: Endgame, but if you still want to see it be my guess. I do not recommend it, though.",0
641,"a mediocre hero origin story. There's no surprise plot twist. After about 5 mins in the movie, audience can pretty much predict how the movie will end.",0
642,"This is the weakest Marvel movie so far. It lack in all departments, story is trivial, characters are unlikable, acting is blend. I am really worried for the incoming Avengers Endgame movie, after watching this movie.",0
643,"Laughable performance by wooden leads and a story full of Mary Sue moments that just felt completely out of character for Marvel. Atrocious movie, if you ~must~ see it because of Muh Infinity Wur, at least wait for the dvd.",0
644,"Should have got a better reception if not for all that unnecessary political correctness, sjw and all that has nothing to do with creating a great movie. Looks like direction got distracted from delivering a good story, hence is a boring movie and not up to par with marvel standards. Nothing to do in the Marvel universe when character feels forced.",0
645,This movie was riddled with retcons and a bunch of nauseating jokes the writing was terrible and poor musical score. This is the point where i jump off from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. this movie is has bad structure. just about every character is fantastic except Captain marvel (Carol Danvers) everyone else can stand on their own. but the writing for Carol is just god awful. so many changes to the story such as Mar-Vell being a guy originally being gender swapped to a woman. people talk about White washing. but when it happens to a white or a male no one bats an eye at it. Captain marvel has such great music just misplaced. like Nirvana's Come as you are. perfect place for that should have been when Carol removed that chip that was holding her back. not before that scene. the i'm just a girl song was terrible placement. i get why they used it. but that fight scene should have used like i said Come as you are from Nirvana or something different. the song just doesn't fit that fight scene. the Cat's performance in the movie is terribly blown out of proportion. How fury comes up with the Avengers initiative is dumb as writing. how he loses his eye is dumb writing. the best part of the movie is the stan lee tribute.the absolute most damning part of the movie is i was yawning through the movie. i've never yawned through any marvel movie to date. this movie was totally flat tone death and disappointing by MCU standards. I used to think Ironman 3 was terrible. this is a new level of terrible.,0
646,Completely no character development whatsoever. The preview critics was actually correct goose the cat was the only good part of the movie. I loved CGI on Fury's face. Disappointed,0
647,"Terrible, terrible, just so terrible, that is merely terrible, so damn terrible as terrible as it can only be",0
648,I love the MCU and I generally do enjoy most of the movies. They usually have some message to them and are fun but this one is just stale and boring. It is purely lacking any content.,0
649,"Definitely one of the weakest entries into the Marvel universe. I would rank it somewhere near Thor 1, but that movie at least had Thor, who is a good character in it. My biggest fear after seeing it is that this could really damage the outcome of Endgame.If not for the supporting actors in this movie, it would have been a total loss. Samuel L. Jackson is great, as usual and Ben Mendelsohn has some good moments. Brie Larson just comes across as flat and irritating in most scenes (And no, I'm not saying that because of all the political stuff). All of the other Marvel characters have their ""thing""; Captain America is selfless and honorable, Thor is kind of conceited and funny because of that & Tony Stark is sarcastic and smart. Captain Marvel is just Brie Larson playing herself in a Captain Marvel suit.As for the plot, I found it disjointed and mostly boring for the first 75%, but it did manage to pull itself together towards the end and wasn't completely dissatisfying. That said, there are numerous wrenches being thrown into the ""lore"" that has already been established in previous movies and in the comic book stories that made me like it less and less the more I think about it. I.E., the original Captain Marvel was a man named ""Walter Lawson"", now that character is gender-swapped into ""Wendy Lawson"", who never had any sort of power in this timeline. It's just an odd choice. You also have the Tesseract somehow getting into Lawson's hands even though we know that Tony Stark's father had it last. I'm not the type of person who minds a small amount of pandering occasionally, but this movie did cross the line multiple times. There are many scenes from Captain Marvel's life that all revolve around men telling her she can't do something. In the specific scenarios that they show, that just wouldn't happen unless she was somehow surrounded by absolute monsters her whole life. It's just silly. Not to mention the final fight scene blaring ""Just a girl"" the entire time. It's just too heavy-handed. No group of soldiers would watch a female trainee fall 15-30 feet off a rope course and land on her back, then just laugh at her for no other reason than ""She's a girl"". That's not reality.I also very much dislike that Captain Marvel's power is so over the top. She destroys a Kree battleship just by running into it. Fighter ships bounce off of her without her even intending to destroy them. It has the potential to absolutely ruin the next Infinity War movie. I understand that she is very powerful, but this is just too much. The CGI in this movie was also very bad in several scenes.Overall, I would give this maybe a 2 or 3 out of 10. Avoid until it hits Netflix if possible.",0
650,"The film was okay but i found it very boring, Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury was funny at times and he in a way made the film watchable,but after a kind of interesting start the film started to drag with lifeless acting from Brie Larson who was not believable as a superhero and felt like she was just reading her lines and looked liked she didn't even want to be filming her scenes.Special effects were okay but at the end of the day this film was no Wonder Woman or Alita Battle Angel..Hope the next Avengers film next month is better made than this one.",0
651,"Useless movie, no charisma whatsoever from Larson. They should've skipped this movie and simply plug her in in Endgame like they did with Black Panther in Civil War. Hoping they recast CM, even though I'm not a fan of that character, she does deserve better. I am peeved that they gender swapped Mar-Vel, that absolutely unnecessary and petty. Definitely not recommending this movie, save yourselves the time and money.",0
652,What a letdown. I don't care what Brie said I do care when it becomes a blueprint for a propaganda piece. All the Marvel movies had politics in them but this is forced and fake. The lead has no arc and her real superpower is inducing boredom in movie audiences. They even emasculated Samuel L. Jackson. Movies like this hurt the left and give the right strength.,0
653,"Besides the political agenda it champions, it's just not good. The skrulls good? Nick Fury losing his eye to a cat? Brie Larson's lackluster performance it all adds up to a below average movie. As a fan of Marvel in general and as a person who has enjoyed Infinity War greatly, I do not understand how in the span of a year you go from a spectacle as great as A:IW to this. I seriously hope the rumors that Brie Larson will be the new face of Marvel are not true and that her swooping in to save the day in Endgame is an exaggeration.",0
654,The overpowered Captain Marvel now has the prestige of competing for the worst MCU film of all time against Iron Man 2 and Thor the dark world.,0
655,"Great effects and thats it. The story is mediocre, the main hero played by wooden actress has no arc or personality whatsoever.",0
656,"the story is a blur, the redeeming quality is only the visual...not worth your time",0
657,"boring, there was no fun involved, except for some rare moments ...........",0
658,"Brie Larson trying to be funny in the movie. How she got her powers was bullsh1t. When she had where crying moment scene with her friend, it didn't feel emotional, it felt fake.The cat Goose was all the talk but it didn't do much. Boring storing and action sequence was boring.",0
659,"It started off well enough but very quickly devolved in to a boring and convoluted script which both ruined this movie and the MCU continuity. Much of the acting felt forced and it almost seemed like they didn't want to be there, especially the actors portraying the overthetop misogynists; and those scenes were forced in for sure. Captain Marvel is the Marvel Comics leader in virtue signaling and all round SJW terrorist. Taking this character in her current incarnation to the big screen spells nothing but trouble as seen by the movie itself. Thank Stan that they didn't get as bad as the comics.The pacing is pretty bad too. I sat there kinda scratching my head as to why many choices were made in where to go next. On top of that, the action sequences were very meh. We could chalk that up to Carol Manvers being made to be ""The strongest character ever"" in the MCU. Pretty sure regardless, Thanos could slap her around easily, and I'd pay to see that at this point. The Skrull/Kree war was a big deal in the comics, too bad it wasn't on the big screen. Yet another agenda being forced on the consumer.Here's the deal, I want a fun movie. I want to be entertained when I go to the theater. I am fine with some things being changed from the comics to make the movie more digestible for the ""normies"". This is why I love all the other MCU movies. But this movie is just lazy and has no spark. I am scared for Avengers: Endgame now and might just tap out of the MCU altogether if they are really pushing for Captain Marvel to head the next 10 years.",0
660,"OMG this movie was horrible.  The acting by Brie Larson was bland and stiff.  The special effects came under one of two categories:  ok, but not great, or downright awful.  It's like two different companies were assigned to handle the CGI.  The amount of in your face feminism, and anti-Trump slights was ever present and unnecessary. And the revelation on how Nick Fury lost his eye was lore-busting.  I'm not sure why this movie was made other than to push a frivolous agenda.  If this is how it will be in Endgame I'll probably end up skipping it.",0
661,Very Boring Movie and very bad film when compared to the gems that the other Marvel movies have been.  I found myself dosing off during the second half.  Brie Larson is boring and uninteresting as Carol Danvers.  This film is very heavy handed with its political agenda and also relies heavily on the wave of 90s nostalgia that is taking place at the moment. 1 out of 10 would not see again!,0
662,Brie Larson's Charactor as Captain Marvel was plain. Story started out as good but was really bad through most of the movie. The relationship with Maria Rambeau wasnt there to believe at all. Samuel L Jackson was great and the cat was cute. This movie is not worth seeing,0
663,"Wish i didn't spend my money watching this at the theater. It's really bland, and the only thing that makes this movie watchable is the 'cat'",0
665,Terrible. Action was terrible and the main actress had some of the worst acting I've seen in a while. Only thing keeping me from giving it a 0 was S. Jackson,0
666,"This movie is boring.  1st act was ok but went downhill after that.  Brie Larson terribly miscast.  Her fighting abilities were god awful and the jerky jump cuts didn’t cover it at all.  Sam Jackson was good but the de-aging FX was disconcerting since it was for the whole movie.  How he lost his eye was absolutely ridiculous.  Ronin was completely wasted.  The skrulls as the good guys/knock on immigration policy...come on.  Some feminazi shots taken.  Her being the reason for the Avengers name, Disrespectful.   cap marvel just rushed and shoehorned in to this universe that has been great for 10+ yrs.  I really hope this doesn’t stain endgame.  Rotten tomatoes has completely lost any credibility because of this movie.  Worst marvel movie to date.  Hopefully this was a one off, if this is a sign of things to come for the MCU then I’m done with it.",0
667,"Boring, I expected so much more from MCU when compared to all the MCU movies I've seen i.e. all off them. a super here must have at least 1 weakness where Captain Marvel has none. Superman = Kryptonite, Batman = mortality, Flash = cold, Iron Man = alcohol + PTSD",0
668,i was really willing to give this movie a chance. The plot was boring. Corny jokes and poor acting really made this movie cringey. I just hope this doesnt ruin avengers endgame.,0
669,"The Movie would be mediocre if it was a stand alone movie in some distant universe. no its in the damn MCU. ActingBrie larsons acting is very very poor. her face expressions are bland and no energy her voice is the same. samule Jackson has some good lines and even though the cgi was pretty bad.PlotThe plot is freaking awful it makes 0 sense she is a complete marry sue through out the entire thing she has no character arc and while some of the messages it sends are ok they are out of place. she is the same person in the beginning as in the end.

They pretend they have never seen a hero Captain america, She destroys an accusers ship even though a nova core ravengers and guardian s couldn't stop them. made ronan retreat even though he can changeling thanos, fury looses an eye to a cat??? skrulls are good guys ??? Kree are bad ???????????? the movie is bad dont see it don watch it dont spend your money",0
670,Boring and uninteresting.  If you like the previous 10 years of marvel this is not the movie for you.  It feels very agenda driven rather than focusing on the characters and story they would rather push the narrative.  You never really feel like Capt Marvel has a personality (or at least one that is interesting or fun).  She is seriously suffering from superman syndrome.,0
671,"Its Captain Meh-Vel. I want to say I went to this movie, with an open mind. But i could not believe this is a MCU Movie. To Start I like the 90's setting, Sam L Jackson as Nick fury, Ben Mendelsohn as Talos the skrull and Goose the Cat. I found this movie boring on all fronts.. The Script is bad. Jokes fall flat. Brie Larson is stone cold. It feels like a bad 90's superhero movie. I would call this the Worst MCU Movie. This Movie can hurt the MCU, It made Captain Marvel so powerful that everyone before is useless. I hope that there is some type of damage control to Save it. But here hoping. It has also left a  bad taste, which could affect Endgame. I would not suggest going to this movie, wait till it comes out on a streaming service",0
672,"The most disappointing thing about CAPTAIN MARVEL is that there's no character growth. Captain Marvel goes from confident badass to even more powerful confident badass. The problems stem from a script that's a structural mess, but even the effects and make-up look underdeveloped. Captain Marvel looks fake zooming around in space and the Skrulls look straight out of a show like ""The Orville"" - not a $152 million movie. Captain Marvel deserved better and so did the cast. Brie Larson is a great actress, but she's got nothing to work with here. Under better direction this could've been a worthy film of its empowering message.",0
673,"Did not live up to the hype. Almost fell asleep due to boredom and horrible acting from Brie Larson. The end fight scene was pretty good , but not enough to save this film.",0
674,"You know what's more insulting than an actress and actor insulting their primary viewing audience? A film that doesn't respect that audience's intelligence, with a wildly incoherent narrative spun via a bland script, uninspired and overly edited action scenes, a wildly incoherent and poorly portrayed protagonist whose plank-like expression inspires no pathos whatsoever, and a jumble of mixed lore that not only clashes with what we already know of the MCU and reeks of retconning, with a sort of ""oops, we forgot to introduce this character earlier, but they're super important and great at everything and somehow missing during the last 20-odd movies, so here they are, I guess?!"" vibe to the whole charade. Mendelsohn and Law are the only ones who get out of this scot-free. There's something approaching the uncanny valley with how Samuel L. Jackson has been de-aged. I'm not exactly jazzed thinking about how much of the film's budget went into that effect, when they could have spent it actually trying with the weak action scenes. I mean, hello?! Infinity War and Black Panther both made over a billion dollars! They had time to do reshoots and rewrites, surely! There's no excuse for poor action, weak acting, or lazy storytelling in a major Marvel movie going forward. I'll be honest - the moment I saw that they were using the late Stan Lee's (RIP) Twitter account to promote this film was the moment I turned against this film. I felt disgusted for giving these corporate hacks my money and cheated that the man-hating Larson's character will be the new face of the MCU going forward. Whatever happened to all the characters we invested so much time and love in? Whatever happened to treating your fans with respect?I'm going to see Endgame for sure, but after that, I don't know anymore... I'm getting burned out on these cookie-cutter films.",0
675,"What do you get when you cross Green Lantern, a boring script, and a feminist agenda? Captain Marvel of course! This movie was painful, I suppose it's worth seeing at some point since it does kind of setup End Game, but my God it was bad.",0
676,"2° pior filme de todo MCU, só conseguiu ser melhor que o 1° hulkA personagem é uma batata, cuja interpretação é perfeita pois a atriz é uma batata tbm, imbecilizaram todos ao redor dela a ponto do NICK FURI parecer bobo",0
677,"The movie was bad with some good parts. The pacing was a mess, the plot was terrible, and there wasn't really anything that stood out as particularly interesting. I went in expecting a below average Marvel movie and that was probably the best approach to have. I'll also keep this as a footnote, but the inserted politics didn't do the movie any favors and actually made the movie more enjoyable in the bad way. Scenes flow very quickly with hardly any stops to get invested in what is going on. There was a pretty consistent pattern of wasted tension any time things did slow down, including a disappointing 3rd act when confronting the big bad guy. Also as much as I enjoy Goose the cat, the writers use it as an out to conflict several times which feels cheap and unearned. Captain Marvel is invincible. Even while human, she shrugged off the crash of a plane using a prototype light speed engine which still wasn't enough for this masochist, so she proceeded to shoot the engine point blank for it to blow up in her face. Somehow the universe rewards her with superpowers for this attempted suicide. All the scenes showing her growing up and being put down by men were all pretty funny because it was usually partnered with footage of her failing, including her crashing into a wall after being told to slow down while driving a go kart. He wasn't talking down to you, he was just telling you to drive safely. This is also consistent with how she acts as an adult since when she fails then, she immediately uses her powers to get her way. Got bested in a friendly sparring match? Take a cheap shot when on the ground and launch them across the room. Such a noble and likable character. Carol was also extremely stiff throughout the movie, only going through the motions rather than actually expressing any emotion. It was fun to laugh at some of the choices made, like the music selection for some fight scenes, but I wouldn't want to watch it again.",0
678,"Twisted storytelling ruins movie. I'm all for nonlinear approaches to origin stories, but clearly this approach didn't work. I just can't believe the producers and the director looked at the script and decided that it was ready to make.As for Brie Larson, when you see her in a scene with Annette Bening, it's hard to believe Larson's the one who got the Oscar! And the overuse of 90s music was nauseating.",0
679,"My family and I walked in with high expectations for Captain Marvel, and we walked out very disappointed. I don't know if it was the distortion of her origins or the way Disney/Marvel portrait the male antagonist character as a weak figure trying to keep Captain Marvel down. Their relationship is portrayed like a couple were the man is keeping the woman down and it wasn't until she leaves him that she finds her real power. This movie is trying to channel the energy of Wonder Woman, but it is missing the heart that made Wonder Woman so compelling and for that reason, it fails at delivering and connecting with the audience. The one bright spot is Samuel L. Jackson's, Nick Fury. He is the one redeeming part of this movie. He is funny and engaging.  I only hope they can redeem this character in the upcoming Avenger: Endgame or Disney/Marvel would've squandered one of the most powerful and complex characters in their roster.",0
680,"I haven't watched the movie, the feminist movement ruins it. I get the inevitable feeling, that it is a propaganda movie.",0
682,"I saw this movie expecting it to be just average, and I was still disappointed. It could have been done on Marvel's auto-pilot script writer, had nothing stand out and it would have at least been forgivable at that point. However, that was not the case. There are multiple plot holes introduced into the greater Marvel universe now as a result of events in this movie. Completely unnecessary ones at that. Rather than rant about what I disliked specifically, here are some pros & cons.Pros -Nick Fury (Always good)Jude Law (He was OK)Cons -Brie Larson. Captain Marvel's character was completely flat, nothing interesting about her as a person whatsoever. They could have cast almost anyone else and it would have been better. I've never disliked her in other movies, but she just really fell short here. At first I thought maybe the writing for her was just not great, but I was able to picture black-widow or scarlet witch saying the same things and coming across much better.Plot holes. I'd rather not list them specifically for the sake of spoilers, but they are numerous and significant.Over-the-top pandering. The SJW vs. anti-SJW stuff aside, there were just too many moments in this movie that are just not realistic to how normal people behave that were inserted just for the sake of what was clearly their agenda for the movie as a whole. The song ""Just a girl"" was completely out of place in the last fight scene as well, especially since there were heavy stakes at that moment. It was just silly.    Awful CGI at time. Most of the CGI was great, as is standard for a marvel movie, but anytime Captain Marvel went full CGI, it was terrible. There was also a scene where they enter zero-G and her hair floats that looks atrocious.Argh.. I'm seriously worried about Endgame as a result of this movie. Hopefully that ""2 cuts"" rumor turns out to be true and they use the second one.",0
685,"In terms of storytelling, the film does more telling than showing to convey the ""strongest Avenger."" The first act started off strong, but by the end, we were left with a mediocre superhero at best. A poor lead-in to Endgame, but be on the look out for a much stronger Captain Marvel under the Russo brothers.",0
686,"Worst MCU movie until now, bland main character, the cat had more personality. The plot was bad, the jokes didn't land with the audience and the action was heretic and boring.",0
687,"It was a boring movie that looked more than a tv series, and not a good one, rather than a marvel movie. There was not a plot apart from how fantastic was Captain marvel even as a human and the end anti climactic cause in 5 minutes she just beat very easy everyone. The hero had no strugles everything seemed so easy like cheating in a video game and the main actor looking like a robot most of the time. The movie was nice only when S. Jackson was in the scenes.",0

Even the SFX were ""cartoony"" at many points.This story is suppose to ""plug"" into the MCU in some way.but yet some items and characters take unexplained actions for unexplained reasons.I guess to make it watchable they had to slap on as much ""paint"" as possible so there are a LOT of ""references"" to how and why some people and things got their names.I thought the first ""Hulk"" with Eric Bana was pretty bad and I even thought that the first ""Daredevil"" with Ben Affleck was pretty bad - But They are no match for how terrible Captain Marvel was.Captain Marvel is the worst of the worst of the MCU.",0
692,"Bad bad bad. A film that keeps the spectator disinterested from start to finish. The new characters that contribute to the marvel universe have no charisma. He only earns something when Samuel L Jackson comes out on screen, but it's not enough.Also, we must take into account the campaign carried out by disney for its launch, where they extolled the character as a symbol of feminism. And of course the location of avengers end game with so little margin time that it is almost mandatory to go through the box office. An intelligent movement for the business, but very ugly for users.",0
695,"This movie is bad for multiple reasons least of which is the actress. Plot Holes, Retcons abound. If this movie was on its own and not sold as a ""must see"" before Avengers End game it would get panned for as bad of a movie it deserves. Disney buying empty seats and the complicit critics helping it was not lost on those paying attention to such things. Had they used the character as a bridge to bring in the X-men fighting the brood it would have been a much better use of a character that is unpopular, comics don't sell and no one cares about save at one time Rouge took her memories and powers and she became Binary during that conflict. That would have been at least interesting.",0
697,"This review contains spoilers.Carol Danvers isn't fleshed out at all. Her back story is rushed compared to other heroes. Spider-man, Iron Man, and Captain America all had movies with character building. Who they were before getting their powers, what their life was like, and who was important to them.Carol's backstory is abridged in a series of memory flash backs that briefly skim over those questions while providing almost no context.For example, one flashback shows a child Carol crash her go-cart during a race and emerging from the wreckage clutching an injured arm with blood on her face. An angry male presumably her father proceeds to berate her and tell her that, ""She doesn't belong here."" she retorts with, ""You let them (the boys) drive."" This opens up multiple questions concerning Carol's past life, home environment, parentage, among others. None of it is answered.I feel like the writers were trying to create a Peter Parker-esk underdog taking on a world that is out to get her. The big difference is the antagonists in Carol's life are literally all men with a single 30 second stargazing scene with an unnamed male character (whose face is cropped out of frame) as Carol's only positive interaction with a member ofthe opposite sex.Without any context or answers to the multitude of questions Carol's past interactions raise, it's clear the writer's message to the audience was, ""Carol's life was hard because men were mean to her, but she never gave up."" This is a juvenile message and makes her backstory tragic to the point of absurdity.While Carol past is all but devoid of positive male role models, it's easy to find male super heroes with positive female role models in their lives. Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent, Peter Parker, Barry Allen all have female figures in their past that not only shaped the character but in many cases are part of what motivates them to be super heroes. A protagonist's ability to love another is what makes them realistic and resonate as being human.Carol on the other hand has no beacon of hope in her life. Being an amnesiac, all of her interactions with anyone from her past are superficial at best. While her male counter-parts fight for their loved ones, humanity, or justice, Carol seems to be driven by a single minded desire to prove her haters wrong. This negative, narcissistic motivator does not encourage the audience to root for her.As we continue on the film seems to take every opportunity to denigrate men or portray them in the worst possible light. A random motorcyclist exhibiting 'toxic masculinity' by asking Carol to ""give him a smile."" Maria threatens a male alien who dares to refer to her as ""Young lady.""Carol and Maria femsplain how spacial coordinates work to male space faring aliens. Carol's single father is portrayed as an abusive dead-beat dad, while Monica's single mother is shown to be a loving, strong, independent woman.Even Nick Fury, (arguably one of the most masculine male characters in the MCU) is the victim of a tasteless joke involving the origin of his eye patch for no other reason than to emasculate the character.For a movie that claims to be feminist, what does that say when the female characters are dependent on repeatedly one-upping men in order to look good by comparison?If the feminist propaganda wasn't bad enough, Carol Danvers is rampant with Mary Sue traits.She has an absurdly tragic past.She has amnesia which allows her to conveniently remember past skills or information to forward the story.She doesn't have trouble acclimating to earth society despite living among Kree most her life.She escapes a mental prison by sheer force of will.Her pilot call sign is Avenger, the name Fury used for the Avengers Initiative.She is captured by Skrull only to effortlessly escape while taking on twenty opponents and not breaking a sweat. This makes it clear she was only ""captured"" as a cheap way to learn about her past.Another fight scene has ""I'm just a girl"" by No Doubt playing over it. The girl-power estrogen fueled message couldn't get more unsubtle and obnoxious if they changed the movie title to Captain Marvel: Girls Rule, Boys Drool.Captain Marvel is a film suffering from terrible writing, terrible casting and horrid acting on the part of Brie Larson. It lacks anything resembling tension or suspense. Carol briskly walks from one victory to the next to pander to female audience members by giving them a female character who effortlessly defeats her opposition and is without flaws. Finally the complete absence of positive male supporting characters and the unrealistically toxic interactions between the sexes in Captain Marvel feels like a very calculated move on the part of the writers. It speaks volumes about both the type of feminism the movie espouses, and what young girls should take away from the film. None of it is positive.",0

700,"Before you watch this movie: if you HATE SJW bs shoved down your throat, then don't watch it. With that out of the way, here i my review. Brie Larson, is awesome, I really liked her performance and I did not doubt her acting for a moment.Nick Fury, is simply there to make some jokes, be slammed around by more powerful heroes and simply be useless for the entire movie. How dare you waste Nick Fury like that?The amount of feministic comment in this movie is absurd, from making well sure you know that Cap Marvel is this Tomboy, rough, rebellious, grungy ""chick"" to a constant theme of how opressed she really is and how she must realise her true strength to break free of opression. Marvel, STOP.Why does she deserve to be the most powerful hero in all of Marvel? Honestly, what does she do that is so amazing. She ""discovers"" herself. Good for you! I can find self help bs myself thank you, I came to watch a superhero movie.The worst is thinking about the movie logically, don't. You will most probably physically hurt your brain.In conclusion, as we all probably know Cap Marvel aka women power is going to defeat Thanos in the most disappointing end to a series one could imagine. Why does the SJW's always bloody take over? Please, let us just have our joy without infecting everything and try to control our thoughts and beliefs with this incompetent toxicity.",0
701,"Atriz sem expressão, fiz não tem muita história, protagonista sem carisma.",0
702,"Boring, bland movie. My recently generated negative bias against Larson made it even worst. I have watched a few superhero movies and this one is, by far, the only one that I thought was bad. Some of them were mediocre but Captain  Boredom was just on a whole different level. Disney already tried to push their SJW, feminist agenda on the Star Wars movies they did and they successfully destroyed the franchise I once loved. Be careful MCU fans, this is the beginning of the end. This is the result of trying to push a political agenda in an entertainment product and have your main actress bad mouthing half of their audience.If you want to see a decent superhero-ish movie, go watch Alita: Battle Angel. It might not be the best of the best but I can assure something: it doesn't shove SJW agendas up your ass and it's actually fun to watch.",0
703,"It was OK, I just had higher expectations for a Marvel movie.  The main character was not very expressive, kind of just always had the movie poster face on the whole time.  The story was not particularly great, kinda just an average trope.  I think I just expected more from Marvel, but it does make me kind of worried for End Game.  However, only time will tell.  I was disappointed in the movie overall I was pretty hype for it.",0
704,"Not good at all. this movie is a misstep of Marvel... lead role was miscast.Sam Jackson manages to sometime elevate her acting a bit when they are together, but it's just not working otherwise.Only thing good about this movie is the 90's nostalgia bits (even tho it's overdone), Sam Jackson and the cat.Action sucks, story very mediocre.",0
705,Imagine being so powerful you destroy an entire franchise with a single choice.,0
706,"Captain Marvel is the weakest movie of the Marvel Universe so far. I would put it below even Ant Man or Iron Man 3.It tries to be a movie that pushes diversity and does a political statement. Ironically the writers do such a bad job at this that the only way they try to do this is portraying men as douches and making Carol Danvers as masculine as they can, using general awful tropes of what a man is: stoic, out of touch with her feelings and condescending.This makes really hard to create an emotional connection with the character.The story is bland, there is no hero journey for Carol Danvers, she is perfect and overpowered and each time  she needs to improve she just do it, without any real effort. It is the definition of Mary Sue.The action is not that good, nor that bad. The worst part is the cgi, that seems quite outdated.Other problems comes from the story and coherence in the universe, like choose to make a particular race of aliens good instead of bad just for the sake of the plot twist, introducing some issues to the universe canon.Also, it was hinted this movie will be highly tied to Avengers Endgame. It is not. There are some parts related to pre Infinity War events, but that is all.Perhaps the most concerning part is that an origin movie has 2 other characters that are more enjoyable than the new hero. One being Fury that was sadly used as a comic relief and the other a cat. When a cat is more expressive and fun than the main character you have a problem.",0
707,"This is the first Marvel movie that I was checking my watch wondering when it was going to end (I thought it was an 1 1/2 hr already, it was 30 mins in).  For me, that is a sign of a movie that has problems.  Jackson was ok, but the lead just didn't do it for me, she was meh and the script was meh.  Perhaps if they put Jackson in a wig he could've saved the movie as Captain Marvel?",0
708,"I was sad to see that the trailer was pretty much spot on in regards to the performance of Brie Larson. Boring and uninteresting (and *uninterested* it seems), she just doesn't engage the same way as other contemporary superheroine portrayals. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Alita: Battle Angel (Rosa Salazar) both deliver far more riveting and passionate performances.Despite solid performances by fan-favorites Jackson and Gregg, Captain Marvel is the weakest Marvel movie so far. It's quite surprising Marvel is betting on Larson's Captain Marvel to be their new flagship hero, much like Robert Downey's Iron Man has been since the birth of the MCU.",0
709,Pretty shallow and boring movie. Fell asleep in the first half of the movie. The second half was better but still not good. It is not worth the ticket price.,0
710,"Brie Larson sure was honest about one thing about this movie, and that was this movie was not for me. Acting from Brie as main star was so unhuman and had little emotions. Other actors did a decent effort.Story and character development was pretty much nonexistant and dull.CGI was also cheaper looking than previous MCU movies I have seen so far.And her being so overpowered, makes her uninteresting to get involved it as you know she will never be in peril and need other MCUs help.If Carol Danvers is supposed to be the new shining character for youngsters to look up to, then we are heading into an even more entitled future.If you want a badass strong character to respect, go watch Alita Battle Angel instead. This movie makes me scared for Endgame and future MCU movies coming. I hope it doesnt become another The Last Jedi :(",0
711,"It seems like they coasted on ""People will see it to support a female superhero movie"" and didn't try that hard to make it great.You can wait for it to hit Netflix or Redbox honestly.",0

713,"Very generic and boring. I had a little hope that this will not suck, was totally wrong.",0
714,"Ok movie.. not a good script boring at time but good cgi, out of all the marvel movies this one is the worst!!",0
715,Craptain Marvel definitely lives up to its name. This movie is a bore & heresy to MCU.,0
717,"Brie Larson is horribly miscast, her attempts at being ""spunky"" feel awkward, forced and unlikable. Her playfulness feels aggressive and defensive instead of innocent. A part of it - but not all - is her face. I think she has a very unfortunate facial structure that just doesn't really allow her to carry this kind of ""high status female""/vamp charisma the role would require, and her acting does not come close to compensating for it either, with her mostly seeming like her real life self that can't find the balance between genuine banter and arrogance, usually trending towards the latter.The feminism stuff (including the marketing) annoys, the jabs at immigration - while sacrificing the source material - annoy as well (which is basically the entire storyline), her powers feel very unearned within the context of the MCU and also aren't properly explained. In particular, humans aren't supposed to be able to withstand the power of an Infinity Stone. I guess a lot of it could be more forgivable if it was a completely standalone movie in its own universe, but that's not what it is and not what it is marketed as either.I admit it's not as bad as I expected - my expectations were indeed extremely low. The movie execution still shows baseline competence that I guess you can expect from a Disney production, it's not a complete disaster in every way like Ghostbusters 2016 was. They likely have so many experienced people in the technical department that even some flaws in the story, acting and direction cannot throw it off. The cinematography seemed okay to me, but I'd have to see it again. Incidentally, that's the one part they didn't diversity-hire a woman for. But it was still not good at all in the end. I suppose a good analogy is The Last Jedi, which had very related flaws, but still was nice to watch due to Disney's technical competence.",0
718,"You know its serious when I have to ask my son to help me make a metacritics account just to voice my opinions on the movie cause the depressing car ride home after the theater premiere was depressing as my daughters and my son all had something either displeasing or flat out saying ""that was a waste of money."" cause it honestly was.",0
719,"My expectations were low, and I was still disappointed.  There were a lot of flaws with this.   A lot that felt out of place.  Honestly, Sam Jackson felt like he was Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss Daisy.  In every scene they were together it felt as if Fury was just the focal point cause he had to be.  At no point in the movie did I feel like Larsen was a focal point.  No scenes really made me feel that she was this omnipotent defeater of Thanos.  It felt like they retconned the entirety of their implied universe.  There was so much that didn't make sense.  So the Skrulls are now misunderstood victims? What? Mar-Vell was a woman who had the tesseract on earth to save the Skrulls? Larsen never spoke, never gave a triumphant speech, never took center stage at all.  She felt like a side character in her own movie.  She didn't steal any scenes at all.  The bland crescendo flying through space destroying things while Ronan cowardly left was incredulous.  He stood up to Thanos, DEFIED THANOS and he cowers to her? I do not understand the point of this movie.  It was poorly formulated, mediocre and just left me indifferent.  I didn't hate it, didn't love it, just meh.",0
720,"This could have been a good movie, it had the Marvel production team behind it and we could have done with a strong and fresh female lead character. Why then did it end up with so many poor decisions? From the get go the main character lacks a distinct and appealing personality. She begins already stronger than any of her companions (and levels up in power twice during the movie) and essentially waltzes through the movie without suffering any physical, mental or emotional challenges (not that this would have been easy to tell given how wooden the main actress is, her face is botox level rigid throughout). All they had to do was humanize her a little, have her get her ass kicked during the early stages of the film, have her be desperately running for her life when she gets to earth instead of strolling casually around as though she's at the mall. There's no sense of urgency or passion at all from the character and though they heavy-handily shoe-horn in some dramatic 'hero' moments (e.g. doing the rising from the dirt, brushing the dust off thing) there is absolutely no sense either that she has earned it or that she has the moral integrity to deserve such power. The film and character can't help but be compared to Captain America, a movie in which the main character shows his spirit as a stick thin weakling, willing to take a beating for his principles (and get back up again), throw himself on a grenade to save people who mocked him, and use his brains where others use superior physical power. The movie did a fantastic job of showing why he was a hero outside of his super-powers. Setting all this aside the movie also suffers from plot-holes, terrible music choices that clash badly with their scenes, and humor that falls way below Marvels usual standard. This could well be the weakest offering in the MCU and leaves me hoping any cameo in Infinity War is brief and unimportant.",0
721,"I've been a Marvel Fan since I bought the comics as a Kid.  My wife enjoys most of the Marvel movies but only started watching them because of me. Also, we're not a fan of the DC movies but we loved Wonder Woman. That was a great movie. With all the backlash against the Marketing of Captain Marvel I took my wife to see the movie without giving her any background info.Her reaction to the movie was, ""it was ok. I liked the cat."" and ""They really laid the Girl Power message on thick.""  When the pet cat is the best part of a Superhero flick you know the movie is bad.  Now with all that said, I thought the movie was ****  It was not remotely true to the source material and Brie Larson was horrible. I have a skin tag in my left arm pit that has more personality and acting range than she does.  After watching the movie, all the conspiracy theories about Captain Marvel beig a Mary Sue that is being shoe horned into the MCU are confirmed. One of the last scenes, which is meant to get us excited for Endgame, did the exact opposite for me. That scene was cringey and has me worried that Captain marvel is going to ruin Endgame. The thought of Brie Larson as Captain marvel in an Avengers movie has me seriously worried about Endgame and my desire to see Endgame has decreased.  That is something I did not think was possible.",0
722,Predictable and boring. Definitely not another wonder woman sadly. Save your money.,0
723,"I was kinda forced to watch this movie and I went in thinking that I was going to hate it. I didn't. I was just felt a little saddened by the whole mess and pretty bored. The highlight for me was Brie Larson. She actually made me finally appreciate Scarlett Johannson's acting abilities (I've never liked her). Anyway, I think that MCU fans and easily entertained people will love this movie. I didn't, but I tend to be critical when I judge my entertaining.",0
724,Derivative all over the place and simplistic not counting the overt misandry and lack of character warmth.Just an unwanted filler movie till the real film comes out.Endgame cross fingers.,0
725,"As someone who's been reading Marvel comics for a number of years, and following the movies since the original Iron Man, I can safely say that Captain Marvel is a low point for the MCU. Brie Larson's performance was bland and uninteresting, yet cocky and obnoxious which in turn makes Carol Danvers a very unlikable character. I firmly believe she was the wrong actress for the role.The fighting and action scenes were decent(as most Marvel movies usually are). But the story left much to be desired, the film strays too far from the source material and barely even mentions the original Captain Mar-vell. Perhaps one of the dumbest moments in the entire film was Nick Fury loosing his eye to a cat. On a positive note, it was nice to see Samuel L Jackson as a younger Nick fury as well as Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson again and the 90's setting and music did make me feel nostalgic, but when the setting and supporting characters are the highlights of an MCU movie you know something is terribly wrong.For all the hype that Kevin Feige made around this character, Captain Marvel came up feeling very lack luster and even under powered, despite being touted as ""the most powerful hero in the MCU"". (She didn't appear any more impressive then Iron Man to me) Marvel studios should seriously consider recasting this character or removing her entirely, as her inclusion in the MCU at this point feels very forced and very very unnecessary.",0
726,"Rotten Tomatoes won't let me post a review, let's see if I can post it in here:Brie Larson is a skilled actress, regardless of her man-hating rants and her recent diving into the gender-wars. So when an Oscar winner gets out-staged by a cat and by CGI effects, you know you can blame the director and the script. If you watch Room and you watch Scott Pilgrim, you'll realize she has an unbelievable range. Actually, let me remind you that the song she plays in Scott Pilgrim she sang it herself, and did the musical arrangement with her band. So there's no reason for her to play an emotionless character (unless the director tells her to)So, basically blame this train wreck on political pandering. I've liked Carol Danvers for a long time, and both her and the Legacy Avengers actors deserve better than this. Here's hoping this doesn't nuke Endgame.",0
727,First one third is ... watchable and somewhat engaging.  Latter two thirds drags on and has a muddled and forced mess of unsubtle inconsequential phoned in plot points.  I thought the rest of it just dragged.  Attempted life support from the cast other than Larson really couldn't fix things.  How it defines critical points in the universe breaks what was good about the MCU like the Avenger name and Nick Fury's lost eye.  The blame isn't on Brie though.  The writing itself is lackluster and forced.,0
728,Dull and uninspiring. The lead character showed no emotional and personal vulnerability.,0
729,"More than anything else, the movie is boring.  I found myself falling asleep during the auction scenes.  Brie seems to agree with me since she plays this as someone who has no investment in the character whatsoever.",0
731,"Captain Marvel is Bland.Captain Marvel is what i have expected it to be, just another Generic Superhero Movie and an Average Marvel Movie, no not Average, more likely the new Thor: The Dark World.The Movie has no Style, no Quality and very boring tone, as the color filter is dull and murky, every scene is so uninteresting to watch, i think i do get that the is the MCU's Green Lantern, as the both have the same problems, except Green Lantern is Horrendous, the movie's direction is somehow mishmashed with plots, like her identity crisis and the skrull hunting, which it doesn't know where it'll end up, i liked the fish out of water element and the body cop vibe in the movie, but not enough, the acting is fine except for Brie Larson, and the dramatic and emotional parts of the movie really didn't add up to the essence of the movie, as the cause of underdeveloped elements is very present and so those scenes is just meh' to watch and sometime it felt forced giving the character's relationship unnatural and not that interesting, there are some good action sequence but mostly are forgettable, the Action Choreography tho is not that Good, its like the same action sequence would have in the late 2000s movie, the Movie's Visual Effects and CGI is fine, not bad and not great, its just yet Bland.The Title Character is wooden, bland and unrelatable, like Rey in the New Star Wars Movies, her being overpowered and the strong female character persona is the worst part of her character, because of that she's emotionless, wooden & boring to watch.The Movie's Plot is predictable and nothing new, it maybe a good movie if it is done right.The Supporting Characters is i'd say the only good thing in the movie, of course Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg, Jude Law is somehow entertaining to watch, and Ben Mendelsohn is fantastic, he is more interesting, entertaining to watch and gave one hell of a Performance, he's character is far more better than the title character, as this should have been a Skrull Movie instead, there are characters that should have been lefted out like her co-pilot which is the 2nd most uninteresting character in the movie, as her character is only shown through flashbacks and underdeveloped.ALL IN ALL THE MOVIE IS BORING, BLAND & GENERIC",0
732,So scared for end game now. Just a a bland and boring movie for me in my opinion.,0
733,"I just saw this film. I left the theater regretting that I did not wait to watch this when it streams for free on Netflix or Amazon. The film is mediocre at best. The main character Capt. Marvel comes across as one dimensional with little emotional range and not a particularly likable. The first half of this film felt like a made for ""TV"" or direct to streaming movie. The second half was better with solid CGI action. One problem is that this superhero depiction was very over-powered. As such I was not very invested in the story as nothing was at stake for the character. Also the character had no internal conflicts or realistic seeming obstacles to overcome and really any weaknesses whatsoever. The result was a meh overall experience watching this in the theater. TLDR: Do not recommend, or wait for it to stream for free.",0
734,"As a hardcore marvel fan, I was incredibly excited going into this despite the negative press... but the movie was incredibly slow and full of identity politics.

736,"Just watched it yesterday. i was not going to watch it, but i watched it for free. And i was not going to review this movie, but after a recent timcast youtube video decided to. He didn't like the eye story, but i did. This was one of the few stories i liked. Overall just about 30% of the movie is really interesting. I never heard about Brie Larson before she opened her mouth during the marketing campaign. Well, she better keeped it closed. She is too flat as an actor. And whoever did the operator work in this movie must be fired because they showed her short and curved leggs in whole glory. Look what they did with iron man. He looks there a lot better than in real life. The story is flat, too. The story in this kind of movies should be simple, but not flat. Final battle is the worst battle in the marvel universe. I hated the last battle in the civil war, but because of completely different reasons. She is too powerfull. Avengers can easily go home and rest in peace. The last bits of awful script almost killed me. She said she had nothing to proove. looks like females just need to have a golden v and everything else is put before their knees. Why than men need always to proove that they are worthy? Or maybe nobody need to proove anything? Whats the message, bro? I don't think this movie empowering females. Really. I think this is a very bad movie for females as any Disney fairy tale. It looks like that females can do nothing and have everything just because they exist. This is a very bad message for a kid. Hated by a lot of people, the first Ant man movie, in my opinion, was 20% better.",0
738,"Plot was completely predictable, characters had no depth to speak of. Larson was boooooring. Jackson helped make it a little more tolerable, but we really should have just walked out.I have seen B-Rated movies that had better acting than this. In fact, I'd watch the Mythica series 100x over before this again. For those not familiar, its an okay b-rated dnd themed movie (5 parts) that I enjoyed (my wife thought it was too corny).",0

740,"Having never heard of Captain Marvel aside from the original Shazam TV show, I went into CM with an open mind. I’ve been a loyal Marvel comic collector since I can remember. Other film incarnations from the Marvel universe have had their idiosyncrasies yet were still enjoyable overall. The acting of the lead playing “Captain Marvel” was lifeless. I’m not sure why the director/writers weren’t able to reach her. Encourage somehow her to demonstrate some semblance of a personality? It’s not like she was playing a Terminator! I was happy to see Stan Lee’s  last cameo appearance as it was worth at least half a point to see him. I don’t want to spoil it for those who have not seen it but the way Nick Fury loses his eye is not believable whatsoever.  I could not wait to escape the theater. Even the people I was with that wanted to see it finally admitted that it sucked. (Mainly because of the Captain Marvel character’s WHACK-TING) I really hope that Disney leaves Captain Marvel out of any future storylines as it is a detour from Marvel Comic’s future potential greatness. If you must see this movie because somebody in your life is blackmailing you, or you lose a bet or something, make sure you procure a designated driver. Watch it with beer goggles it will soften the blow. The other  half a point am generously donating to this review is for the  drinks they served at the theater. Unrelated I know, but the alcohol made me do it. Every time you hear “I got this” you’ve got to take a “shot this”",0

747,"I went in to this movie CONVINCED that all the pre-release political agenda fears people had about it were unfounded. I was wrong. They were right. The movie drowned itself in GIRL POWER YEAH!~gender politics so much that it divests Carol Danvers of any depth and dilutes the storyline, along with Ronin..SPOILERS AHEAD: 1) The movie was too fearful to give Brie any real flaws. She was damn near perfect and infallible. That made her bland. And it was bcuz they were scared of making a woman look weak or flawed.2) There is a scene where all these “evil white men” were telling her how she can’t do something or that “she’s just a girl.” Really?  That’s weak writing. Forced demonization of men to prop up a weak female character. If you have to disparage one group to prop up another, then that other group is probably not very strong. 3) There is a cringey scene of  FORCED male chauvinist remarks like that douchey male pilot saying to his female compatriot, “you do know why we call it the cockpit right haha”OMG RAPE CULTURE U GUYZ!!! 4) The guy in leather jacket and motorcycle saying, ""HEY BABY WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME A SMILE""Who talks like that!!  So forced. So much rape culture you guys!5) The Skrulls were clearly a forced allegory for immigration issues rolls eyes6) Ronin the Accuser was a total badass in GOTG. One of the best villains and most menacing. In Captain Marvel, he is completely ruined with one gesture from CM. Carol smacks her fist into her palm and some energy beams, which makes Ronin, one of the greatest and most daunting villains in Marvel's cinematic history, ran away with his tail between his legs. We get it. Carol is powerful. No need to ruin a great villain to beat that dead horse. 7) The movie deliberately refrained from mentioning that CM got her name from....a man. That's right. They GENDER SWAPPED the character of Mar-Vell so that CM didn't have to get her name from a man like in the comics...",0
748,"I almost never give a zero but this movie was so phenomenally painful to watch that I only made it 30 minutes before bailing. I can't believe Marvel put this out. I've been a fan of Larson since The United States of Tara and loved  her in The Room. I wanted to like this because of the broader cultural implications but I can't. It's so bad and, I hate to say it, she's bad (in this).",0
749,"Dull for the first 90%. It doessn't respect Marvel canon or even some continuity within the MCU. Uninspired acting from the lead, better from Sam Jackson and some of the supporting actors.",0
750,"I'm not going into spoilers but you can get a pretty good understanding of the movie from the trailers.  Historically I find Captain Marvel one of the most confusing in comics and unlike some of the other characters like Ironman, Thor, or Ant Man.  I don't feel like the writers brought all they could to this movie.  The rendition of the 90's paled in comparison to what X-men did in the 60's, 70's, & 80's.  The most I fear from this movie is that it will taint so many other established Marvel Heroes I've enjoyed for many years as Larson doesn't seem to have that team element the others do.  I put this in the same category as the Green Lantern movie.",0
752,"Worth watching when it comes out on Netflix or Red Box, but was a total bore when in theater. Most of the movie is heavily predictable which I personally hate. Acting is OK, but just OK, with one of the weakest characters being the actual star, Carol. There are a couple funny moments that land ok but a lot that fall flat because they are so bland. Overall I rate this a meh.",0
753,"A friend and I went and watch captain marvel for my birthday. Haha, the worst present I've received. Samuel L. Jackson wasn't too bad, fight scenes were not good, holes in the story, the Main actor not that good.",0
754,Good points about this movie are as followed: 1. Tribute to Stan Lee was great.2. Samuel Jackson did a great job as Fury as always.3. Goose the cat/alien was Awesome/cute/fun.and that's all that was good in this movie.Now all the Bad points in this movie.1.  Brie Larson was an actress trying to act like a super hero but her preformence was flat and borring and simple. 2. The plot was simple and safe for being a Marvel movie.3. Should have used Girls just want to have fun rather then I'm just a girl for the big fight.4. The editing seemed very slapped together.5. Most of the dialog seem monitoned most of the time except for Fury and 1 or 2 others moments. 6. Most of the main characters and secondary characters were basic.7. Not once did I ever feel like the Main character has in trouble or in danger of even losing something it was just OP story with no real point but to put in a character that's to OP for someone's reasons.Now this is not all that is wrong with this movie but I don't want to waste my time on this movie anymore.,0
755,"Went into this movie wanting to like it, but I just couldn't.  It started so slowly that it was painful to sit through.  Even when the action picked up, a lot of the choices in editing and music was extremely cringe.  Between lack of main character believable emotion, the lack of character development and the bad action scenes involving the aging Jackson. The hype over the cat was actually well placed though.  Before anyone says this is a troll review.  I am a Half Japanese Half Hawaiian Lesbian.",0
756,"While it was not as bad as many have been saying, it is not really that good either; especially compared to most other MCU films.Brie Larson's performance was not very convincing for me. Her acting came across as pretty flat for the most part. It just felt like she acting rather than living the character. That may not be all her fault considering the lackluster script an uneven direction. Suffice to say, she does not fit this role, in my opinion. Sam Jackson was great. Everyone else did their numbers. Overall there was nothing in this movie that really grabbed me. Despite some laughs and chuckles, I felt nothing. There was no rousing moment like the ""No Man's Land"" scene from Wonder Woman. It was just a popcorn/filler movie leading up to Endgame.Totally skippable.",0
757,The main actor lacks any growth and emotion the entire movie.  The funniest part involves a space cat. Retcons all over the place.  Just a boring movie to watch.  This ranks next to dark wold as probably the worst marvel movie in recent times.,0
758,"All the Political crap aside, the movie was OK.It's overall, in my opinion just a filler movie to tie things together in the MCU. Fairly forgettable story/characters. It says something about a movie when the most memorable character is a ""Cat"".It has a place in the MCU for sure, just nowhere near the top.",0
759,"Shocked at this one. Was looking forward to another MCU movie. This was something completely different.  Acting was bland, and often made me cringe.  Pass on this one.",0
760,"Well according to Brie if you're a white males review of the film don't count. Ouch. Eh movie. Out of shape character, for a superhero, with average delivery.",0
761,"I am a bit concerned about this character leading the MCU after EndGame. I'm even scared of watching Endgame because shes is in. After EndGame , I'M out. Peace Marvel is been a good ride.",0
762,This movie was generic at best. Brie Larson's performance was wooden and the structure of this movie was all over the place. Disappointing addition to the MCU.,0
763,"If you could name one of the worst attributes of a movie i think it would be not to be able to relate to the main character and CM did that brilliantly. It was a boring movie have to say it. This ""dull emotionless powerful noble warrior hero"" just becomes a more powerful ""dull emotionless powerful noble warrior hero"" at the end and that is the transformation. I was more interested in the skrulls after 30 minutes than what happens to CM. Samuel L. J. was good, cat had some funny moments climax battle was as interesting as if you would put HULK and Hawkeye in a room to fight against each other and yeah they succeeded in one thing. Hawkeye is finally not the most boring character anymore :P Good Job!",0
764,"Problems with the movie, not necessarily in order.  1. Nick Fury's character is too complacent/sophomoric for someone who is supposed to be a ""former Full Bird Colonel.""  2. Brie Larson took acting for this movie way too seriously. It comes across in a cliche such as the 60's batman t.v. series with the dramatic ""wham!"" and ""bam!"" thought bubbles when actions took place.    3. Definitely political undertones when discussing the roll of the Scroll people in the movie.    4. Huge Air Force public relations boost in the movie. Borders on puff piece.    5. A tinge of the male actors being overly cocky/superior and the females being the smart, ""adults in the room.""",0
765,This just wasn't my type of Marvel movie.  It didn't live up to the hype critics were giving it.  I could have just watched one movie instead of two last night! (also saw Alita)  Endgame can't get here fast enough though!!,0
766,"Boring, worst marvel movie so far, emotionless lead character,the story and the whole movie experience was really not good.",0
767,"Avengers were named after THIS? Facepalm... But that's not the only cringeworthy thing in this movie, far from it. And Larsen's wooden acting doesn't help a bit.Seriously, how much mockery you can take on your beloved franchize till you're fed up? Disney is the EA of the movie world, as if destroying Star Wars wasn't enough...",0
768,"Bree Larson is definitely the wrong cast for this film. She is carried by the actors around her, SL Jackson is just about the only redeeming (Even if they ruined the story about his eye). Fans of the MCU will likely hate what they are doing with this character and the potential effects on endgame. I can't recommend this for anyone, it is simply not worth the time (Even if it were free). I would have far rather had a Black widow origin story without feminism shoved down my throat at every opportunity. Overall, save your money",0
769,"Sometimes when a man tells a woman ""no"" it's to protect her, not to oppress her. Why can't bitter old Carol Danvers realize this? Captain Marvel is OP, her strength and power is unearned and undeserved and she looks bored at the end of the film as she mows down a fleet of missiles and space ships and then emasculates Jude Law afterwards. Tired of the man-hate in movies and media.",0
770,"Waste movie. It is better be release before Ironman, then it will be OK. **** . The main thing film shows that the story of Nick fury's eye and thanks for clearing that ",0
771,"Yeah, where to begin? The movie felt flat, the beginning and end had action, but what's in between was dull and weird.  Acting was as bad as the second Thor. I'm not sure if Endgame is in my future, as the purpose of this intro made me not want to invest in to this.  Honestly at times I felt confused as to the lack of acting from brie.  Was it intentional, non-intentional, sometimes movies people pick the wrong person for certain movies.  While I wasn't expecting much, the film actually fell flatter than I thought.  Oh and the SJW political stuff was thick, goodness! It's sad Disney has RUINED another franchise for a political ideology.  Seriously, if Disney makes something these days, you almost know exactly what it'll have and it's really turning me off.",0
772,"I'm trying to say something positive about this movie other than there is a ginger cat and Sam Jackson in it. Maybe the fact that Clak Gregg and Ben Mendelsohn are here too, and Mendelsohn I really funny. There are moments where Carol has a personality in the beginning, but the good moments are few and far between, mostly she is either wooden or sulking or trying to prove how much better she is than anybody else. To sum it up. If everything and everyone is more interesting than your main character in a superhero movie, han you did something wrong. Also I couldn't follow the fight scene on the ship, it was dark and cut weirdly, and the laser show afterwards just proved that Captain Marvel is too OP for the MCU. This is the Superman problem all over again. Why have anyone else in the future films, if Captain Marvel can swoop in and save the day without breaking a sweat. I can only say what one of my favorite critic has said. This is like a bland phase 1 movie. If you wanted to be better or even on the same level as for example Wonder Woman, than  your movie shouldn't just be ok. This is not great, not marvelous in is meh! This is like Solo for me.PS: Skrulls don't work like that. Now how will we get Secret Invasion? And the “avenger” thing at the end just made me cringe.",0
774,Fairly predictable superhero movie without anything special going for it. Ties to the MCU felt very forced - how is that Asgard has never mentioned the Kree in any previous movie yet they somehow have the tesseract in their possession.,0
775,This film has all the charisma that one would expect from a vegan. Captain Marvegan - man meat is murder. The writers and Brie Larson in particular appear to have had a vitamin B12 deficiency. 3.9 - 5.7 depending on how much you have had to drink.,0
776,"I wanted to like this movie. And I also wasn’t too concerned about the rhetoric surrounding Larson’s comments. So what went wrong? Well, it shoulda had a better script & direction. Esp when we've been treated with the awesomeness of Infinity Wars, W Woman, and yes, Alita. As a result, I think much of Capt Marv felt like a paint-by-the-numbers exercise. Brie was perhaps trying too hard (or forced by the script) to act tough. There was hardly any sign of vulnerability in her, thus appeal to her character was sorely lacking. Compare that wt W Woman or Alita, where both movies' story telling got you attached to their journey. Next, the editing was patchy - eg bar room scene wt Fury. And the action? A low on the oomph meter. Esp when compared to the fight on Titan wt Thanos, or the rush of Motor-Ball.﻿ The directors + SFX team should have created a larger than life character; sadly, that didn't happen. Perhaps they need to understand that a character's cockiness doesn't translate into greatness.  This movie will still go on to make bucket-loads of money, for sure. But only on the strength of its association with the MCU, and not b'cos of the character. Sad. I sure hope she does better in the hands of the Russo brothers.",0
777,Probably the weakest of all the Marvel movies so far is very forced and they want to connect with the avengers,0
778,"This movie was quite dull and boring for me. Not only that but it also retconned the MCU, but it didn't get the Kree and Skrulls right and it didn't get Carol Danvers origins correct. The gender swapping of Mar-Vell is a disgrace to that character as well. None of the performances stood out to me and I honestly feel like this movie is really unnecessary at this point of the MCU. I don't have much hope for the franchise in the future after what I saw tonight.",0
779,"Wanted to be entertained not preached to. Ms. Larson lacked fire in her performance. She never BECAME her character just played her ... underwhelmingly as if the role was beneath her. The de-aging process was amazing. Mr. Jackson was excellent as always as was Ben Mendelsohn. Having Fury say in The Winter Soldier that the last time he trusted someone, he lost an eye was neutered by the way he lost his eye in this film. The ""cockpit"" put-down was cringe-worthy the first time, much less subjecting the audience a second time.The makeup for the Skrulls was problematic most of the time, only good for Ben Mendelsohn. Making the Skrulls symbolic of our refugee problem might have seem an excellent idea by the screen writers, but it destroyed using the Skrulls as daunting adversaries as they were in the comics.Pedantic, boring, paced poorly ... I expected better of a Marvel movie.The MCU has given us 20 great films, only faltering with this one. Twenty films in ten years ... we were lucky the streak lasted this long. Thank you, Marvel",0
780,"Kevin Feige, Nov 22, 2016 (Variety):Why was Brie Larson the right fit?With Captain Marvel, who has powers that approach a level that we haven't seen before in our films, you need to counter-balance that by finding somebody who is also very human and very relatable and can get into a groove with the audience, where they're willing to see her fly through the sun and punch a moon away from a spacecraft. At the same time, we need her to land and have relatable flaws.Brie is a person you're going to want to go on this journey with, just like Benedict or Robert or Chris Pratt.########In short, Brie Larson failed miserably at what Kevin Feige hoped she could accomplish in Captain Marvel. Whether it was the direction or a failure of range, she looked as though she was wearing an ""Edgar-suit"". For me, this worked in the first act when we/she didn't know she was human but really fell flat in acts two and three. She was as miscast as Hayden Christensen playing Anakin Skywalker.I hope Marvel reconsiders her role in Endgame and MCU +10 because any character who can ""fly through the sun and punch a moon away from a spacecraft"" leaves no suspense as failure is impossible for the character, let alone portrayed in a way that is so unrelatable and, frankly, unlikable.This is easily the worst of the MCU. Without Nick Fury this movie would have been completely miss-able (and probably should be missed by hardcore comic book fans).Kevin Feige hoped Brie Larson could ""get into a groove with the audience"". She did not.",0
781,"All of the MCU movies are mediocre trash, most of the time. But this movie... This movie did the impossible: it took ""mediocre"" out of it and turned out to be just trash. This movie is an insult to humanity. Media tries to portray everyone who does not like this movie as trolls and white supremacists who hate women (or something like that). Quite funny, since I don't like all of the MCU movies. The reason why I hate this one is not because it stars a woman, but because the movie is trash. It's that simple. I hope this movie bombs hard. HARD! I'm out.",0
782,"Just a bland bland and boring joyless movie. Someone else said it well. Out of place, and just boring.",0
783,Formulaic even for a superhero movie.  Captain Marvel is without any weaknesses e.g. no character arc: just boring.,0
784,"The over 10-year reign of the MCU may just crumble after the giant misstep of Captain Marvel. Brie Larson gives a terrible performance as CM and the movie is bland and boring. Larson as well as the movie propagates this anti-white-male feminist SJW garbage claiming it's groundbreaking which is absurd. Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor, and more recently Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman made much bigger impacts with their charismatic charm and personality as well as being badass as heroines. This character and this actress don't deserve to be put to the forefront to be the new face of the MCU when all CM is, is a Mary-Sue character who essentially has no flaws. The MCU has made her over-powered, stronger than any of the other heroes we grew up with, and yes even Thanos. If she ends up defeating Thanos on her own in Endgame, it would be the least satisfying and most disappointing climax to what the MCU has built up to for the over a decade.",0
785,"Mala de principio a fin, pelicula parche que intenta insertar un caracter de ""grandes"" y exagerados poderes al MCU, escenas de accion pobres por la mala preparacion fisica de la protagonista y la crencia de uso de personajes como Furia(ridiculizado) y Ronan, distorcion de las historias de los caracteres como la obtencion de poderes de Danvers, perdida de ojo de Furia y charada de los Skrulls, ni que decir de la inutil presentacion de un gato y un personaje como monica que no le dan sentido a la pelicula y al trama, perdida de tiempo y dinero  , debi conformarme con leer el resumen de wikipedia .",0
786,"Ok, let's get this **** over with.Disney has once again shown that it is able to... do something... you might say this was made by Marvel... well, Marvel is owned by Disney. I liked Disney, they were original but recently they have created some VERY uninteresting movies. This movie is political bonanza so there's that. Also Brie Larson is dull.As always, have a good day my friends.",0
787,"I tried to go into this movie with an open mind and ignored all of the controversy around it, since I'm a huge MCU fan, but it turned out to be the dumpster fire of political SJW propaganda that actual real critics (not paid shill media, like syfy wire openly admitted) and general viewers claimed.The beginning started off kind of engaging, but then it just fell flat after. Brie has zero charisma and has one of 3 expressions during the entire movie (bored, angry & a smirk in scenes that others tell her how great she is), there is no hero arc or character development at all (she's the best ever and needs no one) and there is literally no threat or tension at all. Absolute tons of exhibition about things characters should already know (all tell, no show). The pacing is terrible, with long boring sequences especially during the middle. The ""final battle"" just had CM flying around destroying everything yet never in any danger from anything. Then there's the numerous breaks in Canon (ie the ""Avengers"" are named after her... Yet Steve Roger's debut movie is literally ""Captain America: The First Avenger""... Then the Mar-vel gender swap, cause she don't need no man... The list goes on).This movie is so surrounded by controversy it has to be mentioned. Never in my life have I ever seen so much shilling and political protection thrown up to try and save an awful. From rotten tomatoes removing 54k reviews to allowing (or using) bot accounts to spam positive reviews (hundreds of accounts with identical positive reviews) to actually removing features and altering the whole site, then YouTube changing algorithms reclassifing brie larson as ""news"" to push accounts like ABC (owned by Disney) to the top of search results, and not to mention the fan shaming with the usual SJW crap of calling everyone who hated it a racist/sexist/whatever - ist/phobe and more, because when your movie is awful, blame the fans... Apparently Disney didn't learn from their star wars disaster.This movie is bad.. Real bad.. And I didn't want it to be. Female superhero leads have been done before (no, CM was not the first, as much as they want us to think so) and done much, much better. Wonder Woman is a perfect example of a female superhero lead movie done right. I have fear of the direction the MCU is taking, especially if they shoehorn CM into Endgame as the Deus Ex savior they've set her up to be.",0
788,"Straight to DVD for this one. Sam Jackson porvided some buddy cop humour and Ben Mendelsohn(a fellow Aussie and seriously good actor) was great. Larson....no thanks - very cardboard 2-D acting. Preferred her best friend as Marvel.Overall, a bland film with only a little CGI to light up an otherwise very bland colour pallette, and very light on characterisation.Larson's political statements, socially political that is, don't lend well to her making her likable in the first instance, but that aside I think she's highly overrated and not a good fit for the MCU franchise.",0
790,"Disappointed by the plot, sure Captain Marvel is looking marvelous but without a nice plot to follow, with nothing at stake at any time it's hard to get hyped for this piece of entertainment. Maybe it's about time to stop the super hero genre and take some time to reflect on it, eh Marvel/Disney?",0
791,"This film is a complete and utter dumpster fire. The lead protagonist fails in every sense of the word, completely devoid of personality or charisma and much like Star Wars (The Last Jedi), the hero lacks any form of actual story arc. The film is completely shoe horned between infinity war and end game to essentially shove this essentially new character (with completely boosted abilities) down our throats (whether we like it or not). Even the cat everyone kept talking about is not worth mentioning. The only saving grace in the film was the little girl (which stole every single scene away from Brie she was in, so kudos to her). What was done to Nick Fury's back story is completely shameful. Seriously shame on you Kevin Feige for bringing what is essentially garbage to the screen. This film has little to no redeeming value whatsoever. Don't see this and save yourself some money.",0
792,ugh...where to start...she delivers lines like a d-list actress. wish they had picked someone (anyone) else :(,0
795,"Leaden acting, no reaction to anything except vague implication of confidence, average physique at best - what's not to like?",0
796,"The worst MCU movie by a mile. Sitting aside the political rhetoric that was involved in the marketing and later in the movie itself, the film had a host of other problems. The writing was mediocre, which is a shame considering the movie's high-profile, competent supporting cast; the fight scenes were not very well shot, with odd camera angles and poor lightning for most of them; and Brie Larson's performance felt rigid and stale. The story also seemed uninspired, with Captain Marvel's motivations not being explained or shown at all, due to this, you really do not know how Captain Marvel's character developed during the film, which my guess is that she did not. To be honest, Goose was the best thing about the movie.",0
797,"I don't expect much out of superhero movies generally speaking, but Captain Marvel manages to disappoint even such low expectations and Larson makes for one of the least likable actors I've ever seen in cinema.",0
798,"Poor writing and characters. Story is flat, with one-tone lead. Marvel can do far better than this.",0
799,"First off, the surrounding controversy, PR control, and the manipulation of trying to protect this stupid movie is ridiculous! I am blocked from reviewing this movie on Rotten Tomatoes, a site that is heavily protecting this film. They have deleted 54k reviews after it dropped so low. After removing them, it did not enhance the score much, and it began to fall again. Suddenly, it started to magically bounce up suddenly all the way up to 51%. Even more magical, the 54k reviews came back and brought it down to 35%! A few minutes later... They removed the 50k reviews again... AGAIN!!!A New Glitch (removes 54k reviews)The Reviews Strike Back (54k reviews return)Return of The Glitch (Removes 50k reviews)Now, let's get to this movie. Why does it deserve a low rating? Aside from bad acting, a bland story, a over propped up cat that upstaged Brie Larson, and the well known feminist SJW (Admitted by the director and star) with the illegal immigration politics forced down your throat. This movie craps on Nick Fury, the Avengers, and everything about the Marvel movies that it has been the last decade. It is the most entitled crap movie I have seen. ""I am most almighty power because I JUST AM! I have ascended to Godhood.""Plus, this movie has annoying and unhealthy demonetization of white men clearly in the film as she is battling the patriarchy of the disillusioned feminist. Obviously, what Brie has said against white men is of no coincidence. Her racism against whites is apparent.Stop making Mary Sues of these characters. Nobody wants to watch Mary Sues. They are the least interesting characters and worst story plots. This movie puts the political agenda upfront first above story telling.Brie Larson's acting is like someone watching a Kristen Stewart movie with her and asks, ""man, I wonder if there can   a person with less emotions then this girl."" Brie Larson responds, ""Hold my beer!""I forgot to check the only thing worth watching. What the hell did they title the butt double in the credits and who was she? Miranda Lawson, is that you? Oh, wait... It wasn't that impressive.Goose was overly praised by the critics who made him the only good sounding thing about this movie. He was more meh than anything. He was not that amazing. I don't know how these people thought he was that great unless you just think ""awe kitty!""None of this ties into the movie Endgame. It just introduces Captain Plank Face to taint Marvel and the Avengers. The ending credit scene is dumb meow. Nothing of significance.You torment yourself of boredom through the movie and never get a reward for it. You paid to be subjected to feminist propaganda for the next 2 hour of a boredom trip that you just want to end or get your money back, but you can't because you have one of those friends who have to watch it to the end... At some point, you wonder if it is possible to slip and break your neck to get out of this film. It is a bad movie.I also don't understand how these people are max reviewing it with ""It is not the best film, and it had a lot of problems. It could have been much better, but it was alright"" *Max Positive Review* What the hell is that shilling crap? So much fake! Well, here is one more MAJOR dislike.",0
800,"I really wanted to like this movie, but in the end I was disappointed. The Captain Marvel character isn't that interesting, and Brie Larson's portrayal falls flat. She's good in dramatic movies, but can't carry an action movie. Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, and a cat (I kid you not!) help keep this movie interesting. Some of the CGI is bad, and a lot of the action scenes, as rare as they were, had such quick editing and close-ups that you had no idea what was going on. There was also a lot of use of shaky cam. It's 2019, why are directors still using gimmicks like shaky cam? Some of the 90s nostalgia was interesting, until they kept hitting you over the head with it. Yes, we know it's set in the 90s, we don't have to get reminded of that. This is one of the weakest movie of the MCU so far. The reviews are fairly accurate. I'd rate it between Edward Norton's Hulk and Ant-Man and The Wasp. I only went to see this movie because I thought I'd need to know about the Captain Marvel character in time for Avengers: Endgame. But you actually don't need to see this movie, just Wiki her character and powers, and you're ready for Endgame. Now I owe my friend a nice steak dinner, he had recommended that we go see Alita: Battle Angel instead. Hopefully my review won't be deleted like all the negative reviews were on Rotten Tomatoes.",0
802,"Saw it last night with my 2 girls. Not the Marvel blockbuster i was expecting. Felt like it provided the same entertainment value as Thor The Dark World and Incredible Hulk. Captain Marvel was mostly boring. Highlights were Goose the Cat and Nick Fury. My girls aged 13 and 15 thought it was meh, dull, and were not interested.",0
803,"The hero no one wanted, in the film only SJWs could love, based on the flop of a woke comic... It is... Captain Marketing... Lots of loud cliches, kinda like a parody of a 90s superhero movie. Brie Larson's acting was wooden and the script was unoriginal.",0
806,The worst MCU movie yet. Bad cgi at times. Weak lead role. Rather underwhelming fight scenes for a Marvel movie.,0
807,"Went in open minded and even excited about a new movie from the MCU. This was an absolute disappointment. Brie Larson is very dull. Fight scenes are WEAK! The story is bland. Anti-aging CGI on Sam Jackson is great, but overall this movie is terrible. I expect more from a marvel movie. The way Nick Fury loses his eye is a WTF moment! Like WTF were they thinking there? The script is atrocious. Bad movie.",0
808,"They should have hired a better writing team for this effort… The movie starts out painfully slow. Unlike Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman whose character is expressive, caring, and inspiring, Brie Larson’s character is lifeless, seems to care only about how empowered she can show she is by not showing any emotion, and not only is not inspiring… but frankly is almost impossible to like. Often a character in a film will start out in a place where he/she is not perfect, but goes through a process of learning, experience, and development where by the end of the story they are a much wholer character. This is the human experience.  And this is why we root for them, embrace them, and why we end up caring about them.  Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel travels a straight-line character arch. As far as development she ends up exactly in the same place she started.After viewing this I do need to see something inspiring for International Women’s Day.I’m going to re-watch Wonder Woman tonight at home.",0
809,"The movie itself is very as generic. Samuel L. Jackson was one of the few shining lights for me, but couldn't save the movie its poor script, lackluster action and a badly cast leading lady.",0

813,"Larson was lifeless, completely wrong for the role. Marvel is going down the same road that killed the Star Wars franchises. What is Disney doing? This movie will put you to sleep.  The progressive SJW nonsense is sprinkled throughout this movie. If you have to point out how great the cat was in the movie that is not saying much. One good thing this movie did was expose how corrupt many of the movie critics, websites and youtubers there are giving positive reviews to this turd.",0
814,One of the blandest and boring films I've seen in years.  Waste of time and money.,0
815,"Well, just another over the top female feminist movie to empower women, or maybe just little girls/teenagers. Not sure why women needs to be empowered by every TV/movie these day, unless they are just that weak. This movie is boring and the first part isn't terrible but just less boring. Parts of it make no sense and then the feminist take over completely so they can over power men and blame them for everything. I wonder if these over paid actors think normal people believe this mess. Women leads are find and dandy. but this never ending agenda that has taken over movies/tv is ignorant. So, this isn't a good movie and is ruined by feminist agenda. I hope all the manginas and feminist are happy. They are too busy blaming men for their problems, but use technology made by men to do so. I have no plans on giving these people my money and good luck with your agenda in your own little heads, while the rest of the people live in the real world. By the way, when skinny weak arm women slap and knock men down, it looks just as dumb as your agenda.",0
816,Pacing and writing was off for me. Production wise TV series quality except the final act which pretty much saved it. It's pretty much a 3.5/10 but I gotta compensate since my review is being censored on rotten tomates.,0
817,"Putting aside all controversy that Brie Larson has created not only for her movie but for a decade-old MCU franchise, I found her acting to be flat.  She's a very dull performer who brings down the rest of the cast.  2019's Captain Marvel has a very predictable story with a lackluster script.  It's bad when Goose the Cat is the best character, but this movie is still not worth spending your hard earned cash on.  To anyone who's worried that there's something in the Captain Marvel movie that directly affects Endgame, there is not.  You can literally go from Infinity War directly into Endgame without any issues.The other bad thing about this movie is that it ruins the possibility of a full-out Secret Invasion movie (or at least appears to do so).  Save your money and wait until this hits Netflix or until you get a free Redbox rental code after it hits DVD/Blu-Ray.  It's not even worth a Black Friday $5 grab bag buy. 1/10:  Captain Marvel is not Marvel-ous.",0
818,"Looks pretty...But that's all. It is a dull fill in before Avengers. No depth, stupid twist that breaks the logic the movie itself wrote, drags by, and creates stupid situations then ignores them to trudge through the muck some more. Pretty bad when a human sees an alien for the first time transform into themselves and they shrug it off like its a normal Tuesday...",0
820,"Boring, never takes off, usual refugee alien crap even though the so called bad guys are made up of Asians, Africans, English and American looking aliens?.And the refugee Alien has a yobo Aussie accent which just doesn’t fit the role it’s not funny.Jude Law the leader of an army? lmao.Daughter of the supposed good side asks mum if the refugees can stay and mum says NO ????????? Even though they can change into anything they want. Isn’t their narrative to let in every refuge? Copies from Top Gun and Terminator. Car accident kills one of the aliens while Samuel L walks away then in the very next scene Captain Marvel cannot kill an alien with her fire hands and only knocks them over while before putting a hole through 20 inch concrete and killing 30 of them in a spaceship?And the super AI is an 80 year old woman who can hardly stand straight and has black rotting teeth? They talk about ending wars but they use and fight wars?I mean who writes this crap?Lucky I never paid for the ticket.If people aren’t more critical of crap like this they will keep serving up crap like this.",0
821,"WOW!! Could Marvel have stuffed anymore liberal sewage into ONE movie. We got your top theme drenched throughout the entire flick: toxic masculinity and we cannot forget the Patriarchy that has completely kept good ol Larson in captivity her whole life. Only Hollywood could throw a ship full of refugees just seeking a home and not feeling very welcome by anybody into a Marvel movie. Female empowerment is one thing but this is in your face toxic feminism with all the woes of the world on the shoulders of none other than(yep you guessed it): MEN!! Abusive father, traumatic childhood with toxic boys trying to tell her she's not fast enough, smart enough or good enough to be the best she can be; grown up boys laughing at her and discouraging her all throughout her air force training.  Oh I almost forgot, the intelligence of a little girl able to counsel her mother into a career at all cost; even if it means leaving  her child an orphan because gosh darnit don't men make those  flippant decisions everyday?! Brie Larson is a brutal actress and a mouth- piece off the set that only Disney could love. This girl says PASS on this feministic propaganda!!!!",0
826,Leave much to be desired for all the publicity that was given and fails to satisfy the public,0
827,"Stale and uninspired. The story is all over the place and it doesn't make sense many of the times.  (Cpt Marvel is able to communicate to another part of the galaxy with a 90s’ s payphone just by pulling out a few cables…) The acting is bland, the plot lacks tension as there is no real struggle, captain marvel gets her powers for free with no sacrifice or work. Out of no-where, she is one of the most powerful heroes in the universe (they should have learned from Doctor Strange, that’s how you get powers). Everything in inconsistent, the girl get her god-like powers from a frigging explosión… Her light beams are capable of destroying huge spaceships but they can only knock people back… it is established that she needs her suit helmet to breathe in space and suddenly at the end, she can breathe in space with no helmet… because of the explosión of course. Just a mess of a movie, IMO the worst MCU movie to date. And just in case Brie Larson reads this, I ́m not a white old man, I ́m a Mexican 29-year-old, I hope that means my opinion does matter.",0
829,"i dont know if it was me being spoiled by the other MCU movies setting a very high standard, or the movie was really not good. It was very dragging and it's as if lead actress was not good in expressing emotions and i remember the steven seagal meme were all his emotions showed one face. Funny thing was I just created my account here in metacritic to state how disappointed i was with the movie.",0
830,This movie sucks is boring the worst of the MCU the CGI is unfortunate is better green lantern of 2011,0
834,"This movie will make hundreds of millions of dollars no matter what I or anyone else says. As such, I don't feel the need to hold back, and am thoroughly disappointed by this film. You could have replaced Brie with several emotive pose-able cardboard cut outs and the film would be exactly the same.Spoiler bits follow. I have deeply ingrained issues with this film being part of the MCU. The Skrull, being presented as good guys, is down right heretical to my comic geek bones. Having Captain Marvel being the inspiration of the AVENGERS Inititive, is retcon bullish. Presenting Captain Marvel as the strongest player in the universe, is down right insulting to fans of the other heroes.Spoiler bits over, Up until this movie, I without question and with no hesitation went on opening weekend to watch marvel movies. Thanks to this film, and some disturbing quotes from the lead actress, I will have to pay more attention to what is happening behind the scenes when MCU movies are made.And finally, Wonder Woman did it better, did it first, and did it without attack people most likely to go see the film.",0
835,"Very slow and flat movie. As expected, a lot of feminism, specially in the first 30 minutes. After that, the movie was ok.Brie Larson's characterization is boring at best. Shows very little emotions and not from the lack of emotional scenes.The soundtrack was very good but the ""nostalgia"" music formula is becoming overused.The best of the movies was the ""cat"", Samuel L. Jackson (no surprise there) and the relationship they build during the movie. Unafortunatly it is not enough to save the movie.Good visual effects, specially making Samuel L. Jackson look younger. At the end of the movie was a little too much. In the final battle I thought I was looking to a DBZ (Dragon Ball Z) movie. There is nothing in the movie that is trascendental to the Avengers arc.",0
836,"Terrible acting and poor writing. There are aliens from another galaxy who apparently know how jazz singers move their hands, and the fight scenes were kind of cringey. The main character is unrelatable and we never get to feel that she earned those overpowered abilities. Literally, Fury and the cat were the only aspects that aint forgetable.Definitevly one of the worst Marvel movies, mainly due to the problems inherent to the plot, acting and writing; independently of controversies. Damn, a film about Wanda or Black Widow would have been a hundred times better.",0
837,"Wanted so much for this movie to blow me away. Left the theater disappointed. Watching Brie Larson as Captain Marvel was like watching a bad comedian tell jokes. Wasn’t funny. Wasn’t compelling. Wasn’t as bad as Thor:The Dark World,but still one of the worst Marvel movies ever made. I think the only reason for any of the positive reviews are from people in the media that are afraid of painting what is considered a feminist movie(albeit a very bad one)in a negative light. I feel like the movie should have been called “Captain Feminism:The First Bad Marvel Character”.",0
838,"It was pretty boring, I was falling asleep twice watching the movie, and that's in 4DX! I personally don't think it's Brie Larson's bad acting, because in Scott Pilgrim Brie was pretty good... I dunno, I just want my money back.",0
839,"A mediocre film with a boring lead. I'm a huge Marvel movie fan, but I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I've waste my money this time.",0
840,"I was looking forward to this movie since the post-credit scene in Infinity Wars.  Bought tickets to the Thursday night showing before the Weekend opening.  I wanted to love this movie.  But unfortunately, this movie was disappointing in so many ways.  Brie Larson didn't fulfill the role, in my opinion.  I don't know if she was just a poor choice for the role, or if the writers/directors are to blame.  Her character just wasn't interesting.  Basically a monotone Mary Sue.  Does not make for an interesting character... I also thought the jokes were not very funny.  Nick Fury made me chuckle once or twice, but that's about it.  The Skrull leader had some moments of comic relief, but even then, the jokes seemed out of place.  This alien antagonist is talking like any sarcastic human being, at one point referring to ""jazz hands.""  Just thought it was too cheesy to be genuinely funny.  He's an alien, with no knowledge of American culture.  Why is he talking like he's been immersed in American culture for decades??? I thought the reason behind Nick Fury's eyepatch was a copout.  Marvel fans had ~10 MCU films to get the ""crazy"" backstory to Fury's eyepatch, and we get the disappointing explanation towards the end of the film.  Whelp, now that's been established.  It's canon.This movie has no character.  No charm.  Nothing new to offer fans.  It was almost as if, the MCU forgot its identity.  I mean, Guardians Vol. 1 = 10/10;  Ragnarok = 10/10; Infinity Wars = 10/10;  Captain Marvel is easily 3/10.What's even more frustrating is the Google search results when I try to look up reviews.  It's no secret Disney has been playing damage control.  People are talking, and the genuine consensus is: ""The movie was very disappointing."" The Google results should reflect that.  I wish this didn't get political.  We should all be able to give an honest review without it being agenda-related.  It has nothing to do with the movie starring a female lead.  And has everything to do with execution.  I truly hope ""Avengers: Endgame"" does not feel the effects from the negativity around this movie.I've been saying this since it opened: ""Just because the movie has a female lead does NOT mean it deserves scrutiny.""  But also, very important: ""JUST BECAUSE THE MOVIE HAS A FEMALE LEAD, DOES NOT MEAN IT'S AUTOMATICALLY A GREAT MOVIE.""  Youtube movie critics have been doing an excellent job providing its viewers with honest feedback.  Jeremy Jahns and Chris Stuckmann, both I respect as critics, have given Captain Marvel ""C-level"" ratings.  This is a relief because I was starting to wonder if there were any honest reviews out there without Rotten Tomatoes claiming it to be a ""Troll Bomb.""  (The movie sucked.  Just admit it).",0
841,"Boring. Over-used plot devices, over-used cookie cutter characters. They even used the line 'We've got a bogey on our tail and he's coming in fast...' UGH. This movie looks and feels like it was shot in the 90's. Should have known once the hype machine went into overdrive what a dud this is. I want my money back.",0
842,"I’ve seen every MCU movie in the theater at least twice. Sometimes more if I liked it enough. This one won’t be getting multiple viewings. This movie had multiple plot holes. And not the kind of plot holes that don’t make any sense in the context of this particular movie. I’m talking plot holes that negate MCU titles going all the way back to Iron Man I and Captain America the First Avenger. If you are an avid fan of the last ten years of MCU movies, fair warning, you are going to be pissed. But sadly these aren’t the only problems I saw while I wasted about two hours of my life that I’ll never get back. Brie Larson’s acting is nothing short of wooden. Her reaction to pretty much every situation in the movie good, bad or otherwise is pretty much my reaction to this movie... “Meh”. Her character Is basically no character. They could have used Micheal Myers from Halloween instead of her and you may have actually had a more entertaining movie. The only saving grace of this movie is Samuel L. Jackson and the Australian actor that plays the “villain”. Other than that it’s completely devoid of any real acting. The other problem with this movie has less to do with acting and more to do with agenda. You are constantly getting smashed over the head with girl power and how horrible men are. There’s a whole lot of men acting like pigs which just doesn’t coincide with reality. Not because guys don’t act like pigs it’s just so over the top and exaggerated that it’s cringeworthy. Then it all culminates in a fight scene with No Doubt’s “I’m Just a Girl” which would have been great had it been done right. Couple these things with a character that basically has nothing to lose and yet nothing to gain either and you have a movie with basically no direction. I’ve watched SYFY movies with better writing than this piece of crap. As it is I’m just going to pretend this movie didn’t happen.",0
843,I won't see a movie where the main actress basically said I shouldn't watch this movie because I'm a white male. No thanks. I'll go see Alita instead.,0
844,"The only thing this movie has going for it is Samuel L. Jackson. I really wanted to like this movie. But it just seems out of nowhere. It seems forced. This is the person who is supposed to defeat Thanos? You think they would have eluded to Captain Marvel a lot earlier. It almost seems like they’re trying to repeat Ironman climb to the top but rushed. Like she’s going to take over. Here’s a quick story about here and overcoming some crap, oh yeah! Here’s Nick Fury and Agent Colson. You know those guys and like those guys! Here you go! Then the Elidong to Avengers being her idea? No! What? Anyways it just seems rushed and a script that is a little over the top. Now they’re going to stick her into End Game with seasoned characters to take down a major baddy. If this is the future of Marvel. Maybe DC will finally pull it’s head out of its butt. I’m just gonna waitbfornend game to release on bluRay.",0
845,"Brie Larson gives a strange performance devoid of any emotion, and the gender politics.... as subtle as a brick.",0
846,"Marvel Studios, celebrating its 10-year-anniversary of existence and its 9-year-anniversary of being stale, has produced this marketing campaign, surfeit of reactionary internet feminist cliches on Women's Day 2019, much to its embarrassment as a response to the relatively well-received Wonder Woman from 2017. Tune in if you want to see the PR folks lying about Brie Larson doing her stunts like the next Tom Cruise, even though she has two stunt doubles, lying about her training 4 hours a day for 9 months even though she can't perform 1/6 the number of pull ups the world record holder in her class - a teenage girl - can, or to hear ex-tumblr feminists put words into her mouth that she is hardly even implying. You may also see a generic bad superhero movie with canned action sequences cut like sashimi, an overabundance of wire-fu and a stifling, cure-for-insomnia protagonist that audiences would have you believe is no more stoic than Iron Man, Captain America, Spider-Man or Ant-Man. Anencephalous audiences only.",0
847,"do yourself(and anyone else) a favor and go watch alita or wonder woman if you are truly looking for a good strong woman character, this movie is the projection of how marvel/disney is going in decadence with its left-propaganda.",0
848,The casting of Captain Marvel (the character) is the worst I have ever seen in a major motion picture. The actor delivers a performance devoid of emotion and she is not helped by the writing. Marvel dropped the ball on this one. I am giving it a 0 since I wanted to walk out of the theater. Crossing my fingers they find a way to fix this for End Game.,0
849,"i fell asleep, so it is my opinion, that the movie is a complete bore with CGI doing most of the work, when does Brie Larson do anything but smile at the camera. was looking forward ot this film, but her powers are so over the top that it breaks the realism in the MCU.",0
850,its an absolute shame that they opted to politicize this movie a weak uninteresting character that's already been rejected by comic fans makes her way onto the silver screen and manages to be absolutely uninteresting the Mary Sue trend continues the real shame is the damage they do to their own franchise I find myself less interested in the upcoming avengers endgame as a result of this movie. I'll probably wait to see the avengers endgame until I hear how big of a part she plays because there is absolutely nothing compelling or interesting about this character or her Journey. they could have done so much better with giving a movie to the black widow or the scarlet witch even bringing in she-hulk might have been a better option. this was an absolute mess and did nothing but damage the MCU as a whole.,0
851,Movie is just too forced. The only good part was Samuel L Jackson and 90's nostalgia. Everything else felt too forced. Black Widow movie would have been 10x better.,0
852,"I didn't expect much from this movie and yet I somehow still walked away from it feeling let down. The movie is just plain old boring and Brie Larson (outside behavior aside) is simply wooden and lacks chemistry with her fellow actors and actresses. More than once I was left with the feeling that I was supposed to find a one-liner funny, but she just lacked the comedic timing. The side characters fared better - with the exception of Jude Law, what happened to you buddy? - and I especially enjoyed Jackson and Mendelsohn. The overlying theme of female empowerment is pretty evident throughout the entire film, with overt sexist remarks and most of the men in Veers' life telling her to slow down and 'stop being so emotional', a theme that reaches supreme eyeroll levels near the end during the No Doubt scene, you will know it when you see it. After 20 Marvel movies I have certain expectations of being entertained, the movie failed miserably in this one task. 2/10 from me.",0
853,"It seems, clearly, like the poor charismatic heroe arrived the marvel universe. And it´s definitely the most boring film in the whole decade of superheroes movies. I prefer The captain marbelle over this one! Botacachuchas prepago hijueputa",0
854,"It's unfortunately very apparent the direction this movie wants to take, and it's a direction that quickly leads this movie into the ground. Whether it was due to direction, or Brie's choices, acting was uninspired and the visuals were lackluster. Even the story itself seemed to drag on. Incredibly rough to watch.",0
855,Bad casting choice. Very bad countermeasure to PR crisis. Marvel (or should I say Disney) lost its footing. It no longer knows (or cares) what their fan base want.,0
856,movie was meh. least accomplished marvel movie. only good part was stan lee tribute in beginning and stan lee cameo. i am worried about endgame - hoping not to see this loser character back for that. black widow would have been a better character to explore. this movie is not worth the money to see it. first third of the movie is not bad but after that it gets increasingly worse.,0
857,"Terrible. Bland, uninteresting, and generic. This movie relies SO much on 90s nostalgia, and uses it to be the foundation of the movie. If I had to say if it was poor, fair, good, excellent, or superior, I'd say the following: that's a poor. Don't see this movie- don't EVER see this movie. The creative vision here was almost as blank as Brie Larson's expression throughout the film. A trainwreck.",0
858,"What a waste of time it is to watch this movie, Marvel is on a major downward tract now.",0
859,"Disappointed. The writing is so bad that Captain Marvel does not live up to her potential. Boring movie! Brie Larson was a bad choice for an action film like this.  She's not a bad actress, just miscast for this type of film.  Definitely a rental only.",0
860,Why does Brie Larson hate men so much? She is a stinking sexist. Why was she given the lead role?,0
861,Garbage movie. Stan Lee part was good though. This movie would have never been made if he were around.,0
862,"I cannot even begin to explain my disappointment. Brie Larson is the most boring actress I have seen since the Twilight actress, monotone, no depth, and frankly feels like she doesn't want to be there. This was far too forced and I really hope that Captain Marvel gets a recast as the character deserves a better performance than Brie Larson. I am extremely worried about Avengers Endgame as if this character takes up too much screen time it could ruin the movie and franchise we all know and love. Marvel! Disney! We don't want this! Fire Brie Larson and replace her with someone who has actual charisma like Felicity Jones who did a fantastic job in Rouge One. If Disney and Marvel continue down this path their going to destroy another franchise just like they did with Star Wars with the Last Jedi. Stop killing your franchises",0
863,"You'd think at this point after Infinity War and Ragnorok, Marvel would have the whole formula locked down. But with Captain Marvel it feels we've gone back five years. The movie revolves around a protagonist that I just cannot root for because Captain Marvel is so pompous and overbearing in everything she does, it's like she was trying to be Tony Stark without any of the intelligence and achievements to back up all the smug. All her powers felt so undeserving, she's not powerful because she worked for it or believed in the good of the universe, she just got it just cause. So with a flat character arc the movie plot itself then becomes flat as none of the villains matter. Which sucks because Ben Mendelsohn seemed to have really tried and was good as he usually is in most his movies. The de-aging on Samuel L. Jackson was pretty good as well as his performance, though not the Nick Fury we've known through the previous movies. The cat was cool except for *one part*. The special effects I'd say is pretty average compared to what movies can do nowadays, though after Alita: Battle Angel set a new bar, Captain Marvel's effects are nothing to boast about. Without an appealing main character and an underwhelming story, the movie truly was a bore and a waste of money and time. I'm still hyped for Endgame though.",0
864,"I just want to start by saying I can separate an actor/actress from a film, there are a few that I cannot stand but that wont stop me from seeing one of their movies. I don't care about Brie Larson, I really didn't even know who she was before this film I wanted to see this at the very least so I could give a legitimate opinion on it. That being said this movie played out like a disjointed, rushed and shoehorned addition to the MCU that falls flat on its face from the script, to retconning the origin of the Avengers to taking a badass like Nick Fury and having him lose his eye over Goose the cat, who people are right a cat, CAT has more screen presence and charisma than the lead actress. Brie Larson looked bored and irritated throughout the film which honestly made her hard to watch and it brought down the performances of the rest of the cast just having her in the scenes with them. Another thing of note is the ""talking points"" this movie promoted so lets break those down. Strong female character - Black Widow, Scarlett Witch, Pepper Pots, Gamora, Peggy Carter etc.First female led marvel film - Electra, Red Sonja (lest not forget tv which had Jessica Jones).CG space battles - Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy films.Feminist agenda driven film - uh yeah thats true that's your big #1.I really wanted to like this film I did. I don't care about controversy, I don't care about the ""man hating"" comments if the movie is good then I'll watch and I'll enjoy and even say so but this movie was so unapologetic in the worst of ways its let they set out to intentionally take everything the fans loved about the past decade of the MCU and spit in its face.",0
865,"Wish this movie would have been better. I can't believe the cast her for this role. I am shocked at how bad this movie was. Ms Marvel is a dope character, Carol Danvers has always been an amazing comic character. What did you guys do? and why did you do it?",0
867,"If this wasn't a Marvel movie leading up to end game there would be literally no reason to see it. I was really hoping that it was just the marketing that was bad for the movie and I wouldn't regret going to opening night. Well I was wrong. Brie Larson was very bland, the ""story"" was horrible, and the action scenes were poorly put together. The only good thing was Samuel Jackson. I highly recommend you wait until redbox to see this movie.",0

869,"I knew Brie Larson from Scoot Pilgrim and Room (which is great but only because of Jacob Tremblay's amazing performance) but thought this was an odd fit. I really tried to give this a chance and have low expectations. But the acting was just bad, not wholly from Brie but she is the lead. The story is paper thin and feels out of place with the MCU. all the SJW noise on both sides aside the tone is arrogant, self satisfied, and pontificating. All MCU heroes have their weaknesses... til Captain Marvel. Really I think this takes away from the MCU look and feel.",0
870,Total snooze fest.  Weak plot and horribly mis-cast.  Brie Larson has done well in more dramatic roles but not so much here.,0
871,Please endgame don't be this bad. This movie is pretty much Marvel's green latern. Nick Fury was the saving grace.,0
872,"Movie was pretty bad, lead actress does not fit the part of a superhero at all. The only redeeming things about the movie was the tribute to Stan Lee, the acting of Sam L Jackson and Goose the cat.",0
873,The acting by the Brie Larson is wooden and emotionless and lacks any charisma that other mcu characters had. The script is poorly written and doesn't work at all. Given how previous marvel movies have been solid this is a let down in comparison.,0

Cheesy attempts to tug at nostalgic heart strings wears off quickly and excessive CGI.  Someone go tell that rib she should know her place.  This is a man's world... like the song.,0

880,This movie is bland. Carol Danvers has always been an unpopular character that never sells well and has been rebooted like 9 times now. But Marvel still wants to shove her down our throats as if shes just as cool as Wonder Woman and she isn't. Brie Larson is the most average actor in the MCU and makes Carol Danvers as unlikable as she is in the comic books. Almost nothing important happens in this movie. Absolutely nothing we didn't already know gets explained here.,0
881,"I saw this movie twice, and all I found interesting was the darn cat. I really hope they work in a cat with the next avengers movie. I don't see Captain Meh sailing into success... If you have to choose a movie, I'd suggest Alita; Battle Angel. It's a MUCH BETTER movie than this one.",0
882,I really hate the direction that took with Mar-vell and Nick fury's reason for an eye patch.  This really felt like a stop gap between end game rather than a movie.... Should have waited for the AMC 5 dollar Tuesday to see this movie.,0
883,Being humble and not running your mouth as a lead character would have made this movie better. It's a shame such ideals are incorporated into what would have otherwise being an entertainment to get our minds off society and what some people are trying to force down our throats even though we agree with them to the moral extent.,0
884,"This movie should have been called Captain Fury or Captain Goose, because they were the stars of the show. This film has two major problems.  First, there's Brie Larson, who is simply not right for this role.  She's bland, dull-looking and dull acting.  Maybe she has potential, but the script doesn't allow her to realize it.  Look up ""Mary Sue"" and you'll know why she has no compelling character development. The biggest problem, however, is that Brie Larson/Captain Marvel is being set up to infect the Avengers Endgame.  This movie sucked out all the excitement I had for Endgame. Like this disappointment of a movie, I'll still go see Endgame, but my expectations are now set way lower. Bottom line is that I'd recommend you wait for Captain Marvel to come to the streaming service of your choice.",0

If your a long time follower of Marvel and the hole syfy universe you'll regard this as sick joke. A character that's completely rushed even they had years to get right made no sense in the hole MCU? Why, just to force feed us agenda? Nobody wanted this movie. All the characters in the MCU were built up over years and now pushed aside for a Mary Sue??Too bad marvel didnt take notice on how a good movie like Gal Gadots portrayal of ""Wonder Women"" was made.

898,"It was poor. First, it really messes with the MCU timeline and ruins other movies trying to shoe horn this character. But the first hour was so boring. The end was more fun but the CGI was awful. I will probably never see this again.",0
899,"Let me start by saying that the homage to Stan Lee was beautifully done and almost brought a tear to my eyes as I've been a fan of Marvel Comics all of my life and this man's creations brought so much happiness to me.    That being said, the movie: it's a forgettable debut for Captain Marvel in the MCU. It started bright enough with Brie Larson even showing some signs of charisma, something which was not portrayed in the trailers. Unfortunately, it went downhill as the movie progressed, Brie Larson under-acted throughout the rest of the film, I don't know if she was directed to act that way or if she simply missed the mark with her personal performance but either way, her performance was bland just as previewed in the trailers.    Another aspect that did not help Brie Larson is that the Captain Marvel character itself lacked any originality: it seems that the only distinct personality trait is that she's fighting a feminist battle to overcome gender cliches. The character is a caricature of the feminist stereotype and so is the portrayal of most men in the movie, they're also a caricature of what modern feminists imagine that men are like.Even Samuel L. Jackson's performance was weak when compared to his other works. I do have to credit Ben Mendelsohn though, his portrayal of Talos was by far the best aspect of the movie; that and the child actress that portrayed Carol Danvers when she was 6 years old.All in all, I do not recommend wasting your time seeing this movie, it's uninspired all around and it is not even required viewing for Endgame. 3/10",0
900,"I'm not a reviewer but this was a tough watch. Like a beta version of phase-1 movies. Acting was solid. CGI de-aging was crazy good. Banter between characters was fun.Action was hyper-cut. Story and characters were just bad. The cat was the best character and I hate cats. Slapping Nick F onto some random character and calling him Nick F doesn't make him Nick F. And then he's devalued, an epic character built-up over a decade into a scratch joke. With all the drama around this movie, hard not to notice that literally, 2 men in the movie are good guys. Every woman was a good girl.",0
901,"The good: Sam Jackson playing a young Nick Fury,he and Brie had a good chemistry, in those timesBrie did a good job IMO. Liked seeing Agent Colson.The cat was cool and I did like the soundtrack.The Bad:The story was not good and the tesaract storyis a little convoluted. The fight scenes were not very good, Danvers character seemed like they did not know her personality. Snarky?Funny? Mad? Brooding? I did like her whenshe interacted with Jackson but most of thetime she just had a cold stare. The whole skrull angle was serious cringe, oh I thought you were terrorists but turns out you are just refuges and you have been separated from your family, lets push a little harder on that agenda wow.More agent Colson please.Her getting her full power was very predictable and she is just a tad over powered. Once she has that power the movie should be over, there is nothing that can stop her and the final confrontation with the dude is a joke.Even with all of that I will give it a 3 because I am marvel fan, I liked some parts, and the Stan Lee Cameo along with the Stan Lee page flips at the beginning were very cool.",0
902,"Най - непосредствения филм от Марвел. Едиственото позетивно са поддържащите роли и ОК CGI. Всичко останало е 0. Като се започне от историята, която е слабо на писана и погледната от една гледна точка, режисюрата, която на всяка бойна сцена камерата се тресе и лошата актюрска игра.",0
903,"While there is a good effort to make a women lead hero, the hype wasn't as expected. What's worse is a side character stole all the spotlight instead.",0
904,"So, I dont know where to start. I think the character build up on Cpt Marvel wasnt there. She basically started off as a kick ass warrior and ended the movie as a kick ass warrior. The acting from Brie Larson was a little bit one sided. No doubt that she has a lot of talent, but she didnt fit the shoes of the character she was playing and left me confused as to who she was meant to be. There was no vulnerability to her, not relatable at all. The graphics was good, Fury was good, except for the way in which he lost his eye.. disgusting and disrespectful I would think. I will admit though, the movie was highly predictable and it incorporated a lot of extreme feminist angles and views which would drive a lot of people off it. Not to say other movies havent done this right, you have the Black Widow, Wonder Woman etc, but this was bad. Like The Last Jedi BAD.",0
905,"I wanted to like this movie so much, only because it's part of the MCU and I've enjoyed every single movie in this universe. But, I was let down. The movie is absolute garbage. Hated Brie Larsons robotic, motionless acting, and the special effects left a lot to be desired. Story didn't make much sense at all and the major changes to the characters compared to the comic books is an absolute insult. I damn near threw my soda at the screen I was so pissed off. Stay away from this dumpster fire of a movie. Should've just watched Alita for a 2nd time.",0
906,"I’m not even sure why this film was made after watching it. Overall, it doesn’t move the general narrative of the greater MCU along one bit. The switcheroo they did with the Kree was offputting as well. Without spoiling it I will say that how Nick Fury lost his eye was underwhelming, and that is metaphorical of many of the narrative twists in the film. I could almost without fail predict the dialogue, and that’s not what I was expecting from the same studio that gave us Black Panther and Infinity War. If you want to just munch on popcorn and blow a couple of hours listening to 90’s hits, this is your film. If you were hoping for any significant connective tissue to the upcoming Avengers Endgame, you will be disappointed. It’s not required viewing. Like, at all.",0
907,"Did all these ""Movie Critics"" see a different movie? The story line was boring/predictable and the acting was below average (even from Samuel L Jackson). The bad guys were underwhelming. All the forced jokes that weren't even funny, common we expect a lot better than this. And what is with Brie Larson's facial expression... or lack of... Really disappointed this wasn't amazing like I thought it was going to be.",0
908,"A poor performance by the main actress, much of the film taken up by preaching how white men haver always held women back. The rest of the cast make it watchable but the storyline is very so-so and the film is not necessary to enjoy the Infinity Gauntlet series",0
909,"For this untidy amateur script there are too many plot holes among which the Skrulls that came with Cap Marvel stand out, such as What happened to the train Skrull? How does Talos supplant the identity of the Shield director? How did you find Carol Danvers in Alabama? How did he get away from where they kept him together with the other Skrulls, without the Kree finding out and, to top it all, supplanting one's identity? Where the hell did Goose come from and why did he join the group? How has it been stored in a lunch box? How the hell does Cap Marvel know how to operate a computer? Sumale that the Skrulls and Nick Fury become a joke and although the latter take one eye does not change. The bad direction of the scenes of the battle, impossible to perceive what is happening?",0
910,"Marvels newest insulation to the MCU and leadup to the much-anticipated End Game was a total disappointment in my eyes. POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING! With that being said I'll try not to go too into detail with anything. So for starters, I think Brie Larson is an incredible actress however when it came to Captain Marvel it was a 2/10. I feel that when you get a big role as a superhero that you can't hold back for one second. All I felt from her was that she was just reading lines off a script. And when it came to acting as a superhero that she didn't embrace the role. When you think of a superhero (no matter woman or man) there has to be a level of gusto, which I felt there was an extreme lack of. In the movie no matter how they met her, they seemed to like her off the bat without her acting giving me any inclination that they would, based on her performance. The dialog in the film seemed like it was playing catch up and trying to inform the audience as fast as they could by having the characters constantly asking questions that seemed inorganic in my eyes. Now let's get to the inconsistencies in this movie which there is a bundle to pick from. If you are a fan of the MCU then you know who Nick Fury is. He is the stoic ""leader"" of the Avengers initiative that basically brings everyone together. Right from the get-go Fury is a likable and almost happy figure in this movie which doesn't match his character that all the other movies have portrayed him as. This is almost as much of a Fury origin as it is Captain Marvel, however, there is no character development for him. Even when he gets scratched in the eye by Goose he is still a happy person who still loves the cat. Maybe there will be more of an origin for him later showing why he trusts no one and blah blah blah, but the inconsistency in his character was offputting. Tying the two together, if Nick Fury wasn't in this movie then I don't see Brie Larson being able to carry the weight on her own film. It's super disappointing because technically this is her 2nd go around as the character because they filmed Infinity War and End Game back to back, then they filmed Captain Marvel. The fight scenes in this movie were completely lackluster. The fight against her old team where No Doubt's ""Just A Girl"" seemed so bad in my eyes. I don't know if it was because it felt like the mix of the song was in the back/wasn't strong/seemed thin or if it was song choice or if it was the choreography of the fight, but something was off. Plus this is right after she unlocks her powers and you're going to tell me that couldn't just shred thru them. They're saying that she is the strongest character that is going to help in the fight against Thanos but the guy with antigravity gloves puts up a fight? Come on now. Not only that but they send for Ronin and when he comes he sends a couple of missiles down, then captain marvel destroys them and he just goes 'nahh nevermind I'm out'. Where is the climax of the film, because if it was the ""Just A Girl"" fight then that's just simply disappointing. And don't get me started on the CGI of her falling back to earth, Jesus Christ man. All in all, Samuel L. Jackson was great, the cat was alright and when she got her powers that was cool. Other than that complete and udder disappointment. Captain Marvel was a movie that seemed to play information catch up and focus on making as many jokes as possible rather than drive a plot forward. Would see again to point out everything I hated about it. Looking forward to End Game.",0
911,"Mediocre film at best, but that’s probably being generous. The one thing it has is a great supporting cast. Action scenes are mildly entertaining but nothing special. What really hurts the movie is actually the lead role. Capt Marvel herself has little to no personality, and you as the viewer struggle to relate to her at all. They also went full re-tard with her superpowers giving her every power under the sun while at the same time giving her no weaknesses or equivalent villian to fight. Therefore, she has no challenges or obstacles to face(other than some sexism). Everything is just “super easy, barely an inconvenience.” It makes for a very boring protagnist. Now the question is how do you put an overpowered character like this into the group Avengers movie w/o making everyone else seem irrelevant?",0
912,Never finished the movie. I was so bored I left. Brie Larson acting sucks but I can't blame her for the terrible script.,0

915,"Hey you!, yes you!!!, have you seen the trailer for the movie?, did you think it was generic and bland?, well guess what, your guts are right, hey  look I just saved you 60 bucks, save the cash for END GAME, throughout the movie's runtime, you will be looking at phone for 60% of it, cringing for 20%, and watching explosions for the remaining 20%. This movie is a stain on Marvels Record",0
916,This movie is 2 hours wasted of my life Captain Marvel is boring and uninteresting they ruined Nick fury and this is a feminist film nothing more also this is easily by far the worst and most soulless marvel movie ever made.,0
917,"I was pretty excited when Captain Marvel was first announced; not because of the character, as I wasn’t a fan of her story in the comics, but because of the momentum of the Marvel cinematic universe. At this stage so late in the game, this movie should’ve been as good as the most recent Marvel movies but it was plain dull and pretty stupid. Even as a female viewer, I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the dialogue and song choices. Brie Larson was horribly miscast for this role. Academy awards mean nothing as we’ve seen with Halle Berry and other winners who are more than capable of giving terrible performances sometimes. The character of Carol Danvers was completely uninteresting and kind of unlikable. I feel a bit uneasy about Endgame as I know Captain Marvel is being pushed as a big player but I would honestly rather her role be as limited as possible. It’s such a shame the writing, direction, and acting couldn’t be up to the current standard we’re at now. I really wish Captain Marvel came out 5 years ago so at least they could’ve had a second go of developing a much better storyline and character that could fit in nicely with the Avengers.",0
918,"Brie Larsen is an Iowa 5 who moved into the big city and doesn't realize she's actually not hot at all, in any way.﻿ There is nothing “super” about transgender flat butt Brie Larson playing a hero which I’m sure the LGBTQ community loves, but unfortunately she has the charisma of a penguin. Maybe if this was a battle between Thanos’ chin and Captain Marvel’s Beluga whale forehead, then I could see it. It’s sad they needed a “butt double” for Captain Marvel, Black Widow didn’t need a “butt double”. We expect Captain Marvel to save the world, but it’s too much to ask her to do squats? Gimmie a break. Thor took the full force of a star to forge Stormbreaker... I doubt this Mary Sue can top that.﻿",0
919,"A mess of a film. Fisrt of all, Captain Marvel has all the weaknesses of an MCU Origin Story movie: bland action, cheap CGI, visuals that look like those of a Sci-Fi show from the 2000's and like 3 somewhat funny jokes that make you think the movie is hilarious despite the other 67 jokes being cringe.But the strange part about this film is that it screws up the things Marvel used to do right by this point. I'll start with the obvious: the casting. Brie Larson is terrible in this. She may be a good dramatic actress but she has the charisma of a plank of wood here. But in fairness, even a well-casted actress would have had trouble with this character which brings me to my second point, which is Captain Marvel herself. Saying she is a bad character would be untrue because she is not even a character to begin with, she is a feminist power fantasy with no real flaws. And this messes the Marvel formula: you know how the character starts out good, but kind of arrogant and douchey and then during the rest of the movie he grows and finaly proves his true heroism? This doesn't happen here, you would think she has a flaw, with her showing to be over emotional and even other characters commenting on that, but by the end it turns out she has nothing to prove and she had the power all along, you go, Girl! you make Rey look like deep and nuanced character.Lastly there is the problem with continuity. I am not the biggest expert on MCU continuity and maybe the movie explains this at some point(I don't know, I was too bored to care by the second act) but wasn't the Tessaract suppossed to be at the bottom of the Ocean with Capt. America by the time this movie takes place? Then why is it present here? Also, why does it say now that it was created by an alien scientist lady, wasn't it suppossed to be an Infinity Stone? And this is just the biggest problem, there are some other small ones like how Furry lost his eye or how the Kree said they will return to Earth only to ignore it for the rest of the series.You can see Marvel drones still defending this by saying ""it's just fine"" but if a movie with bad acting, bad story, bad characers and bad action is ""just fine"" I don't know what the hell is a bad movie these days. It seems that the MCU has finally ran out of steam after more than a decade. Let's just hope Captain Menopause will not be that important in Endgame so we can have one last ride before it crashes and burns.",0
920,This Frankfurt School nightmare is peak cuckery. Even the lead-up was a 3rd-wave disaster. To paraphrase Uncle Paul: it stinks and I don't like it. You won't get away with this for much longer. We're onto you.,0
921,This movie has made me very worried about Endgame and the future of the MCU,0
922,"I've seen all of the MCU films to date, and enjoyed them all (to varying degrees). Until this one.I wasn't thrilled by the press in the run up to release. I'm sure there are loads of actors I don't align with, but we all have our own politics. If you want my money, however, it's probably best if you don't go out of your way to insult me.But it's Marvel, right? It'll be okay? In a word, no.I didn't enjoy Brie's performance at all: bland and charmless. The humour was off (not entirely sure that's her fault and not the director/scriptwriters). Mind you, even a more personable actor mightn't have saved the day, as Marvel have decided to import the biggest headache of the DC universe, namely that the lead character is invincible. Sure, Superman can be taken down with Kyptonite, but failing that it's all pre-ordained. Well, of course, we usually know who's going to survive any film, but *in theory* they could die, and they all have faults that make them endearing or relatable. Not so with Carol Danvers. I'm genuinely worried for Endgame now (Thanos? No problem, let's call Captain Marvel), and really concerned about the MCU after than if Captain Marvel is going to be the anchor. Still, we've had a good run, I suppose.Story-wise, I didn't rate it. The script has too many holes for me. That's not necessarily a deal-breaker; I felt Alita & Wonder Woman had a bunch of holes, but I was so into the characters that I was barely aware of them. With Captain Marvel though I wasn't bought in, so the poor script writing was more apparent. There are also plenty of unnecessary continuity errors between this script and the previous (later timeline) MCU films - were these guys even paying attention?And the fracking eye backstory. Come on guys, Must Try Harder!",0
923,"Saw last night.  First, it was absolutely boring for the first 45 minutes or so.  Hardly any action.  Yea, its an origin story, but so was Wonder Woman.  I don't remember being this board watching that movie.  Also, the acting was just awful.  Brie Larson was a bad casting for this role.  There are so many other female lead actresses I would have liked. Remember how kick ass Emily Blunt was in Edge of Tomorrow?  She would have rocked the lead role in this movie because she has a tough girl edge to her.  Brie Larson acts like a brat both in real life, and in this movie.  Surely doesn't act like Marvel's strongest hero.  The writing in this movie was just cookie cutter script.  Nothing to keep you really interested.  Some action towards the end, but no enough to warrant the price of admission.  Lastly, and most troubling, is the constant social justice pandering this movie pushes on the audience.  Captain Marvel came off as a political indoctrination of liberal focused ideology hidden throughout the script.  I don't care what side of the political spectrum you follow, but when I pay for entertainment, I just want it neutral minded politically.  It just left a bad taste to an already flawed movie.  Wait and rent it.",0
924,There is nothing heroic about the protagonist - no real growth in terms of character and the development of how she obtains and 'grows' into her power is missing. Terribly dissappointing and not at all relatable - would not recommend.,0

934,"I'll be honest. I disliked her comments and saw this knowing her opinion of viewers (white) like me and ""my review opinion"". I hoped that this movie would be terrible so she would fail... and it exceeded my expectations spectacularly. It was crazy horrible. Just perfect... Just what she deserves for being the disconnected actress that she is. Marvel / Disney should realize they do not need to choose actors and directors on how WOKE they are.To the movie. Slow, I never thought Marvel would have fight scenes that had me checking my watch or hoping for a M Night Shyamalan twist where ""Ders"" would die and pass the powers onto that Black Rambo chick or the black daughter. Really, that would have been the solution to the issue she and Marvel created. Kill her off and give the powers to a black female. Brie would be happy (doubtful) giving a chair to a black female and we would be happy because we don't have to put up with her poor acting and off screen comments.Her acting. Or lack of. Maybe they said to her to play it like your an uppity space chick and everyone you are in contact with owes you something. If so, Oscar performance. Emotionless, know it all but has no memory, The throwbacks. I already saw Player One so the 90's throwbacks were many and constantly being thrown in your face.So, after you're dragged through 2 hours of slowness and boring acting you are treated to how she is introduced to the avengers. Sound exciting? is anything but. Google it.Save your money, watch it at home or some less expensive way. Or watch the CW episode where Super girl comes over and helps the Flash and you'll be just as happy.P.S. Goose and Fury are the best part of the movie.",0

Following the comic's lead, we have the mediocre bore Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel; no character arc, no charisma, over-powered, and over-shadowed by a cat. And don't go looking for a tie-in to Avengers 4.  You can completely skip this one if you're worried about missing anything for End Game.  Find a better writer and a lead more fitting of a superhero, then maybe you'd have a worthy entry into the MCU...",0

The movie takes too long to get interesting as well.Additionally, the suit is unfortunately NOT comic accurate - except the colours.

939,"The plot twist with the Kree and Scrull can be seen a mile away so I have no idea how people though it was witty... the cat is the best part, and it's an alien that eats the tesseract. Brie is wooden stiff and completely why I hope she doesn't have a huge roll in end game",0

The money wasted on this should have been better spent on giving us an Adult-rated Black Widow.Its good pointsSamuel Jackson, Clark Gregg and an Australian Skrull! (The only reson this gets a 1 score)the bad points (pretty much everything else)Sloppy directing/editing - All over the place and overlong, poor set piecespredicatble and poor/lazy scripting - Many scenes stolen wholesale from other movies (not hommages - Ripoffs. light sabers, pod racing, Indiana Jones) - the mid credit scene should have been at the end, and the unfunny and so predictable end scene removed entirely.

Must have taken the writers hours to figure that out!Calling said cat a ""flarkin"" so that they could use the predictablly unfunny ""Flarkin Cat"" line!Dark, as in can't see a bloody thing!

(ie wormholes)As to the ""lay it on with a back-Ho"" Gender politics - well we have Marvel's puppet masters for that!Unfortunately, this pointless movie reeks of Disney's ""influence"" and its neverending quest in princessifying the world. Disney fail to understand that Marvel's Comics (and by extension the movies that derive from them) are 95% read by males, yet D/M keep churning out female led books that struggle to get past 6 issues (Squirrel Girl and Moon Girl are being artificially sustained, apparently)there are exceptions - black widow/Scarlet witch.In fact, the MCU had the most powerful character pre-Snap. Scarlet witch was holding off thanos AND trying to destroy the Vision's gem simultaneously. In the comics, she said ""no more mutants"" and nearly all were gone. I wish Wanda would do ""No more kree Supergirl"" because that is what CM is turing into. Endgame will suffer from this if Ms marvel rescues the universe from the big bad MALE.",0
946,"This is the worst marvel movie ever made, and I went to the cinema with no expectations at all. The movie is literally sjw galore. Brie's acting is well... let's just say that lifeless and underwhelming are two huge compliments in this case... She was so edgy and without personality all of the time she was on screen, yet she acts so witty (not to use a more vulgar word) on social media but fails miserably when it comes to acting. Honestly, the cat was a better actor and displayed more emotion than Brie. To add salt to the wound, CGI use was such a letdown (average at most) and not to mention the script... oh my god the script... trying so hard to be serious and sentimental, the story is basically inexistent and any attempt to develop something was prone to fail miserably, highly predictable and did nothing but create plot holes. Any attempt to humor came out as cheesy.I don't know what people actually expected. Maybe they thought Brie's acting would bore Thanos to death, accuse him of sexual assault or something.Some of the fault is also due to those who marketed this (should I even call it ""movie"" or toxic leftist sjw feminist agenda?) through Stan Lee's social media outlets for free publicity and milk people for their money and spread some political propaganda for free.Anyways, I regret paying money for this. In conclusion, don't bother watching Captain Triggered. Marvel and Brie Larson can hold this very deserved 0/10 L.P.S. I'm a 21 y/o white male.",0

954,"This movie is boring. The main character has no development and growth throughout the movie. Bree Larson can’t carry this movie and has to rely on Samuel L. Jackson for that. Jude Law, Annette Benning, and most every actor were wasted. The material and the character is not compelling. There is a heavy reliance on 90’s nostalgia that gets annoying due to the lack of a compelling story. I felt robbed paying for this movie.",0
955,"bad performance from Brie Larson without any emotion .  Boring, bad acting. Marvel's worse film to date Together with the feminist propaganda makes this movie one of the worst marvel movies ever",0
956,Captain Marvel ends up ridiculously powerful and the way she gets her power is generic and stupid. After all the intricate and incremental world building Marvel have done I don't know why they would ruin it like this by dropping in a giant Mary Sue so overpowered she makes Rey from Star Wars look like a wimp. This pile of crap has killed all my excitement for Endgame. Infinity War was so great and the MCU was flying high but now it's FUBAR.,0
957,"absolutely disgusting. i cannot believe how badly the entire mcu was just disgraced with 1 movie. absolutely terrible characters, acting, jokes and story. jesus christ- this movie sucks. so bad.",0
958,"This movie is below average, but its thinly veiled political message ruins what enjoyment was to be had. The story reverses 50 years of one of the most basic elements Marvel canon that cuts across the whole Marvel universe, in order to identify one race as symbolic of the downtrodden and another as a symbol of the evil white Western Patriarchy. It is painfully transparent and dumb. Even worse, this movie completely destroys the character of Monica Rambeau, turning her into a cliched black child of a single mom. Even though in the comics Monica has a good father and becomes Captain Marvel, and the leader of the Avengers, years before Carol Danvers does.Marvel has gone and joined Star Wars in the insufferable department. We still have D.C.",0
959,A lame movie. Larson lacks everything Robert Downey Jr. has to be the popular caracter he is.,0

I tried to go in with a open mind and was met with Boredom for the first bit and Brie's horrible acting as a Hero. This movie just at times sticks it nose to comic book lore and the jokes fall flat in my opinion and that's how Nick Fury lost his eye??????????????BS!!! Its sad seeing Disney go down the route of Star Wars by putting out half backed insults to the fans. I cannot believe they are putting Bries emotionless hero into End game.",0

965,"Very standart and simplify structure of the plot. Director’s and operator’s work means nothing, cause all that we seeng it just triviality. Actor’s works so pathetic and unremarkableness, sut like in worst tv shows. The wost Marvel film ever, in my small opinion.",0

970,extreamly boring through its entire running time. no plot or good villians. bad acting. how did brie larson won an oscar is beyond me.,0
971,"As a die-hard MCU fan I was very hyped for this movie and I was especially interested in how they would interpret such an important character on the big screen. Sadly, Captain Marvel was a huge, HUGE disappointment and pales in comparison to even the worst previous installations of the MCU films.The glaringly obvious issue throughout the entire movie is that the lead actress woefully lacks any emotional response to the world around her and as a result her character is 2 dimensional and bland at best. I think Larson was great in ""Room"" but for some reason she failed miserably in this role, perhaps she's not ""superhero material"". The villain was also exceptionally boring, and very under powered. Any Marvel fan knows that the villain would not pose any threat to one of the strongest beings in the MCU, which highlights the weak script and disappointing story.The musical score has always been integral to superhero movies and is often what makes me connect with the movie more than anything. Hans Zimmers work in Snyders Man of Steel and Nolans Batman Trilogy stands out as prime examples of musical perfection in superhero movies. Sadly, the film score in Captain Marvel is forgettable and underwhelming, and I find myself struggling to remember even the title soundtrack just 2 hours after watching the movie.I would be dismiss if I didn't mention that the script has a certain unpopular ideology written all over it and after leaving the cinema I was left with the impression that this movie was not made by people who understand and love Marvel, but by someone who is pushing an agenda. I hesitate to drag gender politics into my review, but it had to be mentioned as it's so prevalent in the film and we've all seen the concerning comments made by the main cast and crew. That's enough about that.As to be expected the CGI is great, which is one of the few redeeming qualities of this film, but does not even come close to making up for the previously mentioned sins.In summary:The story is weak and the casting failed miserably. The soundtrack was forgettable and the lazily injected gender-politics fell flat on it's face.2/10.",0
972,The salute to Stan Lee gets this dumpster fire one star. I'm looking forward to seeing a remake of this staring a store mannequin as Brie Larson. Not one to watch or to buy later. Skip this one.,0

974,the character sucked.she didn't feel like was human. no emotions at all. I hope they change the character for endgame,0
975,Leftist feminist politics spoil this film.  The main actress basically tanked this film with her anti white anti male rhetoric.  This film could have been good if they kept the politics out of it and they followed Wonder Woman's lead.  I would not recommend this movie and hope the character is killed off soon.  I don't want to watch numerous films with Bree Larson.,0
976,I went into this movie the same way I went into the previously overly-politicized movies; Black Panther and Wonder Woman.  I ended up liking BP and WW.  Last night i kept checking my watch so I could calculate when it would be over so I could go home.,0
977,"The words ""cash grab"" come to mind. A forgettable paint-by-the-numbers superhero movie that isn't helped by Brie Larson's cardboard performance. Easily one of the worst MCU films, if not the worst. My only guess is that they made this movie to explain Captain Marvel's presence in Avengers: Endgame. And that's exactly how it comes off -- just going through the motions to justify her presence in Endgame. In my opinion, they should have made a Black Widow movie.",0
978,awful movie. please dont watch this PR disaster for marvel you are not missing anything.,0
979,"Captain Marvel is a pure sjw propaganda movie. If you suffer from sleep deprivation this is the movie for you because its so boring it will help you fall asleep. Otherwise dont waste your money or time with this abomination, that dares to call itself a movie.",0
980,A good movie if you think of it as a cat movie or a direct to tape Buffy: The Vampire Slayer Goes Super Saiyan kind of thing.,0
981,"Oh boy were do I start... First of all if this Captain Marvel bit*h defeats thanos in the End Game then I am done with marvel. If you Love Marvel then just pretend this movie doesn't exists. Brie Larson is Racist, Sexist, Ignorant & narcissist. She hates white males. I would rather have a good movie than SJW Bull-Sh*t, I mean why ruin a movie for SJW. This movie was less like Captain Marvel and more like Captain MEH-WELL. This movie has kinda bad script/story telling. If we compare her with wonder woman on scale of 1 to 10 then Wonder woman is 10 and captain marvel is 3, with respect to her acting, looks and story. Instead of Brie Larson they should have casted someone else for this character like Charlize Theron or Kate Beckinsale or Anne Hathaway or any hot actress, Just by casting hot actress alone would have made this movie great, Brie Larson has got no curves, she looks like piece of sh!t without expressions. I am not saying it's worst movie ever made in Hollywood but it's worst MCU movie, although this movie has its own moments. She didn't earned her powers, she got it for free. Also Brie Larson is Men hater, and her personal views aside she did really bad acting in the movie. And as Kevin Feige said she is the most powerful superhero in MCU.. Trust me this movie has no evidence to support that argument. I see Thor, Doctor Strange & Scarlett Witch easily defeat her. As all of them seem more powerful than her. Doctor Strange will teleport her somewhere far. And Thor will teleport himself if needed but I think he can fight her because he could easily withstand force of entire star in infinity war and he could take the attack of all 6 infinity stones and still nothing happened to him. And Scarlett Witch can easily fight with her neck to neck without falling apart. Lastly I would say Dear Marvel, What in the name of SJW have you done. We must sign petition for recasting. We need hotter actress instead of this Expression-less Brie Larson, So if we get bored with the movie then we can at least watch the actress. 1st 10 years were great under Captain America, Next 10 years with lead role of Captain Marvel... Not a fu*king chance... At least give us hotter actress. Its Funny How Marvel can fire James Gunn and keep Brie Larson. Captain Marvel is as powerful as Thanos. Thanos killed half of all life, Brie Larson killed half of Marvels profits.",0
982,"This film wasn't just bad, it was politically motivated. No place for that in an action film.",0
983,"Not really sure how people have managed to like it so much, being a die-hard fan, I felt that this was probably the worst Marvel film that I have ever seen. Spoiler Alert.- The storyline is a bit too predictable, like a Hindi movie. - Captain Marvel just happens to crash on Earth, despite being Eons away.- Nick Fury trying to act cute and unnaturally sweet to a cat is almost revolting to watch.- No background on the supreme intelligence.. or the Pegasus project- At one point, captain marvel decides to change her uniform colour and offers the opportunity to a kid. The kid somehow knows how to operate this tech. The colour that she chooses doesn't seem much like what the girl is wearing at all.- How did a Kree scientist get her hands on the Tess in the first place?-And when she did, her motive was to make a light-speed achieving ship for the Skrull? No better ideas? Really?- Maria's daughter's reaction on seeing Vers is incredibly stupid and mellow.-A majority of her dialogues and actions are irrelevant.- An alien cat just happens to be around when all hell is breaking loose at a covert aircraft base.- Just spits out the Tess in the end credit scene on Fury's desk, wow, what an original storyline.- Nick Fury looses an eye while trying to pet a cat.. utter crap..- Ver's friend Maria can (after a bit of tweaking) fly into the space, avoid advanced fighters and survive.- The mighty Ronan throws a few missiles at the planet but Captain Marvel flips one of them and blows everything (I guess he didn't need the Tess so badly after all).- Ronan decides to F-off pretty fast- Jude Law is sent back to his planet so that they can keep hunting the Skrulls (easier way would have been to destroy Kree, but no, how will they make more movies out of it?)- Captain Marvel got her powers from an engine core blast and the Kree kept her alive to find the core? :OThis movie felt like a by-product and a money spinner than an actual story-line based movie. All in all, it was a Marvel-ous let down",0
984,"This is a terrible movie. The main character would have been better played by a wooden plank. Probably the first miss casted character in the MCU. Regarding the rest of the movie, I would say the direction is bad, but the script is in my opinion terrible. The lack of character development and overall a good structure for this movie, made me regret having lost 2 hours of my life... Avoid at all cost. It bring nothing new to the MCU table. Hopefully they kill off the character and reboot it with the Monica Rambeau version",0
985,"SJW propaganda movie supported by Bilderberg is real and this movie is bad as hell. Brie Larson is acting like a brick with no emotion. Not even CGI could cover it up. She was bad casting! Some parts of the film are OK, like 5 out of 10, but overall it is not worthy your money, not even at Netflix. I like women heroes like Ripley played by fantastic Sigurney Weaver, not Brie Larson as Carol Denver. She is weak and overpowered. Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury is very good, but overall directors Anna Boden & ryan Fleck with writters made a weak film. Forgettable.",0
986,worst than the amazing spider-man 2 and the sjw crap made even worst. if you want to watch a good movie with a amazing female character go watch alita: battle angel.,0
987,This is not what I expected it to be... totally a disaster. The direction and action both were missing. Even the cast were not performing up to the mark...such a powerful character has been highlighted as some cheap super hero.. never expected this from Marvel studios... :( Disappointed,0

990,An uninteresting movie with an emotionless main character.Couldn't have been more boring.,0
991,She's so wooden that you think she may be used to invade Troy at some point. Captain Marvel lives down to your lowest expectations. The best time to watch this movie would be after you've died... the worst entry in the MCU by far.,0
992,"Terrible movie, ripe with political messages, character was unknown except for the moment that Rogue drained her dry! Her character wasn't important AND captain marvel is NOT who defeats Thanos in the comics Thanos was defeated by Adam Warlock who called the glove to himself because he controls the soulstone directly! Read your own comics Marvel! Make sure your staff reads them particularly your directors!",0
993,"Brie Larson's shameless politicization of this film should be unacceptable regardless of one's race, gender, or beliefs. Entertainment does not have to be mindless but neither should it actively seek to disenfranchise people. Get woke, go broke",0
994,White Men hating and preaching just like one would expect feminazi propaganda to be. Apart from that the movie isn't even any good. Brie Larson can't act at all she looks so bored all the time like she doesn't even want to be there. Even S.L Jackson was doing some bad fighting performances allthough he should know how to perform better. maybe that's all because of the bad writier / directorThe best part was indeed the cat it was the only performer who didn't bore the audience,0
995,"Borderline Boring movie, there is some action, but the hero literally has 0 weaknesses. The main problem with the movie is the actress they chose to represent Captain marvel. She is so expressionless, and bland, Her face is almost always BLANK, you feel like she is reading off a script. The main focus of this movie is Nick Fury, Samuel L jackson, who ofcourse, is a much better actor than the main hero. Sadly the movie focuses too much on her, and this leads me to give a bad score. If this was a Nick Fury movie it would be a 6. But since it is Captain Marvel, and Captain Marvel is Bland and Mediocre. Totally out of element for the MCU. Brie Larson does not belong in the MCU, the skills of Other actors will outshine her in Endgame, i hope they kill off captain marvel in the start of Avengers Endgame. I have decided to give this movie a 0 for the aforementioned reasons... You were better than this marvel.",0
996,"Woefully miscast protagonist makes a generic entry into the Marvel films even more so.  Samuel L Jackson phones in his performance and looks weird due to CGI.  The cat is funny, the aliens are confusing and boring, not sure what some of the ""professional"" reviewers are raving about.  I'd just wait for it to come out on Netflix.",0
997,Brie Larson was the wrong person to play Captain Marvel and the character feels like it’s being shoehorned into the MCU where it is doing more harm to the franchise than good.,0
998,"In my opinion, Thor: Dark World used to be the worst movie in the MCU until Captain Marvel.  I had such high hopes for this movie.  I think Brie Larson is a fine actress, but a horrible miscast for Captain Marvel.  Besides the 90's nostalgia, and Goose, the cat, the movie was an absolute snorefest.  I was looking forward to Endgame (and still am), but I'd be lying if I said this movie hasn't made me a little unsettled on what the MCU has in store for us in the future.",0
999,"The movie had an emotionless protagonist, disjointed plot, and insignificant fight/battle scenes.  I wanted to like CM but she showed no emotion at the end so it's difficult to relate to the protagonist.",0
1000,"Thouroughly unremarkable and forgettable in every way; script, plot, acting and characters. Normally it would be a four or five on a ten scale, but with all the political posturing that the movies stars (mostly Larson, but also Jackson who seems to get a free pass for his moronic statements for some reason) insist on vocalizing I’m inclined to downgrade my rating to ZERO. Larson has been packaged as the savior of everyone figuratively and of woman kind literally. Problem is she and marvel forgot super hero’s aren’t real and that Larson is just another spoiled obnoxious actress (yes I said actress).When will Disney/Hollywood figure out that hiring activist actors hurts the bottom line of the projects they are in. Hey Disney, if you insist on hiring these activists at least put a muzzle on them. We don’t want to hear their political commentary. Their job is to entertain. Kind of like a jester. Now chop chop start entertaining...",0
1001,"Retconned a bunch of stuff, Brie is a foot and the movie is boring. I cant believe they did this to MCU",0
1002,"Story was garbage. I threw up twice during the movie. Had nothing to do with the film but thought it was worth noting. Go back and watch Wonder Woman again, Alien, T2, anything else with a strong female lead if that's what you're looking for. Acting is not really worth watching in this movie. I could write something better than this with my dog, Tito. He at least has emotion. I would rather puke again rather than watch this again.",0
1003,"Were there some things to like? Yes. But I'm truly annoyed at the not-so-subtle SJW symbolism. Captain Marvel's power is suppressed by the ""patriarchy"". It's only when she rips free of it that she can use her full powers. The Skrulls are used to make a statement about immigration. Sorry, I don't go to a movie to get SJW messages shoved in my face. It ruins the MCU. I fear that this will taint Avengers Endgame.  If it does, I'm done with the MCU, which would be a terrible shame, since I've been a fan of Marvel ever since I was a child. Take your SJW elsewhere, Kevin Feige and Brie Larson.  You're not welcome here.",0
1004,"Since RottenT has stooped to using bots to boost reviews (see the story about it on ZeroHedge), I decided to come here and post my review...... since it wasn't accepted on Rotten. Mediocre writing and amazingly poor acting by Larson. Why oh why did they pick her to play the lead? The CGI was .... meh..... but her acting ability is dreadful. Save your money, wait for Endgame!",0
1005,"Great CGI, could get use to Samuel L Jackson's face after a while. That said, everything else was terrible, boring script, dull acting, little character development for Capt Marvel...just text book definition of a Mary Sue. I mean, Capt Marvel has always been unpopular in the comics, and Brie Larson's arrogance appearance with little weaknesses didn't make it any better. Comparing to Wonder Woman, WW was powerful, but she also retained her ignorance with the society, and slowly learnt of her powers and developed as a likable character. Whereas, Capt Marvel....warrior hero straight off the bat. Where were you thinking Disney Marvel?!?",0
1006,"Lets get a few things upfront.  I generally love Marvel Movies.  I generally love movies with strong female leads.  Despite this, I found myself loathing this movie, possibly because I saw it with such high expectations and with such high stakes being the movie that will be crucial to End Game, a movie I have been looking forward to for years.  Brie Larson is generally un-charismatic and un-likeable.  At no point does her character establish any empathy with the audience.  The plot itself likely doesnt help.  The amnesia angle is played poorly and we never really feel like we know or understand the character.  Her singular motivation point, the equality angle, is so poorly force fed to audiences we cant possibly be sympathetic or understanding of the character.  The main character undergoes little in terms of character development short of removing an inhibiting chip from her neck.  The end battle has no tension.  Her powers are completely over the top and seem unearned and without challenge.   Even her friend is not very likeable as she chooses to engage in a few outer space thrills than protect her 6 year old daughter from rampaging aliens.  Direction and editing is very poor.  The jokes are lame and depending on your perspective a main and beloved character, Fury, is reduced somewhat by the knowledge that his damaged eye was in fact damaged by a cat (albeit an alien).  Barely amusing - unless you go back the past movies, whereby the character becomes ridiculous every time he takes about his eye.  All in all the pacing, script and narrative is a mess. Direction is variable, editing is a mess particularly in the last few battles.  There is little to like this movie for.  Finally and most depressingly.  Captain Marvel seems to have little love for earth and barely any backstory with Thanos.  Now this character is supposed to sway the balance in End Game.  How will this reflect on our beloved characters who have fought for years and lost much against Thanos.  Its hard to care and easy to be worried for the future of MCU given the emphasis they seem to want to place on this ill conceived character.",0
1007,"Boooring. The lead actor, Brie Larson is a terrible, uncharismatic super-hero. This is actually the first female superhero, from Marvel that I would prefer to never see again.",0
1008,"This film reminded me a lot of ""Alita: Battle Angel""; so much potential to be amazing, yet ultimately falls flat on its face due to a horrible script and a bland Mary Sue protagonist. From a non-political standpoint, the film fails completely to create a world worth emotionally investing in. The lead actress has already been proven to have amazing talent as seen in ""Room"", yet in this movie she has the acting abilities of Kristen Stewart from ""Twilight"" and Milla Jovovich from the early ""Resident Evil"" movies.Rather than this, the protagonist has virtually no flaws and is deemed a literal ""god"" by everyone for being perfect and all-powerful in every way imaginable. There is no struggle or conflict in this movie; just a poorly edited montage of explosions and deaths until the predicted end goal is achieved by the protagonist.But the main crime of this movie is it's absolute failure to push it's third-wave feminist agenda.It is clear that the focus on this movie was to push the third-wave feminist agenda to the extremes; that women all have the potential to be just as good, or even better, than men. However, to try and prove that point in a fictional movie only backfires on itself. That's because there's plenty of real-life examples of amazing woman that such supporters of this movement can be praised for, and because the film reasserts that the accomplishments of men are the golden standard that everyone else, including women, needs to try desperately to live up to or succeed.Why do we have to have such messages forced and pushed in fictional worlds in order to be recognized or deemed ""true""? Why can't women be amazing for doing their own things or for being themselves instead of only recognizing women that meet or succeed the benchmarks left by men? We each have our own strengths and weaknesses that compliment one another when we work together. Women and men are not inherently equal in virtue, but they are in value and for the things they are able to accomplish on their own that men will never be able to do. In conclusion, this film isn't even worth waiting until it's on Netflix to watch. There's nothing of entertainment or moral value in this movie that makes it truly worth remembering or recognizing.",0
1009,First time I watched a Trailer about this movie I though it will be a bad movie. After the cinema I changed my opinion to  even worse. This movie is made by people who never understood any marvel movies. This movie ruins Stan Lee legacy. I think these people who made this movie hated Stan Lee. I am really disappointed in Disney. But Disney never change. Before they made awesome csrtoons but now 0 work = bad movies.,0
1010,"It's stunning to me that Feige would throw the entire MCU in the trash with retcons and plotholes to shoehorn this character into Endgame?!? this movie is largely carried by Sam Jackson.  The middle of the movie will absolutely put you to sleep, and the ending has extremely bad CGI.  Brie Larson is clearly miscast and the weakest part of the film.  And Captain Marvel is so powerful, I'm not sure what villain Marvel can come up with to pose a challenge. She'll be able to defeat Thanos easily in Endgame (so I guess the past 11 years of buildup is totally wasted.)  I feel the worst for the orignal Avengers, who are now not really needed at all anymore with Captain MarySue now introduced to the MCU.",0

They have a lot of work to do to make Captain Marvel a likeable character in the future and I'm not sure it's worth it seeing as how many other rich options they have to play with.I usually go see these movies 5 or more times in the cinema but once was more than enough for this fan.",0
1020,"Not a terrible movie- had some good laughs, and Samuel L. Jackson as Fury is, as always, a delight- but by God, Captain Marvel the character was BLAND. I've heard some people attribute this to the memory-wiping/brainwashing she endured, but come ON. At no point in the movie was she anything but a Strong Female Character(TM) that made a few smart quips and kicked butt.Like, let me highlight a little bit of this for you with a **SPOILER**: There's this part where she apologizes to the Skrulls for participating in the Kree's (more or less) genocide of their race. Talos says it's cool, war means everyone's hands are dirty, no harm done. I'd argue that her fighting for the Kree is the most controversial thing about her in this movie (the rest is, as I said, bland beyond words).But this apology is undermined by two things:A) Captain Marvel is also a victim of the Kree. She has been manipulated into helping them in this fight. They took advantage of (or deliberately wiped) her memory/lack thereof, and so the average viewer could dismiss it as ""It's not REALLY her fault, she was brainwashed.""B) We never actually SEE her participating in any of this slaughter. We see her participating in a recovery mission that ends with them being ambushed by the Kree (i.e. blatantly painting them, to us and Danvers, as the enemy). We never see her actually doing anything morally questionable towards them- if Marvel/Disney wanted to paint a picture of a deeper character, a solider who has committed wrongs (intentionally or not) and needing to atone for them, it would have made for a much better character.But silly me: Then she wouldn't be a ROLE MODEL for little girls, and God knows that's all female characters need to be. Strong enough that she can flatten her enemies without a real fight (she BARELY even got knocked around in that big fight towards the end), never makes any significant mistakes, and is easily trusted/accepted/forgiven by all the right people.We have a word for that. It's a ""Mary Sue"", and despite what Certain People whine about that term, IT IS NOT A COMPLIMENT.Bad show, Marvel/Disney. You could've made Captain Marvel a beautifully developed personality like Iron Man, Thor, Wonder Woman, etc. Instead you chose to play it safe so you could sell toys and brag about how you made a female superhero film and how ~feminist~ you are.",0
1021,"I wanted to do my best to stay away from the political controversy and give this movie a chance. No matter how hard a tried to keep it out of my mind, the entire movie felt like it was being forced down my throat. The pacing was bad, cg was bad, acting was bad, the ""origin"" elements of some of the events were chosen poorly. I really hope they dont make Bri Larson the ""face"" of marvel. Her acting was flat line and she is not convincing as the ""most powerful"" super hero in the MCU. Overall a huge disappointment when I wanted it to be great.",0

I gave 3 out of 10 for the cat and Sam Jackson for trying to save this mediocre desaster of a movie.",0
1025,"The film was mostly boring with a few moments of mediocre, de jure Marvel action sequences. Most of the characters were one-dimensional, dry, and just plain boring. It's not the worst MCU film, but it's definitely not the best.

1027,"Captain Marvel was a movie that had a ton of potential, but lost out due to a shortsighted script compared to what could have been. Let me explain.Carol Danvers is a character that has been around since 1977. I have accepted that super hero movies have creative license. However, this is character that has various levels of impact in her long career. In the beginning she had involvement with Captain Mar-vel and became Ms. Marvel. This character would later lose her powers to Rouge (of the X-Men) and then evolve in the powerhouse Binary. This arc alone would have been amazing as a way to bring her in and would be a good arc to bring in the X-Men and potentially the Fantastic Four. This voyage could have been an amazing story of loss and evolution that would have climaxed into Captain Marvel. This would be something that with a shrewd writer could be something that could ellipse the source material and give depth to a character.Instead of this possible option they crammed the Kree-Skrull war into one movie that was meant to be an origin movie for Carol Danvers and in many respects Nick Fury. In the end, this movie has stellar special effects, great acting in presenting Nick Fury and Talos, and the cat was a hoot. Aside from that Captain Marvel was presented by the actress and writers in a fashion that was more 2 dimensional and lacking. To me this was a quick gain in something that should have been postponed until the FOX merger was completed and make it into a longer arc that could have made Carol Danvers as a more multi-faceted character that could have been the foundation to drawing in some epic franchises into the MCU.",0
1028,Brie Larson is relatable as a rock the CGI is good but this would be a 1 without Samuel L. Jackson.,0
1033,"While it could have been a decent film, and brought a new character to the MCU, this film was lackluster at best. The trope of ""Amnesia"", which has been played to death in many films, feels like bad writing. The CGI was no where near upto normal MCU standards (but in all honesty theyve been slipping the last few films), the fight scenes were formulaic and ""been there, done that""...Honestly wait for Redbox....",0
1034,poor scenario also i didnt like Larson's performance she was emotionless i prefer her more us the  villain than a superhero  she could be next Thanos!If she go with the avengers team i will  not see this movie.,0
1035,"I was expecting a good movie, based on some critic reviews. But the character is not relatable and one doesn't care about whether she fails or succeeds. Brie Larson has, for the most part, resorted to the acting choice of ""trying to look cool by not showing emotion"". She has the little presence. She was amazing in 'Room', but wrong for this role. Ultimately, the movie didn't excite me, and the directors of the intriguing 'Half Nelson', have really let themselves down with this one.",0
1036,"This movie was boring. I couldn't focus on the dialogues between Nick Fury and Captain Marvel.  Even the from the trailer, "" I'm gonna end it."" that sounds very flat, which was no emotion to it, just read as it was written.",0
1038,"Other than the special-effects and costumes, this movie was terrible. The only good actor in the movie was Jude Law. Brie Larson is terrible as  Captain Marvel. Her acting is horrible and she has no charisma.  She came off like an irritated feminist the entire time. They were so many “men are dumb” jokes in the movie that it became annoying. The only reason Samuel L. Jackson was in the film was to be the comic relief. The way he loses his eye is stupid as well. It’s sad that the nobody-of-a-character is pegged to be the most powerful superhero in the Marvel universe  and we will undoubtably be seeing more of her in the future. Phase 3 of Marvel’s movie franchise looks like it’s going to be a real dud.   First Lucasfilm allowed Disney to ruin The Last Jedi with its social justice warrior politics. Now Marvel is going to let Disney do it to them too with Captain Marvel.",0
1039,"It's flat, mediocre and boring for most of the movie until the latter half. Larson is carried by better performances by better actors and actresses throughout the movie. She is emotionless for most of the movie and basically phones in the performance. What bother's me more then the acting is the absolute disrespect to the source material and the MCU as a whole. It's enough of an action flick that the kids will love it, but for an adult who was a fan of comics from marvel in their youth, they will feel insulted by this sham of a movie. Disney has trouble on their hands if this is the path they are taking the MCU down because they will lose most of their fan base in the process. My only prayer is that they do not do the same stunts that they did in this movie, in upcoming Avengers: Endgame.",0
1040,brie gives a decent performance still a bit stiff movies bland it feels forced filler than making a superhero that works,0
1041,"the plot is just boring, the action isn't good and the politics is absolute trash. just keep it out, it's absolutely cringeworthy. This one is a career-killer for brie larson.",0
1042,"Horrible movie - looks like a Marvel parody than a movie. It promotes lots of policies - without respecting viewer beliefs... It's absurd, horrible-ugly Captain Marvel's anatomy. It's really nasty. If Captain Marvel movie would have smell - would smell like a trash truck.",0
1043,"Very boring, and very weak film for marvel. I don't know what's worse than a movie or an actress... It's a complete failure for marvel.(",0
1044,"I went into this movie with an open mind, only to be presented a bland story with very little to no character development. The main character had absolutely no emotion, no real character development. force feed comedic moments that occur at all the wrong times.",0
1045,"Весь фильм тащили фьюри гусь джуд лоу и конечно же кот, в целом фильм проходной никчёмная игра бри ларсон раздражала, но смазывалась ребячливостью фьюри , ожидал конечно большего кто то говорил о путешествие во времени о сильнейшем мстителе, а на деле летает и стреляет энергией, ах да ещё эти первые минут 20 фильма просто рукалицо",0
1046,I prefer humble super heros and the backstory was predictable. The movie falls flat in many ways. Casting choice was wrong for this movie. Not looking forward to more smug scenes from Brie Larson. All powerful hero with no threats or weaknesses so what is the point....the end.,0
1047,"I could've given it a 5. But what a waste of good MCU hero. The script and storyline was mediocre. My god, even for an origin story. How could they mess it so bad. It could've been a decent movie if it focused more on the story instead on the whacked ideology that the movie was trying to shove down the viewers thoughts. I hope they do the MCU fans a solid and just kill off this version of captain marvel and have a do over with emily blunt.",0
1048,"This movie is the worst movie in all of Marvel, Disney and cinematic history. It's just a propaganda film funded by the DOD. They need to get you to enlist in preparation for WWW3. Please do yourself a favor and boycott this film.",0
1049,"Some CGI was okay. Guess how Nick Fury looses an eye, it's about as dumb as how solo got his name.  Do not spend money on this cinematic experience.  You would be more entertained if you took a twenty out of your wallet and set it on fire.",0
1050,"Movie is pretty meh. Not the worst, but FAR from the best. Also relies too much on 90's nostalgia. Sam Jackson carries this movie mostly. Sucks they just made Monica Rambeau a child when she was Captain Marvel way before Carol Danvers. Oh well. Bring on Endgame.",0
1051,"A bland movie that could have been at least passable, if not for the overt ""subliminal"" messages about Carol Danvers learning how all the men in her life are controlling her.  This actress DOES NOT deserve to take over for Captain America, she deserves to be replaced by a good actress and a writer that cares about the character they are writing, not the identity politics their echo chamber wants to push.",0
1052,"When Gal Gadot stepped on screen as Wonder Woman, it felt like a step forward having a female being the star super hero . The Wonder Woman movie had heart, comedy, action, and the dialogue felt natural.  Audience members could feel themselves caring about the storyline and characters. This movie , Captain Marvel,  seems like a step back.  The dialogue feels forced, the plot can get confusing (trying to steal a page from the Matrix playbook where the characters question what is real)..and I personally didn't care much for the laser gun action sequences.  It is expected that in a super hero movie, there will be some cartoonish type action, but I feel like Disney has damaged the  super hero genre ..just like many people feel that Disney dropped the ball with a certain recent Star Wars theme movie. This feels more like a film that could have gone straight to dvd instead of a film that has earned $1 billion . Hopefully, this is not an indication of the type of movie we will see with Avengers Endgame.",0
1053,God no don’t do this to endgame I did not like this movie at all Brie Larson is the worst.,0
1055,"Brie Larson is the new Keira Knightley. This movie was incredibly average, with a great story and alien race ruined by terrible, terrible acting by Brie.",0
1057,"While there are segments in the film that entertain, ""Captain Marvel"" suffers from a messy plot and side-plots, uninspiring action sequences, and bland acting.",0
1059,"Movie and Brie were bland and I came out of it mostly bored, This was a movie made to make money first and the fans of the comics weren't even considered... I'd rather watch Thor The Dark World again...",0
1061,"Just like in comics, they are forcing an uninteresting character into the universe. it has it's moment with a few jokes here and there, but not enough to save the movie. at this point I'm really worried for how she is going to take part in Endgame... hope russos can fix this emotionless character.btw this movie causes some continuity issue for the mcu.",0
1062,A character transformed to be the same boring feminist in real life.  Movie used for ideological purposes of a group of collective hysteria that only wants to put an end to chivalry.,0
1063,If there would not be a S.L. Jackson role this movie could be about anything.Weak jokes... battlefight between Granny and Kpt. Marvel? Srsly? There are kids watching this movie... I know that you need fresh ideas but leave old people alone.Actors play also very weak... Brie Larson work with your play instead fight with the world (white people) / or focus on the second one - right now it is not working.,0
1064,"The real shame of Captain Marvel is it's complete mediocrity; the most cookie-cutter superhero movie I've seen to date. It's just not a memorable experience in any shape or form, bar some mildly interesting scenes with Samuel L Jackson.",0
1067,Very poor of storytelling and uninteresting. Captain Marvel is one of the worst Marvel film and most overrated character. I only watched it for Endgame.,0
1074,"Marvel is an SJW pacted movie that no one wants to see.  It has more plot hole than any movie i have seen in a long time.  The main plot is to protect a Kree scientist Marvel and her new faster than light engine from the Skrulls. Now in order to get to earth both races would already have Faster than light engines.   The kree scientist Marvel needs to join the US military to use there tech to make the engine even though this kree scientist has a lab on a cloaked satelite orbiting earth.  And how does the kree scientist join the us military with BLUE BLOOD. The ulimate SJW moment is when the Skrulls are Refuges separated from their families witch is clearly a comment on imigration reform.  Writers and director need to read more about the Marvel Universe and what has happened before.  I will not pay to see an entertainment movie that tells me what I should think about politics in america. the only reason that the movie did so well the first weekend was that, a. the fans where looking for Avengers Endgame links and b. Disney used the media to inflat ticket sales.",0
1075,"Some questionable retcons, a paper thin plot and a flat performance from the main character result in a straight-up bad MCU film, the only MCU film I actively did not enjoy and could not get absorbed in. Even for Thor Dark World or Hulk, I still found myself absorbed and enjoying the ride. Maybe Captain Marvel wasn't made for me, but I think films should be for everyone. I don't see any sort of groundbreaking benefit to the world to showing sexist caricatures of male bullies being proven wrong (""you know why they call it a cockpit right?"") by a totally unrelatable and unlikeable main character. It doesn't matter if the main character is male or female, I just want them to have some qualities that I can identify with or at least appreciate",0
1077,"wow, I was really taken aback on how disappointing this movie was. Never has the MCU made a character so flat and uninteresting.. If your a fan of MCU like me and see them all then you have to watch it otherwise stay away.",0
1078,"So disappointed in this movie. Brie Larsen was the worst MCU Marvel character to date. They need to recast or kill off this character. I even watched this movie twice to make sure on how I felt. No heart or soul in this movie, and Brie comes across as very entitled and there is no real payoff here. As a longtime Marvel fan, this movie has put a bad taste in my mouth.",0
1079,"Disappointing.  I'm a big super hero fan and I thought the film would be at least watchable.  It seemed like the main actress didn't have the range to play this character.  To me, she came across as a small kid trying act serious.  A better actress would have made a better movie.  The changes to classic Marvel lore were also disappointing and took away from the movie.  I wanted to like this movie.  I can almost say it was ok but I'm leaning toward bad.",0
1080,"I'm not sure how well this follows the comic, but it says something that the Cthulhu cat steals the show...  Lots of fight scenes, but the main character seems lacklustre throughout.",0
1082,"Just to be clear, I'm not reviewing this film as a 0 because I hate women. I am giving it a 0 because it sucks. An uninspired origin story that we have seen time and time again. The laughably weak villain, 90's nostalgia wears thin within minutes of Captain Marvel landing on Earth again. And Larson's performance really is flat. She has zero charisma, She's stone-faced for most of the film so if you do see a glimmer of actual emotional from her, It's like seeing a Unicorn.Captain Marvel is easily one of the worst Marvel films that I have seen and there have been some stinkers (Ant-Man 2 for example). It's everything that you shouldn't do in a superhero film.",0
1089,"As a big MCU fan I was cringing watching this, it sucked hard. It is the worst MCU movie. (and some people are complaining about Age of Ultron xD) I like the actors, but the story was poor written. She is totaly overpowered. It is boring to watch (like superman). The MCU movies manage to connect me emotionally but this movie had no dramatic moments or good characters. They had to put in Fury and Coulson to get some attention. I hate that the movie gets to many credits like 1. Avengers name 2. First chronological appeareance of the Tesseract 3. The **** explanation of Furys eye. The goofy green dudes looked so funny like I was watching old Star Trek.",0
1091,"i got bored realy fast, nothing special about this movie and performance of Brie Larson",0
1092,Worst movie in the history of MCU by far. I will never see this movie again.,0
1095,Terrible. Across the board. I'm convinced the controversy was just a marketing plan to offset early screening disappointment. Nothing is good about this. Even the 90s nostalgia is pandering. Brie Larson is an enigma...in that it's a mystery as to who thinks shes talented enough to lead a film. I'm still scratching my head over her oscar win.,0
1096,Boring and flat movie that is tainted by the hateful political sentiments from Brie Larson.,0
1097,Brie Larson spoiled an already **** character.... what more can I say other than GIVE BACK FREAKIN MONEY YOU INSOLENT PIECE OF SH*T.,0
1098,Brie is so terrible at carol it makes me sad everyone has a right to be mad at this movie you can’t even relate to her character sad...,0
1102,"Standart Marvel movie junk with some feministic metastasis. Boring, stupid, empty. Why they changed the hero origins? No answer.What's the motivation of the hero? No answer.",0
1103,"This is a terrible movie. What went wrong, Marvel? The character is boring, the writing is awful and the actress is horrible.",0
1104,"-RESUMED CRITIC: Is a movie that you would watch once, maybe twice in the Tv if is nothing else to see. -LONGER CRITIC: This movie has all the cliches of Hollywood inside, not only on the plot but also in the dialogues making a movie of 2 hours super tedious the first hour and somehow a little bit interesting the second hour. You can easily begun to watch it after the first hour and you would understand everything and even get the fun part of the movie.Second point, I understand that for reason of the plot the actress cant show emotions but her performance is like some who that doesn't want to go to work or even work with bad attitude, obscuring all the nice things that you can take from the movie. And you have a S.L.Jackson being a pg13 S.L.Jackson but you loved because he is ACTUALLY doing a good job.",0

1107,"Bland, not fun, no ass, nick fury retcon made it a zero. Just another generic cookie cutter superhero movie pce",0
1108,"Mediocre movie at best. It is a typical Mary-Sue type superhero action movie, with a main character that is 1-dimensional, posses no clear motives, drives, ambitions, fear, allegiences, etc. Very disappointing, like expected from a movie like this.",0
1109,"Booring. Bad CGI, nonsense script full of plot holes and a character who is violent and stupid. This is by far the worst Marvel movie. And don't make me talk about skrulls.. The only thing good was the Stan Lee intro. Oh, and a really horrible score!!",0
1110,"Brie Larson was a terrible choice for Captain Marvel, action movies are just not in her range of ability and she is way out of her depth here. Samuel L Jackson can sell any movie so he does well here.",0
1111,"I actually love Captain Marvel (the character) and wanted to love this movie. But alas, I didn't. It's plot is disjointed, it's progress a snail's pace, and I think was the nail in the coffin for superhero movies for me. I'm done, Marvel. Disney has killed Star Wars & Marvel with their political overtures.",0

1113,"Garbage movie, Not funny, Boring, Get a new actor! I cant believe i wasted my money seeing this rubbish",0
1114,A serious low point of the MCU. I have severe dread for the MCU going forward.,0
1115,"The actress just acts like a jerk the whole time, and wasnt even in shape!  Do you know how hard most actors and actresses work out to at least look the part of a superhero role? She didn’t put in the work. I hope she’s not in anymore Marvel movies",0
1116,"The weakest Marvel movie ever. Poor script, bad actress. I hope Captain Marvel doesn’t ruin Endgame",0
1117,"Waste of time. Not happy with this installment of the MCU at all. Nothing good to say, and that's rare for me (last time I was this disappointed was Iron Man 3, or the new Star Trek or Star Wars films).SJW's ruin everything. Get woke go broke has struck again. I don' t understand what they were thinking when making this. Wooden character with no arch or growth. Total Mary Jane (perfect character with no flaws). Reminds me of Rey in Star Wars.MARVEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN STARBUCK FROM BSG (Katie Sackhoff)!!Save your money for Endgame (hopefully whats-her-face will be written out of that as much as possible).",0
1118,"Despite all the negativity surrounding the film I went in with an open mind, I'm a massive marvel fan and have loved most of their films but this is by far the most dull and uninteresting heap I've seen. I genuinely think marvel has reached its peak with infinity war and can't come back from this.",0
1119,"Went to watch this movie and have never been so disappointed, its pure garbage",0
1120,"Unimpressive addition to the MCU, riding in on a wave of controversy with the lead, a questionable decision by Marvel to make Captain Marvel the ""golden avenger"" of the MCU and the usual eye straining overuse of CGI.Brie Larson was about as charismatic as a cardboard box during the entirety of the flick I honestly questioned if I was in the right theater.To top it off, any criticism directed at this boring box that tries to entertain you with bright colors is boiled down to one ""trolling"" or simply ""hating"" this lackluster affair. You can thank Larson herself for that strawman tactic propagated by her fans.",0
1121,"Captain Marvel is without a doubt THE WORST Marvel movie to date.  Period.  Nothing about this woke-filled, SJW mess is likable.  It's not entertaining.  It's not exciting.  I have attempted to review this on Rotten Tomatoes and had my review removed, so now I've signed up with Metacritic because THEY ARE UNBIASED and not deleting reviews.  Do not go see this movie, period.",0
1122,The story line is cliche and and Brie Larson's acting is non-emotional; she looked like she didn't want to be in the movie. I wasn't going to watch this movie but FANDANGO would not allow me to get a refund for my pre-order despite allowing me for prior movies. By far the worst Marvel movie I've seen and I thought Thor 2 was bad.,0
1123,"They made a character with no real weakness who spends the entire movie as an expressionless hero with no charisma. I was so bored during this movie. By the time the pace FINALLY picked back up near the end, it was too little too late. This entirely forgettable entry into this massive film franchise is completely skippable. You won't need to see this to understand what's going on in Endgame. Yes, there will be this new Captain Marvel character in Endgame, but all you really need to know is that she existed back in the 90's and finds her way back to the action ""in the nick of time"" once Endgame rolls around. One thing to note: Your experience of the MCU as a whole may be lessened if you see this movie or accept this movie as canon. They literally retconned Captain Marvel as the BEGINNING of the Avengers, as well as the battle for control of a certain macguffin that was central to phase 1 marvel's climax. They also introduce a plotline where there's little reason for the Kree to have largely ignored Earth all this time since the 90's. This is a pretty big plothole.How does this rank compared to the rest of the MCU? It's right at the bottom; near but below Thor the Dark World and Iron Man 2. If Thor 2 and Iron Man 2 are both 2/5 stars, this one is 1.5/5 stars.",0
1124,"CGI is excellent as always, but the acting by Larson is simply unbearable. Poor casting choice on Marvel's part.",0
1125,Just go and watch pogo rather than this boring movie. Pathetic marvel film ever.,0
1126,First let me say I liked wonder woman and thought that  Gal Gadot  was great and my favorite actress is without a doubt Milla Jovovich I like her in Ultraviolet and all the Resident Evil: but captain marvel Brie Larson is wooden the movie is boring and really bad it doesn’t kelp when brie Larson alienates 75% of the audience maybe they should get  Milla Jovovich to replace Brie Larson and lets face Milla Jovovich can out act and everything else better then brie and I call B.S. on the numbers,0
1127,"Larson had one emotion the whole movie, so acting bad. All answers to fan's questions were stupid and non creative, totally disconnect from the MCU. Twist was interesting, yet the rest of the movie was dull and nothing happened. It just was not a fun movie.",0
1128,"My wife and I saw the film and be both have the same review. Movie was fine, it was just a movie, it was not bad, it was entertaining for sure but definitely not great. With that being said this film was for sure the worst Marvel film but only because MCU films are typically great or incredibly great and this movie was neither so by default it was the worst one. Best we can come up with is that Captain Marvel was like an episode of Agents of Shield with slightly better CGI.",0
1129,"It was trash. A complete boring overblown TV movie that wasn't up to par with what marvel usually does. Felt like a shield episode at best. To put it mildly, Fantastic four with Jessica Alba was better than this garbage....and that's not saying much. I guarantee the sequel to captain marvel will not make the money its making now because by then everyone will be well informed of this C list character.....lets hope to god that she is not the reason the avengers defeat Thanos...that would completely suck and make the 10 years invested in the MCU feel tainted....Had nothing to do with women in power.We were forced to watch a boring movie with no characterization. The movie was just a mess. Did the directors ever watch a Marvel movie in the MCU? They created many new plot holes, Nick fury's eye scratch , the tesseract fiasco, The fact Nick Fury had that stupid pager since 1995 and didn't call Captain Marvel when the sky opened up and ALIIENS with LOKI mind you, were attacking NEWYORK in Avengers ....yeah if that wasn't an emergency i don't know what is..ALIENS DUDE!! Something Captain Marvel is familiar with. He didn't call her when ULTRON, or the destroyer was on earth either. Listen, Wonder Woman, was a way better movie than this mess.",0
1130,"Garbage Actor, recast Captain Marvel and salvage the character. Brie Larson is the wrong person for the job and her crappy attitude and acting in general isn't wanted.",0
1131,Really wanted to like this being a fan of the rest of the MCU movies but this one just didn't live up to the hype.. boring and slow storyline. Very little character development. Some parts I was anxious for the movie to end already.  Acting was medicore and not believable.. some OK action but not nearly as well done as other Marvel movies. Felt like an after thought by the studio. Save your money and wait for it to come out on rental.,0
1132,Extremely generic. Poor acting by main actress and was happy for it to be over!,0
1133,"Wow, I almost fell asleep during the first hour.  Nothing intersted happened for at least the first half of the movie.  THe main character was a Mary Sue with no good development.",0
1134,"Terrible movie, terrible actress, terrible agenda. Don't even speak about this ""film"", and let it fade into the abyss of obscurity.",0
1135,It started off ok then it got a lot slow like doctor who a great idea thrown away. As for what they did to Nick fury.it's like the last 11 years of character building as  been for nothing,0
1136,This is just the beginning for the end of Marvel. This is worse than BvS. Whats sad is that the fans that IDIOT Brie Larson so gladly trashed are the reason she got cast. I remember when there were IG mockups of her as captain and we the fans made that happen. Trash movie was expecting better. Take your politics elsewhere it's not needed in our entertainment. I really don't get how they messed this up they're other powerful characters but with this one they just acted like they didn't know what to do or maybe it's just Brie doesn't know how to be a hero.,0
1137,"Marvel's worst movie ever, and the main character has emotions like a tree.",0
1138,"The trailers painted this as more political manifesto than a fun superhero movie, it made it look frankly dull compared to the rest of the MCU and made Brie Larson look a poor casting choice.I wish I could say the movie itself proved otherwise, but frankly it doesn't. The movie really is dull, and either Brie Larson does a great job portraying a character written to be as obnoxious as possible, or she was just the wrong person for the role.",0
1139,"As the last movie before endgame i had high expectations, after many reboots on the comics marvel had another shot at making this character relevant and lovable, they failed, brie larson aint fun, while tony stark who was a C tier marvel character became a top tier because of how fun his origin movie was captain marvel will remain unlikeable at best because of her origin movie doesnt move a needle towards making the carol denvers character any more likeable.",0
1140,emotions and fun factor in this movie is range from fan4stic and batvsup things they revealed are making the movie even worse for me,0
1142,"Lazy movie that does nothing to further the MCU, if this is a reflection of where Marvel is heading then the MCU is on its way to death.",0
1143,a very very bland movie with a blank actress. i want my refund. if you want to stay for the end credit pls dont. it makes no difference,0
1144,"had to sign up here to give my review as RT deleted my review and has lost all creditability I found the movie to be boring, captain marvel is a shallow character and was just lacking as a film, combine that with the pushed agenda laced in the film and I just didn't enjoy it at all imho the worst marvel movie to date.",0
1146,"Story was dragging. It never felt like I was watching an MCU movie. It was like a different thing. I was expecting to get my usual super hero experience but 1 and a half hour was all irrelevant conversations. It just didn't work for me.There is a plot twist and they could have done this better but no, it was just like... meh... A plot twist should be built up from the start and when it is revealed, it should be shocking, with it being foreshadowed the entire film. That way you can attract multiple viewings. But no... it is just meh...No super hero landing too... And for an origin story, we are expecting to learn together with the hero what he/she can do. But apparently she knows everything she is able to do right from the start.IMHO, Thor 2 and Iron Man 2 was better. At least thor 2 explored a new stuff by the converging of the 7 realms and it was action packed. And in Iron Man 2, that was the first time we saw a suit that is portable which is really cool. This one though has little to no action (Just 2 forgettable action scenes), no cool suit or display of power as she had everything right from the start except flight and binary form which was not showcased really well. It just came about without any build up.There is also no villian in the movie. In the first half it was Ben, and on the second half it was Jude whom did not really pose any threat; I mean he was down in just one shot. And then they teased Ronin which is really for nothing as we know what his future will be.This movie had so much potential but it felt really flat. I wanted to like it but I almost fell asleep between the 30 min mark til 1 hr and 30 min mark.Brie Larson's acting was fine at most parts even though some felt fake and she's always **** But my problem with her is that she is very replaceable; Brie is very replaceable as Captain Marvel unlike Hugh as Wolverine, Chris Evans as Capt America, Robert Downey as Tony, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and basically all of the MCU heroes.Overall I think this movie is bad. There were good things in it don't get me wrong, but it is very forgettable. I admit I liked some scenes and enjoyed that moment, but even now, I do not remember what those scenes are.",0
1147,A character to praise Disney's ideological agenda. Manipulating the Canon of the comics and the mcu itself to give it an importance that this character does not have. They did not learn anything from the disaster they have done in star wras.,0
1148,"Very bland movie. Expected so much more from the MCU. Didnt like how it retconed a lot of established facts. Also didnt care for the acting of the lead - seemed wooden and unemotional (which is funny because everyone kept telling her not to be so emotional?). I liked most of the songs featured but they seemed very forced in certain scenes and it was a bit jarring. CGI was fairly poor also. Story was very haphazard and convienent to move the film on when required. A load of plot holes that I dont have time to get into here. Was hoping for another butt kicking heroine like Wonder Woman but this left a lot to be desired. Finally, though I would consider myself a feminist I dont understand why they had to tear down men to build women up? That just seems to defeat the whole ""equality"" thing imho...",0
1149,"My first issue is I don't think that they cast the right person for Captain Marvel. I'm not going to say she was a bad actor because I've seen her play other roles better, I just don't think this is the right role for her. During the first portions of the movie, I was actually entertained and then throughout the rest of the movie, it's like she did not understand her character or who she was supposed to be playing. The music was very good I loved it. Of course Marvel soundtracks never get old but I don't agree with some of the songs they chose. I love Gwen Stefani but I would have totally chosen ‘hollaback girl’ as opposed to ‘I'm just a girl’. With the exception of the very beginning of the movie and the very end, I was very bored. The pacing seemed off.  There was a lot of dead space in-between people talking and the chemistry between some of the characters was just off. Some of the writing just made no sense and I think that this movie could have done better with a different writer and director.The driving force behind why Captain Marvel is the way she is seems very shallow. The whole narrative is that boys were mean to her and that was it. There was really nothing else that she had to overcome like other superheroes who had their families killed, or who had something traumatic happened to them. There was really no depth to her character and that was disappointing.It almost seems like one big commercial for female empowerment/oppression, and even as a female, I don't really appreciate that in a movie. Captain Marvel deserved to have more depth to her character than just a girl who was a victim. That's not cool For as much as they were hyping up this movie and marketing it to be something amazing, it fell below short.",0
1150,I was looking forward to seeing this movie since the trailers came out. There were a few good moments but overall this was a boring movie.  I've seen every movie in the MCU but I really feel I could have skipped this one. If you want to see the origin of Captain Marvel wait for it on a streaming service.,0
1151,"don't believe the POSITIVE REVIEWS for this movie. This movie is a complete bland mess. Brie Larson is the worst actor in the movie. The plot does not make sense. This is a feminist propaganda piece meant only for women. All the white men are evil, the black man is funny and the women can do no wrong. Brie Larson's face was never shown during fights. They shot the entire movie AROUND her because she was so terrible.They retconned many things in the MCU in order to make an average movie. This makes no sense.",0
1152,"I was pretty disappointed and bored with the film. Larson was a poor choice in terms of being a super hero. She seemed too soft and not to mention her lack of emotion in the film. It was tough to be engaged with CM because she lacked any growth in the film. Most of the CGI was whatever to me, nothing to write home about. I did not like how Fury actually loses his eye, it tarnishes his character and was a slap in the face. If you recall in Winter Solider, he said the last time he trusted someone, he lost an eye. Maybe it was the trust in whoever made this sad excuse of a film. Marvel made a poor choice in deciding to shoehorning a ""hero"" into finishing the fight against thanos. That itself is another slap in the face to fans. A finale involving the original avengers would have been poetic, hopefully it doesn't come to that.",0
1153,Most uninspired origin story I've seen in a long time. Casting choice for the protagonist was a mistake.,0
1154,There is absolutely nothing special about this movie. And it doesn't come close to even the worst MCU movie in terms of visuals. Only reason to watch it would be to be all caught up before watching EndGame.,0
1155,just a terrible movie in every way we walked out of the movies.  I have never done that before,0
1156,"Let's be real this movie sucks donkey balls, Re-cast captain marvel or kill her on END GAME cuz otherwise marvel just commited suicide. Best part is the cat and samuek l jackson. And that's it!",0
1157,"90's jokes/music felt shoved in, Larson/Marvel has the range of a block of wood, supporting cast is wasted, retconning the Kree/Skrull War sucks, the grrrl power stuff is just too on the nose and hamhanded. also do we really really need to be kept reminded of the immigration stuff? Its like an episode of angel with the demons hanging around the office and nobody is frickin weirded out or surprised. i really really hope Feige doesnt have Larson upstage evreyone in EndGame becoz it would feel unearned.",0
1158,"Brie Larson has the emotional range of Steven Seagal in this movie and the middle part of the film is, well, boring. They also gender swapped a major character (which is always a big no-no) and didn't have enough of Coulson or Ronan. Very disappointing movie all around.",0
1159,"no, this movie is not a definite 0. But all the factors considered it absolutely is.From the casting of Brie Larson and her appalling anti-(white)male rhetoric, the non canon story line, the OP status and future predicted role she might play in Endgame, the major vilification of the fan base from Marvel, Larson, Kevin, mainstream media, etc.. and the taking away of the public's voice on review sites such as RT.I'm so disappointed in the people who hold no stakes or interest in the Marvel franchise or its fans (especially of the comics and the MCU) who have invested so much in this brand, and what they are doing to this beloved world of superheroes.I'm simply disgusted in the whole process thus far.About the movie itself.. nobody really liked captain marvel in the first place, the comic has been repeatedly restarted the last few years.. and that makes it a strange choice in the first place.Movie captain marvel is ridiculously overpowered and self centered..There is a feminist undertone throughout the movie.I didn't like it at all, and when demanding people go see it and accusing people of trolling if they don't review it positively justifies my ultra low score.Anybody feel free to see it and enjoy it if you can but understand that for original comic (book) fans, the way things are shaping up lately (2 years?) is unacceptable.",0
1160,"I will not go deep into this movie since everything in it is a disaster. It's a pity that only Jackson and Bening can be ""partially"" saved from this chaos.",0
1164,"first half is really slow moving and pale and stale. secodn half gatheres a little bit of speed but there is a reason why captain marvel never gotten up to speed with the other superheros.. Real bad line: ""we are warriorheroes"".. noone can label himself as a hero.. thats the part of the people to label a warrior a hero.. -.-",0
1168,I think that they tried to politicize this movie too much. They made the movie's values too much about her being a woman and really playing up the girl power rather than promoting these values subtly. It almost felt like they had only one shot at a female lead movie and they wanted to make it count.,0
1170,"one of the worse marvel movie universe, brie larson just meh.. story line is boring.. the only good thing is the goose the cat so its definitely cat / 10. i like the relationship between goose and nick fury (except the part how nick lost his eye....)",0
1171,"I will throw in something that many reviewers, both 'professional' and non-professional have overlooked...Spoilers followCaptain Marvel has been in the Kree army for 6 years, right? It bothers me that the movie seems to imply (yet not explicitly state and make it part of the character's arc) that in all that time, she seems to have never made any connection to other Kree. In 6 years, she has no friends outside of the unit she is in - and even in terms of the unit, we never see them interacting socially? 6 years and she has no emotional attachments besides her trainer Yon-Rogg and the Supreme Intelligence? Does she go home and lie still until the next morning's training. It seems to me that this could have been an interesting thing to include - maybe she has friends (and dare I say it, even a romantic attachment) in the Kree army. And when she learns the truth about the Skrulls and Kree war, that this could provide some real conflict for her in emotional terms, dealing with the fact that she has friends that are now enemies.In reality, the writers couldn't be bothered with this as they just wanted to establish from the get go that a.) Marvel has powers b.) She has amnesia and has been separated from Earth.Let's talk about Earth and what bothers me there. It seems, from the flashbacks, that Marvel didn't have any real emotional connections on Earth either. I mean, interspersed in the ""You can't do it"" montage, could we not have some positive things as well. Things she might miss from Earth, friends, family, and yes (again I dare to say) even a romantic interest.Her only friend seems to be Maria Rambeau and her daughter Monica. What, Marvel lands back on Earth and starts to regain her memory and she has no recollection of her mother and father? Her family and friends? They never crop up in all her memories. Her visions from the Supreme Intelligence is an enigmatic scientist who she flew test flights with and then crashed with? Why do we never see even Maria in those visions? So, when we see her on Earth, it would be like 'Oh, yeah...'I could go on here, but you get my point - from my perspective, whether its with the Kree for more than half a decade or on Earth, it seems that the only things in Marvel's head are rage against the people who have put her down throughout her life. And this is never really addressed as a character arc.Heroes usually have families and friends and romantic interests. Why? It humanizes them, it makes us relate to them because we feel the same emotions.Of all the mistakes I think they made with this movie, this lack of emotional connection is the real blunder.If she had had even a romantic connection with Maria, it would have been great! What if Monica was her daughter too! We could have become invested. The lack of real emotional stakes is what let's the movie down.We are supposed to care about her connection with Maria, but we don't and it arrives too late in the movie for it to matter anyway.We care more for Talos - because he has a family and we can from that understand some parts of him.Marvel is an emotionless block because they rob her of this.It amazes me how such a large amount of professional movie reviewers think this movie is in anyway good or passable. They theoretically know what makes a good story and an interesting character, and yet...this movie, which is terribly written, has no real stakes at any point, has no character arcs, and has charisma-free character who has zero real personality traits...is given an average or good review by so many of these critics.It is so obvious they are only scared of either Disney or backlash from people online.This is a bad movie. Plain and simple.",0
1173,Boring. middle of the movie seems like it drags on for hours. and everything you can see coming. couldnt be more cliche,0
1174,I thought nothing could be more boring than Thor 2 but hell i was wrong… watching CM was just plain waste… BUT i would recommend to watch it before going to End Game :) to feel the difference. even Samuel L jackson could not save the constant pokerfaced Brie >_<,0
1175,"Marvel what on earth were you thinking? I'm totally put off by Endgame now. This could have been a good movie ... it should have, but you had to go make it some ideological agenda.2 stars, one for Sam and one for the cat. CGI was good in some parts but not good enough to save this movie. Marvel you lost a lot of fans.",0
1176,"Sadly Marvel has made this character so overpowered as to make the entire cast of the Avengers End Game a pointless afterthought. Brie Larsens' wooden performance was rightly upstaged by a cat and the fact that this woman boasts an Oscar actually diminishes the worth of that reward. Painfully miscast, totally disrespectful to the source material, poorly written and drenched in the ideology of the writers, this movie is the best argument for having Disney broken up for the monopoly they are as very few critics are being honest about just how bad this mess of a movie is.",0
1177,I only watched because of young fury. Minus the fact that Marvel already knows.,0
1178,"As a huge Marvel fan and comic book lover, I almost walked out 1/2 way through.  Boring, bland and non-important to the overall MCU.  This was an origin movie that showed zero character arc and was portrayed as a bland, uncaring person.Top it off with the fact that she cannot be hurt by anything and you have removed any and all suspense from the movie.  It's easy to be brave when nothing can hurt you.  At least with Superman the villains knew to go after the ones he cared about to get him, with this version of Captain Marvel, I don't think she cares about anyone but herself, so I guess she is invincible.  If Disney tried to bring in Captain Marvel at the 11th hour to save the day after the rest of the Avengers have spent 10 years and dozens of movies building a relationship with us, there will be a revolt.",0
1179,"Easily the worst MCU movie I have seen to date. The plot was weak and full of holes, the humour felt forced and immature, the CGI was good but for 2 instances, the music was inserted in strange places and the editing was choppy. Larson's acting, in particular, was unconvincing and fake - there was far too much smirking and posturing, and far too little acting. In many instances it felt like I was watching her doing a skit of Captain Marvel on SNL rather than playing a lead role in a multi-million dollar movie. Her entire motivation for fighting also appears to centre around herself - unlike literally all the other Avengers who fight for something bigger than them (protecting their loved ones, freedom, justice, responsibility etc, which is the essence of a hero).There were plot holes aplenty. She stated that Skrulls can't do photon blasts, so she would know it's a unique power. So then, if she was the only individual able to shoot photon blasts in ALL of Hala/Kree galaxy (indeed, the ONLY ONE we saw who had special powers), why didn't she even question that once? Then she crash-landed on earth, as an alien soldier, and started smirking at the first alien law enforcement officer she saw? Without questioning why this alien was the same biological type as her? And didn't she JUST join the Kree army? Why, then, is she part of a group of ""Noble Hero Warriors""? What, if anything, makes her noble or heroic? And why did Nick Fury divulge all that information to an alien soldier at the drop of a dime? He's not exactly so stupid or 'new' to make such an obvious mistake - he's a full bird colonel with years of experience as a spy, so he'd know it wasn't like Vers would know if the information was true or not. And didn't Vers already say Skrulls can assimilate RECENT information? So why all that history into his career?  If this was just the writers' attempt to tell us more about Nick Fury, it was lazy as hell.I also took issue with changing the Skrulls into refugees when the story for a planet-wide shape-shifting invasion held so much more potential for writing and fight scenes. I thought, with brief delight, that it'd be like Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, but nope, it was nowhere close to that.And there was no ""big baddie"" - in the ""climactic"" third act, Ronan shot missiles, which were destroyed in seconds, then sent some fighter ships, which were destroyed in a minute or so, and then he fled. Yon-rogg (armed with a pistol and shield and NO SUPERPOWERS) was taken out with one photon blast after a ridiculous monologue. And not to mention the fact that Vers gets her power from a light-speed engine powered by the Tesseract, which means she should be no more powerful than Scarlet Witch, who is given her powers by the Mind Stone, but this doesn't seem to be the case.All in all, the movie just felt flat and ultimately, forgettable. I really hope she won't play a significant part in Endgame - just looking at the end credits and seeing the MCU stalwarts' gravitas contrasted with her mediocre, half-mocking performance had me desperately hoping the MCU wouldn't mutilate their final act with this travesty.",0
1180,Other than the Stan Lee tribute and his cameo there wasn't a single moment that I was not bored.,0
1181,BORING.. I wasted my money on this sh!t. I expected more from Marvel. Bad casting and predictable plot.,0
1182,"I don't often write reviews but this movie deserved one. Besides the horrible acting and writing, this entire production redefined the bar for what a generic film is. It kind of plays off as a weird joke the entire time.",0
1183,"Let me start this off with the fact that I almost fell asleep while watching this movie and I don't fall asleep when watching movies. It was incredibly boring. There didn't seem to be on overarching plot, just a bunch of subplots, which made the movie feel disjointed. The only reason I gave it a 3, which I think is more of a 3.5, is for the supporting characters only. That and it wasn't as focused on politics as I thought it would be. It still had moments focused on a feminist agenda though. The supporting characters are really the only reason I didn't leave the theater. Brie Larson's acting was so bland. All her emotions felt fake. Carol Danvers is overpowered for no reason and a mary sue.Also, there were a few things that were retconned from previous films in the MCU just to fit Captain Marvel into the universe. Not only that, but the plot twists weren't surprising. There were massive plot holes, and some things just are not explained at all. The script had badly timed jokes that fell flat, though some jokes were funny.",0
1184,"Unfortunately this movie didn't live up to my expectations. If there's a baseline for Marvel movies this feels like it. There was nothing egregiously bad, but nothing noteworthy or interesting either.Brie was poorly cast for the role in my opinion, or maybe the writing/directing was just off. But Brie's character was overtly stoic to the point of not really being relatable. Power creep in the MCU is also becoming a real issue, with yet another hero whose power somehow exceeds the already nearly invincible established characters.(this is not a mark against this movie specifically, merely an observation ) The movie does fill in some other plot details related to the marvel universe, those are the high points of the movie in my opinion.",0
1185,"Just got home from the movie.  Let me start by saying as a long time MCU fan, this was disappointing. Let's see, totally forgettable fight scenes, maybe one good one?  Nick fury scratched by a cat wtf? CPT Marvel is the source of the 'Avenger' moniker?  Larson's portrayal was wooden, and I know she can act, have you ever seen ""Room""? CGI was sub-par, very disappointing.  Plot holes galore, the movie just felt out of place, incomplete even.  If you REALLY like MCU movie, then go see it, it is still a superhero movie and has familiar characters.  Otherwise, just wait until it arrives on Netflix. (p.s. it is a high 3 maybe even a 4)",0
1187,"Honestly i could have been a good movie, too many plot holes, not great acting or story line... seemed rushed ..also the fight scenes were far from epic... when she finally got the power to  fly , it was so unexciting, ... i don't know i just dont know",0
1188,"Before I review this movie I'd like to say that I tried reviewing at Rotten Tomatoes and my review was deleted, even though I had given an honest, fair & well intended review. I'm going to be sticking to Metacritic from now on.I give this movie a 2.I found the plot not too exciting but at the same time it is a Marvel movie and it isn't too original any more.Some of the actors were pretty good but I, like many other people find Brie Larson to be a bit of a miscast. I feel like other actresses could have easily done a better job. It mostly comes down to her personality and character being unrelatable. It is a common fault in modern movies who push an agenda to make the main character an all powerful female.This character has no faults, no weaknesses, isn't very feminine, but also, not very masculine either. Just sort of an **** Nothing really allows me to relate to her. Sort of similar to Rey from the new Star Wars films.There are other films with amazing female leads such as Alien, Terminator, original Star Wars, etc etc. The difference is, those films made a movie and a story that focused on the story and character arcs etc. This movie focused on a political agenda and focused on identity politics and gender. The story and characters suffer because of this.The thing is, it also comes down to psychology. People don't like to be told what to like or dislike.There are other movies out there that have messages of equality or whatever other political messages. But they don't force them on you or market it that way or guilt you, or divide people. Those movies are actually well liked. An example would be the film Tangerine, which has a good rating from both critics and audience.But the marketing campaign & media has been so hostile towards the audience and tries to spoon-feed ideologies down your throat. They say if you don't agree you are bad. No one likes to hear that so it naturally will create disfavour. But then the company will just label all bad reviews as trolls etc.Just make a good movie. Don't alienate your main viewers or anyone for that matter. Just make a good movie, don't spoon feed anything, don't alienate anyone, don't guilt trip anyone and don't create excuses and put blame on others for the consequences of your actions.Apart from politics, there were some plot holes and a lot of lazy writing that I feel harms the existing lore and events in the MCU.That is why the film suffered. That is why it is a 2 from me. It could have been so much better with a better, less wooden actress/actor and it could have been so much better with more focus on story other than politics.",0
1189,"The wooden, emotionless acting from the main protagonist left this movie boring and forgettable. The supporting cast out shined Brie Larsen on every level. The story lacked direction and pacing. No solid motivation for the protagonist's actions ever surfaced. The main character had no flaws and was impervious so there was nothing to base a hero's journey and character development on.The use of gender politics to force critics and their websites to increase their rating of this failure is sad. This movie cannot stand on it's own merits and so has no business propping itself up on political ideologies.",0
1190,"Brie larson's repulsive attitude is displayed clearly in her performance in captain marvel with it being stale, effortless with seemingly no passion for comic books or marvel movies at all. The only good part of this movie is Samuel Jackson as nick fury except even an element of his character was ruined which I won't spoil. In summary, captain marvel is what happens when politics interfere with entertainment. No one cares about your politics in our super hero movies! I worry for marvel's future based upon this movie, we can only hope end game will not be ruined by brie larson's presence",0
1191,"I was really disappointed with this. Brie Larson was very flat and arrogant from times which made it hard to connect with her. Also, the lack of character development and degrading men in order to emphasize feminism (I'm female myself btw) were off putting too.There were some good elements but I have to say this is the first Marvel film that I fell a sleep in.",0
1192,"Recast Brie Larson before she ruins the franchise.SJW politics do not belong in movies. If a white male was spreading hate like her, they would be fired.",0
1193,Brie Larson felt like she just phone in this role. Her emotions in this movie felt fake to me. one scene u see a a fake tear role down her cheek seemed like she just put a drop of water there. i hope the recast her like they recast bruce banner after the hulk movies. its like she didn't  take her role serious at all. Plot was not good it was almost like EA's Battlefront 2 story mode plot pretty much and that was not a good plot either lol. meaning she switched side pretty fast from being a kree hero to helping the skrulls after trying to kill them... so Skrulls are the good guys some reason... and Captain marvel is the reason teh avengers are called the avengers... she wasn't even well liked in the comics when the first avenger movie came out.. plus how come nick fury didnt tell the original avengers that aliens were a thing in the 1st avenger movie? if he met CM and skrulls years before teh avenger movie. alot of retcon in this movie its almost like what the last jedi did to force awaken. and lastly a alien kitty scratched fury eye out but soem reason fury keeps the cat next to him with his own little cat bed.. after that epic scene in winter solider where fury shows his eye. he still trust the alien cat that scratched his eye out.. oh and teh movie fights were kinda lame the first fight scenes were to dark to understand whats going on. and when CM was fighting her old allies u will see CM destroying them but some how her mentor gets the upper hand out of nowhere. which was liek ok? how did that happen? she is able to body smash a kree fighter jet and one of those giant ships that ronen the accuser used in GoTG vol 1. movie was BAD.,0
1194,Boring awful excuse for social justice. even then it is weak without it. brie larson is boring do not watch,0
1195,"Mala pelicula,copia de la formula ya desgastada de Marvel,poco fiel a los comics,ademas los skrulls son un chiste",0
1196,"I just saw Captain Marvel 3/17/19. I had heard many of the viewers criticisms but waited to see it to come to my own conclusion.  This is the worse MCU movie to date. There are many things that make this movie the worst. First has to be the missed casting of Brie Larson as many critics have said her performance was wooden and lack luster with little to no change in expression through out the whole movie. It seemed the she doesn't take her part seriously and phoned in a poor performance. In the comics she is a strong leader, independent, positive, and heroic. None of these characteristics show up in Brie Larson's performance. Even at the big heroic part of the movie was flat and just a bunch of CG confusing stuff thrown onto the screen.   Part of her performance must be blamed on a terrible, awful, uneven poorly written script. There were times where the dialog was so stilted from one character to the other it seemed like a poor high school play. Ex-specially the scenes between Brie L. and Samuel J. which many were played as the humorous (humor-less) scenes. The music was another of the problems with this movie. Unlike Guardians of the Galaxy where the music was well edited into the movie and enhanced the scenes. In this movie it was jammed into this movie to the point where it was jarring and took me out of the scene. The feminist agenda has to be talked about in this movie. In no other MCU movie up to now has an external real world agenda was forced into a movie that it  changed the movie to the worst. I'm a long time Marvel comic book reader and was amazed and upset that the true origin of Captain Marvel was totally dismissed. The original Captain Marvel was male Kree warrior who decides to become one of the cosmic heroes that chooses to protect earth and its people. He ends up dying from cancer that was caused by the power he used to protect earth. Because of the feminist view they decided in this movie to totally dismiss the deep and rich comic history to displace with a weak feminist character. I have no problem to female lead characters but what I have a problem with is poorly written and acted ones.  Conclusion: Poorly written, cast, acted, and choices all though this movie, where popular agenda out weighs good writing and choices.  Skip this movie you really don't need to see this to watch ""End Game""",0
1197,Just not good all around. I wish I went to see something else. I’m worried for endgame. I’ll watch that no matter what but after that I’m done with marvel if this is the new trend.,0
1198,It is propaganda movie and serves no propose. Useless feminist film. main character is plain and dumb only good for the tv series not a mainstream film.,0
1199,This is a very bad movie. This was able to destroy nick Fury for me and I don't think she will be able to be the main character for the next generation of movies. I very disapointed.,0
1200,"If not for its connection with endgame would say the truth about this movie, it is predictable, with a very weak villain and a boring script, the null charisma of Brie does not help at all, the best the cat",0
1201,"Movie doesnt serve itself or the character, its just a step to what they want to do with MCU. It exists only to justify CM's existance and appearance in Avengers. Disney is tryharding to get people to enjoy this movie by using primal human instincts so people will get fond of that cat - which even steal the show from the lead character. THey are also paying up sites and bloggers to try and put a good word for this movie. Disgusting.",0
1202,"The Avengers were named after Carol Danvers? Are you being for real? And Nick Fury lost his eye to a cat? Seriously? It wasn’t even that funny if that’s what they were trying to be at the cost of damaging a character’s backstory. Also should have featured way more of Phil Coulson. Moreover, there was terrible music and scenes which were as I’ve already mentioned just outright not funny , such as Carol accidentally blasting a cardboard cutout of Arnold Schwarzenegger from True Lies. Additionally , many of the fight scenes had a very low standard of camerawork and choreography making it hard to follow what was actually going on. It appeared as if they were trying to hide weak choreography and stunt men as well as CG fight scenes through the use of shaky cameras and very frequent cuts.",0
1203,"Captain Marvel's plot couldn't have been more idiotic if it had been written in crayon.  Not only did the writers embarrass themselves, they trashed and contradicted well-established MCU canon.  Nick Fury was cinematically emasculated and allowed to do nothing more than coo and burble over a bloody CAT through the entire movie.  Apparently Brie Larson couldn't tolerate sharing the spotlight with a character more 'masculine' than herself.  And the Tessaract, a potentially WORLD-ENDING artifact which was previously fished out of the North Atlantic by Howard Stark after Steve Rogers ditched the plane carrying it--and himself--to save the North American eastern seaboard from annihilation?  Nawwww... It was puked up on Fury's desk by the cat!!!  Puh-LEEEZ!  My five year-old granddaughter wouldn't buy that!  Was this pathetic shill not 'inclusive' enough without pandering to the crazy cat-ladies???  I hope Avengers Endgame can pull the MCU out of the waste-pile into which Captain Marvel has just crashed it.  The franchise was too well-done to be utterly ruined by such unprofessional stupidity.",0
1204,"This movie is not good. Not good to watch and not good for the future of Marvel movies itself. Hacky and trite with a fair support class. The problem lies in its ""star"". The character is not likable in the vein of Tony Stark or Captain America. It has nothing to do w/ gender and everything to do w/ good storytelling. I'd watch a Ellen Ripley or a Diana Prince over this. Brie is not interested or interesting.",0
1205,"""I'll make it very simple and clear: Captain Marvel is really worth a watch. It's just entertaining and visually impressive, exactly what it was meant to be.""A bland movie that does no justice to MCU. I couldn't believe it took seven screenwriters to come up with this script (I just re-watched Cabin in the Woods - the script took just two guys over three days). And Brie Larson... couldn't they find someone who could emote? Look at Wonder Woman, or Alita. A CG character was more capable of showing more expressions than Larson.",0
1206,"TL;DR: To call Brie Larson's performance wooden would be an insult to things made of wood. Brie has all the charisma of hot roadkill on a desert highway. She's the most badly miscast character since John Wayne played a kinda-squinty Genghis Khan in The Conqueror from 1956. Captain Marvel is aggressively-dull, pretentious, & crammed with persecution-complex/female-empowerment propaganda. Thematically the film is utterly-generic. The story is a pointless mess. Search for the post-credit scenes on Twitter, & you'll miss NOTHING for Endgame by skipping it. & you won't have wasted 2 & 1/2 hours of valuable air-sucking you'll never get back.True comicbook fans can find 100 ways in which they disrespect the universe, but I'll critique the film as a Normy.CM tries for the Marvel formula of irreverent banter, & mostly misses. The dialogue is meant to be witty, especially between the 2 Air Force feminists, but it drips with the kind of self-satisfied snark you see everywhere on Twitter. Both actresses try hard to seem like they're not trying very hard.Several lines are absolute cringe. From a feminist caricature of a 'toxic male' pilot: “You DO know why it's called the COCK-pit, right?” Uuugghhh.& from Brie Of The Lifeless Eyes herself: ""I'm not gonna fight your war, I'm gonna END it."" Delivered in her inflectionless, talentless monotone. Girlpower PUKE!Then there's the Amnesia Trope. Writing your character with complete memory-loss should get you summarily sh*t-canned.As for the ""Protagonist"": If you thought Rey from Star Wars was an insufferable Mary Sue, Brie Larson's Carol Danvers brings even LESS charm to the party.They tried to write her as perfect, but what she is is perfectly-joyless. Brie thinks she's too much of a star to put in effort for the cameras.Question for the directors: Why are Captain Marvel's ""toxic male"" co-stars always telling her she can't do stuff, & trying to hold her back? & what's happening behind her vacant, thousand-yard stare?Brie delivers her lines like she's phoning them in from China, & her expressions were added in after by CGI artists in Dubai who are bored with their jobs.As for the Special Effects, they ranged from spooky-good (the de-aging of Samuel L Jackson; never noticed it beyond the first few frames) to low-budget video-game-bad (an obviously-fake Brie Larson shooting obviously-fake proton-bolts from her fists in space, which don't even align with where she's 'punching.') When she FINALLY goes “full-superhero block-of-wood,” the scene is confused & phony AF!She's not a believable combatant; not in hand-to-hand, not in a fighter jet, not in her computer-generated super-suit.An important point; if you're not invested in the story, the over-the-top action gets tiresome quick. Who cares how 'splody the world gets when Optimus Prime defeats Megatron for the fifth time? Just get ON with it.Admittedly Captain Marvel isn't as bad as the Transformers sequels, but it's by far the worst movie in the MCU. Made worse by Marvel shoving this horrible Mary Sue into a final showdown she's earned no role in. Captain Marvel earns nothing she's given, NOTHING, & that's how feminists want it. Disney's making her PIVOTAL to defeating Thanos.That's pure, presumptuous pandering. & Brie thinks MEN have massive privilege.The Bright Spots: Ben Mendelson as Talos, & a genuinely touching pre-scene tribute to Stan Lee. These, & some 90's nostalgia for the soundtrack, are all that's memorable in this otherwise belligerently-subpar cluster-F. Mendelson is so fantastic I was hoping the writers might've had a stroke & let him accidentally kill our bored-looking “savior.”But no, Mary Sues aren't actual characters, who can be killed or defeated. They're avatars for the entire female gender - & to give the embodiment of All-Women-Everywhere any humanizing flaws would be to imply that women aren't perfect - so the writers were too terrified to let you think their Mary Sue might lose for even a second. Just ponderously-bad writing.They should've given Goose the cat his own movie. The tale of Goose and Fury! THAT could've been fun, instead of gag-inducing. Oh, & the way Nick Fury looses his eye is so pathetic it's hard to believe it made it past all the levels of gatekeepers & into the movie itself. Good god, the creative talent of Stan Lee is SORELY missed.To clarify, I paid the ticket price to see How To Drain Your Dragon 2, also in 3D, because I refuse to fund feminist cancer. Which Captain Marvel IS. I had a few triumphant heartbeats when Brie began 'kicking-ass' to No Doubt's “I'm Just A Girl,” but it was so forced & pretentious it felt like the cheap propaganda it was.RottenTomatoes is brazenly shilling for Disney & Social Justice, & is refusing to post critical reviews that give movie-goers the level-headed truth.Tempting as it is, this can't be held against CM, & if Transformers 5 gets a 1 out of 10, she deserves at least a 2.",0
1207,"Awful lazy plot with no enteresting background. The spirit of 90s is shown very simple, it hard to believe. Captain Marvel has so many superpowers, so it is very hard to empathises to her.",0
1208,Maximum disappointment. +1 point only for Stan Lee. A chair is more emotional than Brie Larson.,0
1209,"Amateurish, unsophisticated and massively cringey. The film is completely lacking in gravitas, and substitutes it with dumb, wishful & twee grrl-power. Ruins decades-old characters for what comes across as a petulant, childish tantrum. Obviously the writers, directors and crew have no idea what good sci-fi is, or what good comics read like or good films, for that matter, and thus fail on every parameter they could have possibly failed on. The MCU was becoming, against all odds, an incredible franchise, well executed so far. This film throws all that hard work out the window, and drags it down into Kardashian-like inanity. A Forced, unrealistic plot, with obviously untrue girl-power tropes shoehorned in and all the legacy characters being thoroughly uncharacteristic in order to elevate this mediocre ""hero"". It comes across as little more than an indulgent parent entertaining a tantrum from an ill-behaved and untalented child. Stupid, ""woke"" people making stupid, ""woke"" things to justify their own stupidity, and making the rest of us endure it. Absolute garbage. I hope nobody involved with this twee atrocity is ever allowed anywhere near a film-set ever again.",0

1211,Horrible!Capita marvel and very bad weak plot with pessima performance of the actors.,0
1212,"This film completely destroys MCU continuity and introduces an absurdly overpowered character that totally diminishes any concerns one might have combating Thanos in the future.  Carol Danvers' origin story is bereft of any element necessary for a meaningful and interesting character arc.  All great MCU characters overcome some personal character flaw that results in the emergence of a better version of themselves thus becoming a true hero.  Danvers comes across as a bratty tween overcoming nothing except for the universal ""patriarchy"" represented as a neck restraint which she casts off reveling she was perfect to begin with.   No arc; no substance; just virtue signaling and preaching.  I could reference the bland emotionless childlike performance of Brie Larson.  I could discuss, in depth, the atrocious physics errors of the film.  However, as the banal story of the film already serves to destroy the MCU anyway, what's the point?",0
1213,"Man, that movie sucked. It's actually so bad, it becomes enjoyable to hate it. The only good thing is that I bought ticket for Alita and snuck in another room to watch Captain Cancer, therefore not giving the mouse any money.

1214,The movie doesn't have a real story.The main character has no real challenges or emotionnal moments.,0
1215,"Was not planning to watch this movie due to the controversy but as a Marvel fan I had to give it a watch. The movie has great special effects and fight scenes but the actual movie is boring. I was dosing off through the midway point. I remember falling asleep during Boogeyman(2005) and The Trolls movie with my kids (luckily the movie theater sold beer and no I was not intoxicated) I thought Black Panther was just average but it was way more watchable than this. My 7 year old was excited to see this movie and she also lost interest.Guess they wanted to up Wonder Woman, another crappy movie by making Captain Marvel the most powerful woman alive. They should have went with a male version. Brie tried too hard and failed. She now believes she is the most powerful woman in Hollywood today. I've seen her in Kong and 21 Jump Street and the also sucked. The WTF part of this movie was Fury losing his eye to a freaking cat. This movie was Garbage and no offense to the band Garbage. The highlights of the movie were the songs from Garbage and Nirvana. Until Endgame then, but I expect Brie to stick her face in there as well.",0
1216,"I personally didn't like how they used the skrulls in this movie. I was expecting something much more engaging and threatening then some homeless Skrulls just looking for a new place far away from the Kree to live. In the Comics, these two Empires constantly fought to expand each of their territory, and they didn't care if anyone got hurt in the process if they got in their way while doing so! I expected way more action on earth then we got, but instead we ended up wasting too much of the film in useless moments and on a story of refugee Skrulls that really made no sense! Why for once could they just take a known story that worked from the comics and developed that into the movie? Also, I may be wasting my time asking this question, but why did they have to once again use an infinity stone to grant someone their powers when that was never the case in the comics?! I just hate it that Marvel decided to take a movie that could have been good and over complicate it with things like the Cosmic Cube, which, I am not even sure if in the comic was an infinity stone at all. My final thought on this is, the movie is mediocre at best. The best character in it wasn't even a person but a cat and most of the time was CGI at that!",0

But, because this unnecessary entry in the MCU is a direct lead-in for the upcoming END GAME. And this dumpster fire of a movie just ruined  a lot of my anticipation for that movie. Such a shame. I'm sure Lawson is a fine actress, but she should not have been Captain Marvel.",0
1220,"More Mary Sue girl power stuff. Tired of other peoples political or social justice views being shooved down my throat. Movies used to be about the people in them and the Dynamics, political or social narratives used to sometimes be a part of it, but not the whole narrative.Blaming the problems of society on men seems to contradict the feminist trend of becoming like men. Can't women become, ""successful,"" whatever the hell that means, by doing their own unique thing and not modelling it after male, ""success?""",0
1221,Really wanted to like this being a fan of the rest of the MCU movies but this one just didn't live up to the hype.. boring and slow storyline. Very little character development. Some parts I was anxious for the movie to end already.  Acting was medicore and not believable.. some OK action but not nearly as well done as other Marvel movies. Felt like an after thought by the studio. Save your money and wait for it to come out on rental.,0
1222,This movie can be Marvel's worst movie. This ends up turning on the warning light,0
1223,"PROS:- Woman in lead roleCONS:- Captain Marvel talks and behaves like a condescending, arrogant, spoilt brat and is extremely unlikable- Brie Larson's acting is terrible- The jokes are cheesy, embarrassingly stupid and forced- The plot is clumsily told and unfolds way too slow- Character development done with the most throw-up-worthy cliché platitudes- Way too much long, unproductive, uninteresting, boring talk.- The power levels are not proportionate (struggle with opponent but fly through battleship)- The Action feels like a bad spy/action movie from the late 80ies or at best early 90ies- Questionable moral standards where a kid tells her mother that going on a suicide mission is what will make her feel proud of her.Some of the prescription medications that are approved for treating insomnia include:    zolpidem (Ambien)    eszopiclone (Lunesta)    zaleplon (Sonata)    doxepin (Silenor)    ramelteon (Rozerem)    suvorexant (Belsomra)    temazepam (Restoril)The best though, is CAPTAIN MARVEL !",0
1224,"Where should I start?Is Captain Marvel awful? NoIs Captain Marvel the ""Last Jedi"" of the MCU? NoIs Captain Marvel great and worth watching? NoLeaving aside the entire political SJW Fallout, which has accompanied the movie for months, remains a boring action movie with unspectecular CGI, filled with flat dialogues and a bunch of feminism. The audience follows an overpowered Mary Sue on her journey to completely destroy the Marvel Universe and possibly the MCU, and in my opinion, the movie easily manages to open up the real Marvel fans and I can understand it well when people are pissed off.Attentive audiences will realize within the first five minutes who the ""bad guys"" are and the alleged ""bad guys"" become politically correct refugees and thus the ""good guys"" during the plot.Fury is demoted to a boring sidekick, and the story of how he loses his eye destroys the entire myth surrounding that character. Badass Fury became Lameass Fury in the name of feminism.Also by Mar-Vell, the original Captain Marvel gender is changed gender to make him a female Kree scientist. It almost seems like all good characters should be power women, which was hard to do at Fury. The so-hyped 90s setting of the film is a bad joke that is summarized, told in three minutes and where you already know the punchline. Oh, and since when did you get white NIN Girly shirts in the 90s?The only funny scene in the film is Goose, whose species, as far as I know, does not even exist in the Marvel Universe, which leaves the question of why the cat ever appears in the film, except to create an ""animal"" sidekick with everyone again says: ""Oh, he is cute!""All in all, the movie is a debacle that you do not have to look a second time and there is no spoiler on Endgame either way. It remains to be seen what influence Captain Marvel will take as a character on the plot of Endgame, but I fear meanwhile bad.At the beginning, I asked if Captain Marvel was the ""Last Jedi"" of the MCU and denied the question. I stay with it. If my fears for Endgame and the role of Captain Marvel in the upcoming MCU movie prove true, Endgame could very well become the ""Last Jedi"" of the MCU, resulting in the Disney within 18 months of its second market leading IP on the SJW mania would lose. Maybe Bob Iger will finally wake up and start rolling Disney heads.Finally, a positive thing. Adding a homage to Stan Lee in the intro sequence of Marvel lettering was a really nice idea!",0

1227,"Politics aside, the movie is bad.Is there a lot of politics in the movie? No, absolutely not. So those claiming there is, are wrong. This movie is repetitive, boring and bland. The recon to the MCU is insulting, and wait until you find out what happened with Nick Fury's eye.. it's absolutely insulting. This is why I don't want to watch movies with sjw nonsense surrounding it. The script they gave her was bad, her acting was mediocre, but I can't blame her, they didn't give her a lot to work with, she did her best with what she could. This movie is by no means a 1 or a 5. At Max it Should be a 2.5. WW was great, Alita was great, and so many other female lead movies are great, but those who push an agenda, apparently can't write a half decent script.By far the worst MCU movie, once she has her powers there is no excitement to be had. She is basically Superman, and what made Superman interesting is the fact he fought against people who are equal to his strength. This movie should not have been made, the fans wanted a black widow movie so badly, and it would've been better if we had one. Don't trust the professional reviewers as they have come forward that they do ""access journalism"", which means that if they leave a bad review, they won't be invited anymore. I'd suggest waiting for DVD.",0
1228,"Very mediocre movie. Plot was lame and foreseeable, dialogues were weak, especially the performance of the main protagnoist (Captain Marvel aka Brie Larson). The stars of the show were clearly Nick Fury aka Samuel L. Jackson & Yon-Rogg aka Jude Law. It's a shame, really. Big budget and good special effects. And the way they made Samuel L. Jackson young again.. very good. The movie could have been a solid superhero action movie with a rating of 5 out of 10, if it wasn't for Marvel. I expect more. I expect to go out of the movie and feel thrill and awesomeness. Nothing of that sort happened. On the contrary. I was disappointed. If this is a foreshadow for Endgame, goodbye franchise.Edit: After checking the attitude and performance of Bree Larson in Endgame, I have to put this into perspective. It´s just bad. 0/10",0

There might have been an audible sound in the theater when No Doubt ""I'm Just a Girl"" plays over the final, fully powered, fight.  I felt like we needed to see it to be prepared for Avengers: Endgame and that will be the factor that drives the box office on this film.  As far as Marvel backstory/first movies go:1. Iron Man2. Guardians of the Galaxy3. Captain America4. Doctor Strange5. Captain Marvel6. Thor7. The HulkAdditional deductions for weakening Nick Fury's backstory in how he lost his eye.  Samuel L Jackson and Brie Larson's scenes together were the best parts of the movie.",0
1232,"Just watched even though I tried to talk myself in to not seeing it however I cannot make or give an opinion on what I haven't seen. In short Larson is a monotone automaton with little to no personality, I found a few instances where she showed some emotion and interest but they were few and far between. As to the story in my opinion it is too disjointed, the flashbacks make little sense and don't provide any character development. Speaking of character development, there is none for any of the players in this movie we literally are not invested in any of them and for me the one person who stood out and made the movie for me was who I would consider one of the ""main"" characters in the film was Coulson...that says something when the rest are just there with little to no standouts in performances. In short better than The Green Lantern but not by a lot I can't say it doesn't have its moments because it does but I certainly wouldn't sit through it again, if you are a Marvel fan then go see it by all means you will not be blown away but again that's just my opinion.﻿",0
1233,"I watched captain marvel as of Saturday and gotta say it felt very disappointing. The movie was overly cheesy from the terrible jokes and nothing against brie Larson but poorly written script and wtf!!! origin story. I highly don't recommend this movie and sadly she was way overpowered as a character as in the fact that she had no challenge in the movie from anyone and the choice of villian was weak. Save your money and go see something like Battle angel Alita. Well this movie isn't better than wonderwoman and just as bad as the last jedi, plus the god awful pacing and crappy fight scenes made you feel ""meh"" seen better. The beginning of the movie honestly made me fall alseep for a minute or two.",0

1239,The Movie is one of the worst MCU movies. The highlight of the movie was the Intro and Ben Mendelsson. In my opinion what captain marvel did to nick fury is the same what the last Jedi did to Luke Skywalker. This movie made me view the old MCU movies and the new movies in I totally different light. The epicnes and myth of Fury is totally gone. When I watch an MCU movie again he is for me no more the guy he was before in the movies. All of you who wanna see the movie go ahead and watch it and build your own opinion. The excitement to see endgame after that movie dropped low. I hope for best and looking forward to Shazam.﻿,0

1243,"Angels of deathThe show really shows it is an adaptation of a video game made in rpg maker and in a bad way. It feels like no one put any effort into the writing and no one ever stopped to think about what it was they were doing. The characters are mostly terrible especially the main girl whose only character trait is she wants to die. It is not that she has depression or anything(that could have been explored with nuance and understanding) instead she is simply edgy for the sake of what i only assume is shock value. She barely has any dialogue and when she does it is the same thing over and over. The other main character, zach has a good character design and voice actor but not much more than that, they attempt to develop his character but at least for me it did nothing to change my opinion on the character. The other side characters are nothing special, being quite typical for something in the horror genre. One side character who appears towards the back end of the show is a religious figure and that brings me to my next point. The show tries to have ""hidden"" themes and things to say, the main one being its comments on religion. It crams in religious language and imagery in the back end of the series but not intelligently whatsoever. Instead it feels like the show is saying ""this isn't just a normal anime, we're smart and are teaching you something"" without realising there isn't really a message in the show, just a lot of threads that lead no where and give me the impression that the show is up its own ass and is so impressed with itself. The show is also riddled with plot holes and elements that simpy make no sense, from a character spending half the season with a hole in him bleeding out yet being absolutely fine in the end to the main girl who up till this point had not been violent and very quiet decides to controll a minigun and mow people down for some reason. It's a mess. Another thing is that the shows main genre is horror yet it seems not to know how to display horror on screen. The show relies on lazy jump scares and empty shock value which is completely ineffective and at some points laughable. It fails to be even slightly unnerving and this is from someone who avoids horror movies like the plauge because he is essentially scared of them. I must admit i did not get to the end as the end of the series was aired as specials after the main show had finished and that gave me an exuse to stop watching this trash. It genuinely gets on my nerves that people think this is good and especially when i see the female lead character high up on lists of best characters of the season or whatever the list is.",0

Very wooden performance. The jokes were forced and they all fell flat and missed the mark. The CGI was unacceptable for a Marvel movie. The effects were akin to something you would do yourself 10 years ago on a pc. There is no growth to the character at all, no arc. There is no tension as she is unstoppable and you never feel worried that something will happen to her. Without spoilers, the eye thing is the worst explanation they could have devised.Agree with me or not, but I suggest you take off your fanboy/girl blinders and judge this movie on it's merits, not blindly.

Set in the 1990s.Captain Marvel is an all-new adventure from a previously unseen period in the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for that reason I say it's a new way to see a MCU movie, and it's also crazy, the OST, the humor and the era.. this movie is a bonker!!!Captain Marvel is a very fun time, guys.. it's really cool, fueled by CGI action sequences, and the amazing performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelssohn, BTW Ben M. is very surprising to him that great, he's by far the best thing in this movie, just like Samuel L. for me! Goose the Cat comes at the second place.. I don't want to spoil anything to you about that amazing, funny cat.. but guys, prepare to get your mind blown!!! Also the CGI of Samuel L. Jackson, to make him younger, is AMAZING!!!!!! This is the BEST age-CGI-ed character I've ever seen.. literally!Is it a perfect movie? NOPE!! It has some flaws, it's not a great heroine movie, there are better heroine movies, but it's still a fun one, but still flawed.My biggest issue with this movie is the first 15min, guys, they were super-rushed, even the direction was rushed... There's also a scene when ""a team"" was searching for ""someone"", it was so dark that it was literally so hard to see who is doing what, that scene bugged me so much! It took me sometime to recognize the characters! There's also a very good scene when Captain Marvel was trying to get those lockers out of her hands, rushed, but cool! When Captain Marvel arrived Earth, as we saw in the trailer, things Finally got back to the right course. It was humorous, slow-paced.. a little bit, and all the good things started to happen.And the thing that I didn't imagine to say, is that Brie Larson is not that good as Carol AKA Captain Marvel, she's a very talented actress, so I expected something.. better from her, but she was Brie Larson, nothing more! I hope to see her better in Avengers: Endgame.It's a good origin superhero movie -still not that amazing- with some amazing action sequences fueled by good CGI. I'm gonna give Captain Marvel a B!

This won't offer anything new or intriguing, but will be served up in the exact same boring vein of every cookie cutter ""unique"" opinion Hollywood doesn't have to offer it's extremely bored, exasperated and increasingly indifferent audiences.Of course, if you truly enjoy hurting yourself you could give yourself a proctology for a far cheaper price but that won't help Disney make more of this trash, or help push their narrow-minded world view across an increasing monopoly of the entertainment industry.

What I did see, it was on par with Thor: Dark World in quality (some CM's CGI/SFx makeup looks like it was done in the 1990s) and Ang Lee's Incredible Hulk in pacing/story/script and both of these movies were the least liked in MCU...until Captain Marvel showed up. So hold on to your money and maybe watch end credit scenes online for free...so you know how this new character will ruin the Avenger's End Game plot (I hope CM character does not trash that movie too!!!). As I said, most CGI special effects are just okay but the simpleton-unimaginative story, poorly-timed pacing, underwhelming acting and almost-no character development are the real villains of this movie...And worst use of No Doubt's Just A Girl song with cringe-worthy results...And Brie Larson character is just boring with no depth...does she really have an Oscar for acting???The Best part of the movie (and got the most reaction from the whole audience was the Stan Lee tribute.  Another redeeming part was the Nick Fury interaction and Samual Jackson's time on the screen. Also coming in I thought it was getting to be more political but it was not as bad. All the better Sci-Fi movies are way more subtle about those themes. And the 2 jokes (1 from Nick Fury and the other from the kid)...all the other jokes sucked. I also liked the Orange Cat.  If you are forced by your wife or girlfriend and can not get out of it. Definitely do Not spend any more money to see it on Imax or any other expensive premium screenings nor waste any of your time waiting in line to see it on opening weekend.",0

1279,"Captain Marvel, a truly forgettable and boring experience with Decent Performance by anyone but Brie Larson.Captain Marvel is basically the MCU equivalent of Green Lantern, neither Director nor all the Writer ever understood how to make an MCU Movie, they never understood how the russo Brothers could archive so much praise from Fans and regular movie watchers alike, they didn't understand the late Stan Lee either, how he envisioned Super Heroes, how he portrayed them. Captain Marvel is constantly portrayed as the Strong independent Female that was always looked down to by White Males, how she can easily overcome anything in her way, she is portrayed as invincible, all mighty, sadly they forgot to include emotions in the movie because it lacks effort and emotion. The Actual acting is Provided by Samual L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn and Lashana Lynch, occasional Laughs are also provided by everyone but Brie Larson, I mean, just look at Goose, Goose has more character then Captain Marvel and Goose is only on screen for a total of like 10 minutes in the 2 hour Boredom ride through hell.This is a Movie many might and will enjoy, but critical it is a Failure full of Political agendas, Feminism and dares I say Racism and sexism towards White Male. The movie script should have never been Greenlit and was destined to be a Failure of some sort, if you insult and alienate your core audience then at least make sure the movie is actually good now you have Angry fans presented with a bad uninspired Political Circle Jerk.If you are a Fan of the MCU, go for it, if you have any doubts of going beforehand, don't, just sit this out and wait for it to reach Amazon Prime or other services.",0
1280,"Lets make it very simple and clear: Captain Marvel is really worth a watch. It's just entertaining and visually impressive, exactly what it was meant to be.Just keep this in mind that it's an origin story so don't go looking for an overstuffed complex story. It's just a fun action movie that introduces us to a new superhero Captain Marvel, played brilliantly by Brie Larson. I became an instant fan watching her in this action heroine avatar, something she manages to pull off with ease. Watch her in the action sequences and there's no way you can't be impressed. Viewers were literally cheering for some of the most heroic moments in the film. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is as awesome as always, it's just that his character feels even better and refined than what we've seen. Jude Law is also quite good, and so are Ben Mendelsohn and Lashana Lynch.But the one character that ultimately steals the show is Goose, the cat. Some of the sequences involving her are so hilarious that it was really difficult to stop laughing.Visual effects are excellent, and the IMAX 3D viewing just elevated them. And since it's most importantly an action movie, every single action sequence it delivers is impressive, especially the train sequence. I would call it one of the major highlights of the movie. Cinematography in certain portions is really impressive. Humor, like any other MCU movie, is top notch and really manages to make you laugh.Captain Marvel has a simple-looking origin story presented and executed in a terrific manner. The directors have done a great job with the characterization of Captain Marvel, and that is what makes everything in the film seem so good. The pace is brisk, gore is minimal to no, and there's nothing unsuitable for kids.",0

1284,"The acting was wooden... at best, IF there was a good actor in the move... it was the cat.  The story was pathetic, the special effects were OK, but the way the story completely ignores its own plot points defies sanity. It takes two of the most beloved side characters in the MCU Nick Fury and Phil Coleson, and turns them into sad shadows of himself. In one case it even takes one of the characters most prominent features and turns it into a passing joke. They also completely waste the value of one of Marvel comics most long standing villains.  This was not a movie so much as demolition derby of the MCU (and the comics)... it re writes huge chunks of both just so it can affirm a lead character that has absolutely no character arc, if anything its a character FLATLINE.  DO not waste your money.",0
1285,Absolutely garbage movie that pushes propaganda and senseless plot out of every literal crevice imaginable. Even for 2019 Marvel movie its an absolute joke and Brie Larson is about as enthusiastic as a piece of stale bread.

1286,"Boring predictable nonsense that is an insult to moviegoers, fans, woman, everyone.  Horrible wooden-faced Brie Larson is unlikable and I never cared about her, wanted her to triumph, or even cared if she was there.  I rooted against her, as the protagonist.  Not the response you want to generate from fans for your main character.  The MCU is done if this is their new (stone) face.",0

Brie Larson should be recast as she portrays captain marvel as this grotesquely obnoxious ""strong"" character. Would not recommend. If this movie wasn't a direct tie in to Avengers, it would be fairing a lot worse.",0
1293,"Someone pushed me into this movie, because I am not exactly a fan of superhero flicks. Honestly, this one I should have skipped. It's a superhero without personality and the story is simple, straight and boring. Probably the worst thing that could happen. It's a 2/10 because it's technically ok and the hero is a woman.",0
1294,"This was a big mistep in the MCU. I really did not enjoy it and felt it killed the MCU in the same way The Last Jedi killed starwars. It's sad but true. Brie Larson is wooden, the editing is bad, the script and story were atrocious. The film failed to make me care about any of the characters and there was no real tension.",0
1308,"Seeing that Rotten Tomatoes is unwilling to publish real reviews, I'll post it here.What a terrible disappointment.Ben Mandelsohn, Samuel L Jackson are great as always, but Brie herself seems to be a complete miscast. With many of the superhero roles, you get a sense of belonging when an actor steps on stage. I struggle to picture anyone else filling the roles for Thor, Iron Man or Wolverine - Chris, Robert and Hugh ARE those characters. Same applies for Gal Gadot for her portrayal as Wonder Woman.But Brie.... I just don't buy it. It still feels like an actor playing a role, which is quite distracting.As for the movie itself... the first half is truly a slog to get through. If you go to watch it yourself, see if you can make it through the first half without checking your watch / phone. Much of the ""humour"" falls flat; I didn't hear a single chuckle from the audience during the screening. The heavy reliance on 90's nostalgia was pushed just a little too far - the final climactic fight scene, played out to No Doubt's Just a Girl, was distracting and takes you out of the moment completely.The timeline for the Tesseract is completely disjointed now. The explanation for Nick Fury's eye is insultingly bad and ignores any explanation from MCU comics. Mar-vell is relegated to being an old woman, ignoring any of the character's relevancy to Marvel history.Captain Marvel feels like a convenient deus ex machina, shoe-horned into an established, decade-long franchise just prior to it's climactic conclusion. It feels forced, and using a character that even in the comics has always been deeply unpopular seems like an uncharacteristic miss-step for Marvel Studios (The character's comic run has been cancelled and rebooted multiple times, and still sells poorly)I never thought, given the history of MCU and DCEU that I would say this, but DC did it so much better with Wonder Woman.My advice - save your money. If you want to support great films with a strong female lead, see Alita or the upcoming Wonder Woman 2",0
1309,"Pros - Cat, VFX, Fury, Mendelsohn, LawCons - Plot, Source Material, Larson Guess which parts are more important.Overall it's a waste of an opportunity for a proper Ms. Marvel (One of my top 3 Marvel Heroes pre-MCU) introduction to the MCU that rides on several other Marvel coattails and nostalgia rather than it's own merit.",0
1310,"this movie was boring. The puns horrible. the only good thing about this movie is the support cast you could completely change the main character and it would most likely be a better film. Its about women coming outta their cage while still being caged in the cage. this movies a joke the main actor is a sexist joke and a racist against white males. good luck in you future career hun your gonna need it with those acting ""Skills"".",0
1311,"What should I say? If a cat is THE highlight of a movie (and far more entertaining than the main protagonist) maybe I should have watched some cat videos instead.The movie doesn't tell a good (or even above-average) story and the action is mediocre at best. Some jokes work, but most don't. It all feels a little uninspired and the main character is perhaps the most boring superhero so far in the MCU. Captain Marvel isn't even a hero in the classic sense as she has no weaknesses to overcome and no superior opponent to defeat. The way she is depicted it would be really hard to relate to her - which I didn't.The movie might be entertaining for hardcore fans of the franchise or people that just want to shut their brains off to chill a little. But if you want an inspiring story or convincing characters just look somewhere else.",0
1313,"Wasted. I went to ""Captain Marvel"" with extremely low expectations, so film could make at least a minimum effort to entertain me. But, alas, he failed. It is a pain to watch the collapse of one of the most beloved cinematic universe. I do not know who can be satisfied by seeing a product of such a low quality. Definitely not me. Neither the acting of Brie Larson, nor special effects, nor the script, nor the direction can claim a positive assessment. Marvel Studio had all the necessary resources to do something really worthwhile. But why should they do that? Maybe on the eve of the ""Endgame"", everyone will go to the theaters? As it turned out, this is far from truth. Somebody can try to convince us that the film was a victim of bloodthirsty trolls, but in fact, there is only one victim - the viewer. Let the negative reviews disappear, try to hide the truth, but it’s not so easy to fool us. I hope that the voice of common sense will win, because we, in the end, we deserved more for our sincere fan love.",0

1317,"This movie... Where to start.Brie Larson's character is disjointed and at odds with itself throughout the entire film. I see a lot of people saying her acting is bad, but that's not it. It just seems like really poor writing. The best way I can describe it is that someone told Brie her character is happy, but stern, but fun, but serious, but cool, but conservative, but a free spirit, but powerful, but confused, but sure of herself, but oppressed, but determined, but uneasy; and Brie did her best to make that work. What you're left with is an unrelatable, disjointed 'Mary Sue' character that you feel literally nothing for once the credits begin to roll.As for the movie itself, it's fine. It's not good and it's not bad (but it leans more toward bad). It exists.It relies heavily on forced nostalgia and a goofy CGI cat to try and trick you into thinking you're having fun.The big problem is what it does to the MCU and key characters, specifically Nick Fury.The movie is very 'Girl Power!' which I'm okay with. What I'm not okay with is when you emasculate men to get your point across. Especially beloved, well established characters (Nick Fury).If you really want to see this movie, go ahead. However, if you have any love for the MCU as a whole then I STRONGLY urge you to not stay for the ending credit sequences. No spoilers, but I can see the direction Marvel is heading and it's not looking good.",0

1329,"First off to all the Marvel fans that know your comic history…  You are going to hate this movie as it breaks a lot of comic lore.  Walter Lawson in now Wendy Lawson.  Fury’s eye is lost because…  well not going to spoil it but WHAT!?!?!  Monica Rambeau is a little girl who’s mother, Maria Rambeau is Carol’s best friend from her previous time on Earth.  Frank Rambeau doesn’t exist.  Ok so there is a few of the lore breaking parts and if that starts your blood boiling avoid the movie.I posted an “honest no spoilers” review on RT and it was removed because “I’m trolling”.  Therefore, this review has spoilers at the end.This is a perfect example of bad writing, poor directing and wrong casting.Brie Larson is a miscast.  She obviously isn’t cut out for this part as when it switches from serious to banter her body language and facial expressions look fake.  In the beginning it is established she is too emotional but during the movie she lacks emotion.  They have Carlson for that.  When she tries to banter, she just comes off as petty and smirks.  Her combat scenes are jumpy from bad editing.  Not sure if this is because she lacked the skill to simulate combat or just bad editing.  If I had my choice Yvonne Strahovski would have been in the part as she has the talent and combat skills from her previous roles.Samuel Jackson is good at his part.  They did a wonderful job making him look younger in the film and I do have to applaud the art team for this.  However, his character is another story.  Nothing scream who the heck is this as the scenes with the cat.  Fury has always been a smart tough character until here where is inexplicably trusts aliens and acts a fool at times.Editing is a nightmare.  Enough cut scenes to make your head spin and eyes ache.  CGI is ok and if you want explosions you got them.  In fact every so often they toss it in to keep people awake.Spoilers belowThe movie starts out with a series of dreams/memories of Carol Danvers/Vers time on Earth.  In this memory is a woman, Wendy Lawson and the memories end when the skrull shoots her.  She wakes up and it is revealed she doesn’t remember her past.  Soon she meets the Supreme Intelligence who imitates the woman from her dreams/memories.  After that onto her first mission where she is captured on the alien planet where the mission takes place.When the Skrull are probing Vers mind they somehow discover the planet in question is Earth.  Vers breaks free and fights the Skrull of course escaping the ship in a life pod.  In this life pod she crashes to Earth so some how they made the journey to Earth instantaneously.  Yet later it takes days for backup to travel the distance.After crashing to Earth she meets a security guard who witnessed this crash during the middle of the night.  Asking for communication equipment he points her to a Radio Shack and the pay phone next to it.  Suddenly it is day with the police and Shield arriving.  Guard still sitting there and Vers is calling her squad from the pay phone she upgraded.  Apparently several hours have passed before anyone responded to the call made by the guard when she crashed.A few minutes are spent trying to establish the story as Fury meets Vers for a few minutes before the obligatory attack from the Skrull.  They establish the Skrull can take the shape of anyone yet with just a look Vers realizes that an elderly woman is a Skrull punching her.  The Skrull have infiltrated Shield and Fury sees his first dead Skrull realizing aliens are real.Jump to the scene where Vers is outside a bar when a biker pulls up asking her to smile (Cringe).  When she doesn’t, he pulls his keys and goes inside.  Vers steals some cloths off a nearby mannequin before stealing the biker’s motorcycle.  But she get the key’s?For some reason she arrives at a bar in the middle of nowhere seeing pictures on the wall of a jet involved in a top-secret project.  With no explanation Fury is there and they banter a bit because now Vers cannot tell if he is a Skrull agent.  She asks him several personal questions to prove he is human because Skrull’s have the recent memories of those they imitate.  So, without knowing Fury she questions him about his personal past?Que top-secret base where Fury’s thumbprint lets him on accompanied by Vers who doesn’t need a cover or credentials because…  Yet, after asking about Wendy Lawson they get locked up in an office because bases don’t have holding cells.  With his communicator that they didn’t take from him Fury calls for backup.  Escape from the office, meet the cat and sneak into the records room by blasting the doors because nobody hears it.Now the obligatory combat scene because people in the theater are TEXTING/READING MESSAGES ON THEIR PHONES.  I walk out smoke a cigarette asking the guy at the door what the hell am I watching.  Go back to at least finish the movie but by now I am also reading Reddit posts.",0

1335,"A very disappointing installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain Marvel is a very boring origin story that serves more as feminist propaganda, than as entertainment. The highlights of Captain Marvel were the details it revealed for End Game (which are better found out through an online article than by watching the film). Everything else was just ""meh"". Fury was reduced to comic relief (and as a foil to the strong and powerful Captain Marvel), and the CGI fight scenes looked goofy. The film had a loud, consistent feminist message throughout. Each chance it got it earlier described men as a joke or as a abhorrent entity that sought to belittle females: ""You can't do this"", ""You shouldn't be here"", ""You know why it's called a Cockpit, right?"". Coincidentally enough, each male character spewing insults was a white male. What has been made clear: Larson is a strong, powerful, wise, hilarious, witty, etc. character that will probably single-handily save the entire universe. I hope this is the last Captain Marvel movie - the fans of the MCU deserve better.",0

1340,"I went into the theater as I do with all other Marvel movies, expecting it to be good. Putting aside all public relations disasters and the actresses clear hate towards the opposite sex, being the opposite sex I went in without this in mind. It was hard to watch a character develop into such a one dimensional super hero with such great powers and no real weaknesses that you just can't seem to like as an individual. Marvel in the past has made attempts at least to get you as an audience member to feel for the character, the heroes and the villains. But I just felt awful thinking throughout the movie, ""I really hope the bad guys win."" especially since this is a lead up film that ties in towards Avengers: Endgame.The story was an absolute bore, it actually reminded me of a certain green glowing super hero with a ring who I really wanted to like but just gave up on in the end. I actually ended up seeing it twice because I didn't even care to losing out on a few minutes of the middle of the film the first time seeing it due to running out of my beverage and needing to use the facilities. And oh boy, did I take my sweet time getting back. So of course being a completionist of all things heroes and film, I went back the next day and sat through the boring film again to see what I missed. Not much. Action sequences that seemed rushed and not coordinated correctly. Especially the science and physics behind it all seemed poorly researched. It was like they said ""This can't really happen, but let's do it anyways."" I enjoy flash backs but my goodness was it slow and really hard to want to follow it, twice. Seeing as how this is a story to explain how Nick Fury met Captain Marvel, and how he has both eyes in the film and why he has only one in later Marvel films....it wasn't well documented on screen. It was as jumbled of a mess as is my writing.Overall it had a boring lackluster story which makes you care even less for the protagonist and supporting characters. As well as poorly put together action sequences that seemed to come out of an extremely low budget film. And in the end they were completely forgettable, only good thing that came from this film is the fact it wasn't longer.Sorry Marvel comics and cinematic universe fans and newcomers alike.

Brie Larson had no weaknesses was powerful throughout no real challenge for her or character devolpment. The fight sequences were lackluster and dull the villains are underdeveloped. Save your money and skip this movie.,0
1356,"This movie killed the MCU, a complete insult to the comics and mcu, they turn the legacy of Mar-Vell into a joke turning him into an old lady, this movie turn Nick Fury a bad ass character into a comic relief, and last they **** on all the rest of the cast and universe naming the  avengers for her, if end game dont right this wrong... im not going to pay for a marvel movie ever again.",0
1357,"Stale wooden acting,shoehorned narrative and boring premise.Might bring end of hero films which I am okay with.",0
1358,"Contrary to most people, I at least watched the movie before writing a review. Captain Marvel is a bland, uninspired, deeply lacking any sense of personality whatsoever. Her character has no arc, Larson's acting is not good. I lost it when she ''did'' her outfit, it's supposed to be one of the most important aspects of the hero, it should give her a sense of identity, not looking at a t-shirt from a 7-year-old. People giving this movie praise just because of the controversy are doing a disfavor to this movie. The score, the cinematography and the script all lack a sense of direction. Samuel L. Jackson was cool tough and the Skrulls but other than that this is a mediocre movie and Larson is not the best direction going forward. The first time Marvel really let me down. Oh, at least there's a Nirvana song during the movie, that was cool. Props to that.",0
1359,"This movie is quite possibly the start of the marvel movie implosion. Captain Marvel is being injected into endgame out of nowhere and will quite possibly ruin the entire franchise. There is a reason this character got a reset so many times... and please write ""strong female"" characters that have some flaws, we are all sick of this mary sue crap.",0
1360,this is not a marvel movie in the traditional sense. it's not entertainment. it's someone's agenda disguised as entertainment and pushed on you. I hoped for the best but wasted my money. the trolls are right. don't watch it. save your money and go watch something else.,0
1361,I felt like i was being pushed to the left and generally force fed it. the characters were all boring but nick fury was great. I hope Marvel learns from this and we don't have to suffer through move disgusting content like this.,0
1362,"Went and saw this film (Thankfully I didn't pay out of pocket) and it was just.. It wasn't good, lets just go with that. I am a huge fan of Marvel films, and have been watching them since way back with Iron Man. I really love everything the entire cinematic Universe has built, and worked into a huge cohesive story. The issue with Captain Marvel in particular, is that you could skip the entire film and not miss a darn thing for Avengers: Endgame. She doesn't grow or change as a character, and there is no real threat.Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is great as always, and he's probably the only reason I didn't walk out of the theater. Don't waste your time or money with this one. 0/10",0
1363,"Captain Marvel is such a Social Justice Warrior movie, in 2019 and that  had bothered everyone I know, besides Cap Marvel  is just to Over Powered and that isn't nice, and sometimes it just doesn't fit MCU.",0
1364,I'm sorry but this didn't look great to me. Saw it just now & it was boring. They could've cast better actor,0
1365,"Is amazing how they managed to screw one hell of a character like miss marvel/captain marvel is, turning her into a superman whitout argumental fundaments, is just puting OP things just at your face and say ""because **** you, that's why"" when you ask, why, how and when the **** did she learned to do that...(simple but cclear example: breathing in space), disappointing missargumented, ad hurry to the most whatsoever",0
1366,"Character is boring, plot is boring, the biker saying smile just felt like it was put into the movie to make all the marvel fans that said she should smile look bad, even though whenever she does smile it looks fake. Don't watch, it should have no real effect on endgame, unless Marvel got overrun by idiots who want 'captain marvelous' to easily defeat thanos and rob the movie of all tension.",0
1367,"So much cringe. So so so much cringe. Their attempt to make the ""girls look tough"" came off as world-class a-holes. The humor was off-putting. Worse yet, the plot line of aliens that can blend is such an easy win to screw up. How did you screw it up? I want my money back.",0
1368,"Well i was tired of the SJW thing going on for while and decided to give this movie a go ....watching it online first, to see if i needed to go to the theaters for it. Well was very glad i did not. This movie has nothing memorable about it and everything is so bland and so done and predictable. Brie Larson is as boring actor as the character she portrays. My wall had more expression than her.Her cracking jokes was like so humorless than when she added a smile, it felt like the T1000 trying to smile in T2. At least Arnie was playing a robot and it was funny but here..my word..this woman has no sense of humor. As the movie goes on, you can get the feminist agenda at every corner. Worst of all is how they massacred the origin story of Captain Marvel...a man . As a comic fan i know Carol Danvers is Ms Marvel but we all know Disney would never have that on screen because the current Ms Marvel is a Pakistani in the comics and Disney preaches SJW and equality but when it comes to money and profits, never bank on ethnics in lead cast , surely not for their feminist flagship. Anyway... save your money. Even the end credits have nothing to offer that you don't already know",0
1369,"A subpar Mary-Sue action flick. Making a good story was purely a secondary goal for the writers. The reviewers and the producers of this movie are all in on the feminist ""girl power"" agenda; the positive reviews are entirely political and not objective whatsoever.",0
1370,"As a Marvel studios movie it was an absolute disappointment, I don´t care about genders or colors or whatever PC mumble jumbo BS they want to bring into society nowadays  by using this way to do it; I do care about the plot of the movie, the effects, the acting, the beautiness of a great story, the essence of a film taken from comics and brought to life!! But what we got....... a HUGE FEMINIST cringe message again that men are evil and they get all the good stuff from life while the poor, innocent and immaculated princesses are struggling in life thanks to them. Thought it was going to be similar to Wonder Woman but nooooooo, even though the acting from Brie Larson was terrible, like a vegetable xD (kinda reminds me to Kristen Steward); Mr. Stan Lee proly is crying and screaming in his grave from this fiasco of feminist movie; NO MORE SJW please do whatever you want with your lifes but do not mess with the things we love and care that are part of our universe; freaking move on; transcend as humans.C´mon Marvel go back to the great movies!!",0
1371,"From the very beginning, Captain Marvel was a nonsensical borfest. The acting was terrible aside from Jackson. The story was pointless and only exists to set up a deus ex machina for End Game. The titular character is by far the worst main character in the Marvel franchise. Closer to a DC character. I'd go as far to say WORSE than a DC character. The feminists plot threads didn't do the movie any favors either. Would not recommend!",0
1373,It is definitely the worst and most boring movie of all the marvel universe so far.,0
1374,"Disappointed in Brie Larson's performance, lack of charisma throughout the movie. Very 1-dimensional, and where are the weaknesses? Boring.",0
1375,"bad acting, slow,boring wouldnt recommended to anyone i like. worst MCU movies by far.",0
1381,"You can skip this one. I wish I had.Films that demean one group to advance another aren't healthy for children to see. It's a bad message - shocking that it's Disney! Sorry Marvel, I like diversity via unity and teamwork; not blame and division. That's the message I want to see from you and the talent you employ.Everybody is unique with special talents. Kids should learn to focus on that more, and to obsess over race, gender, and so on less.",0
1382,"This movie sucks in every sense of the word. God damn, These **** SJW are ruining marvel. I hope they don't repeat what they did in Cap marvel, EVER.Don't waste your money is this peace of abortion",0
1383,"I don't watch super hero movies (I watched the original batmans and the first spiderman + ironman movies, and thats it), and I was dragged to see this one, so please keep that in mind as I have no bar to compare it to other super hero movies with.  That being said, the only highlight of this movie was Nick Fury - who is only there for comic relief.  The main character (captain marvel) is a charisma-less block of wood with zero personality, unless being bipolar is a personality.  The best way I can think to explain the plot is to compare it to Rogue One.  It's all over the place, and at times feels like it doesn't know where it's going - the pacing is an absolute nightmare.  Overall, this is a movie that no one asked for, and that no one needed.If this is how most super hero movies are, I think my staying as far away from them as possible was the right call.",0
1385,"the nays have it. so many reviews yet i had to add my 2 or less than 1 cent. movie started out ok yet by the time they got to earth, the make up for Nick Fury and Coulson was so odd that it added a very odd and even bizarre element to the movie. from then on it was teetering from odd/bizarre to sometimes ok yet, by the time the movie ended, i could have cared less who was winning or who won. a terrible experience. give this movie a pass and wait for TV and even then not pay tv, make sure there are lots of commercials.  another thing is Samuel L. Jackson, who i used to like a lot, when the economy almost broke in 2008 because of the big banks, he started to work for those big banks, i found that to be traitorous. now when i see him i think ""traitor""! too bad he is in so many movies. why did he do that? he didnt need the money??? he sold out!",0
1390,"There's about as much personality in the main character as a road accident. The writing was lightweight in that regard, but I feel a better actor could have put more life in the same movie script.",0

1401,"Boring, dull, nothing like the other Marvel movies, which is too bad if it is an indicator of where Marvel is headed, especially w/ the uptick from DC w/ Aquaman and now how Shazam seems to be be being rated.",0
1413,"I wasn't excited about seeing this movie but I was hopeful it would change my mind, it didn't.  This movie was dull and boring from beginning to end.  Not once during this movie did I think, wow that was cool or man, I 've never seen that before. Marvel strong armed me into watching this movie by sticking Capt Marvel in End Game, I hope she's better in that movie.",0
1414,"After seeing this, I wasn't very disappointed only because I knew that I was right about how this movie was going to go. The plot was very generic and quite bland to Marvel standards, the comedy actually was one of the redeeming factors, and Goose the cat stole the show and my heart! Samuel Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn and Lashana Lynch were the standout roles. The twist toward the end of the film was pretty much expected but was held off for the last ten or so minutes toward the end. Overall, the movie is a very weak beginning of 2019 for Marvel and it's the weakest entry in the empire that is the MCU.",0
1417,"Worst MCU movie. Everything gets even worse when nick fury calls her a warrior and the protagonist calls herself a warrior hero. Seriously? To call yourself a hero? The hero should always be the last person to do it. The hero title has to be earned, not said. Simply ridiculous.",0
1418,"I feel like you could have replaced our main character with a cardboard box and it might have been a little better of a movie. Plenty of great female heroes, but I didn't feel any character growth here. All around, this movie was pretty boring.",0
1419,Disney Studios is making the same mistake again and again. That's how empires fall. They are ruining one franchise after another with their short-sighted politics.,0
1420,"As an avid comic book reader, and someone who has been on top of the MCU movies, this one by far was the worst.  Taking all of the other movies in relation to it to review it on its own, I'll go ahead and speak on the movie itself.  This movie itself feels forced.  The storyline has some good points, I loved Goose (the cat) and Samuel L Jackson was good in this movie as well.  I loved the idea of Monica Rambeau being in this movie, but they way they retconned her into this movie, as a comic fan, really irritates me.  She was Captain Marvel well before Carol Danvers was, and if I had my say in it, would have been a much better Captain Marvel than Danvers, who was generally looked down upon in the comic universe.  That being said, the movie itself was very boring and dry.  The Skrulls were very generic and boring as a enemy and Talos didn't impress either.  As usual with most MCU movies, the CGI was excellent, but Brie Larson as Captain Marvel was very stiff and rigid and emotionless.  They took the life and character out of something that could have been much better.  The ending fight was rather rushed and sketch, with going from someone lost in what their powers were to full ""super sayan"" to No Doubt's - I'm Just A Girl (which is a real awkward song to play during a fight scene by the way).  In the end what we get is a sub par, boring, and rather lackluster introduction to a MCU character who is portrayed as rigid and stiff.  If their goal was to make a political statement, which I feel they jabbed at from time to time, but really wasn't anything that bothered me. Some emotion and overcoming her situations would have made Captain Marvel much more acceptable. Alas, all things aside, this is a boring story arch reconned in a bad way, that is easily forgettable.  Hopefully if they plan to flesh her out in End Game and make her more endearing to Marvel fans, then maybe she will have a better future going forward.  Unfortunately, this movie is not a good start to the storyarch of this character.  Its one I won't be bothered to watch again.",0
1421,"Childish plot-holes, minimal character development, lazy writing, and an overall feeling of rigidity/stiffness in some of the roles, including Captain Marvel herself.I'm especially disappointed in the lack of any real struggle or obstacle for Captain Marvel to overcome, apart from just the mission itself.My general annoyances:Can anyone who destroys that kind of engine become as strong as her?Did she always know that chip in her neck was holding her back? Why didn't she take it out earlier? She just randomly assumed it was a controlling device holding her back instead of what gave her powers at that exact instant?Did she really just burst through her limit on the first try at resisting an oppressor?How did she know how to control her new immense powers so easily?Why did they leave the Skrull scientist alone on Earth? What was the plan? Just to spill the beans?Why did the Skrulls even bother attacking her, without high-powered weapons, on Earth, if they knew she could steamroll them on their own ship?Are we really expected to believe someone capable of single-handedly ripping though a massive space ship, likely made of much stronger ""foreign"" metals, while flying, would even be bothered in a fight against 4-6 Kree?What does getting back up over and over again as a child/teen have to do with anything? We've seen every other MCU hero show persistence despite being knocked down, and we didn't need flashbacks to their childhood to explain how they are more than ""just a girl"".The first half of Iron Man, Captain America, or Antman were more engaging, emotional, and deep that the entirety of this movie.This movie was: Conveniently just enough power, for just the right scene, because explosion, because woman.",0
1422,"Before I begin, I should like to include a short preface to say that I was aware that Larson had made some comments but I didn't know specifically what she said and I didn't have any expectation that it would impact the film. While it's on my mind, I'd also like to remind people of the sense of excitement that the post-credits scene from Infinity War inspired. When the Captain Marvel logo flashed up on Fury's pager, people were excited for that. Bear that in mind when people who didn't like this film are called sexists, woman-haters, misogynists, or just trolls. People wanted this film to be good.So with that said, nothing in this film made any kind of sense. None of it was believable. I'm going to just state it right now: Carol Danvers is a Mary Sue. That term gets tossed around a lot so I'll clarify what I mean. An MS isn't just an exceptionally strong or powerful character. The key feature of an MS is their relationships with other characters. Do they have obstacles? Interpersonal conflicts? Do they have goals that, despite their raw power, struggle to achieve? How do others treat them? How do they treat others? All characters are ultimately different but archetypes exist, and some characters fall into certain patterns of behaviour that could be described as belonging to the Mary Sue archetype, and Danvers is one of them.I'd like to remind the reader that this is a spoiler review. If you don't want details about the film, stop reading.Carol Danvers is dispassionate, disinterested, disdainful, rude, and dismissive; her demeanour is constantly one of somebody who cannot be bothered, who doesn't care, who appears to feel a sense of exasperation, almost a jaded ""I haven't got time for this rubbish"" attitude; and yet, she is well-liked by people who meet her for the first time and, in time, almost idolised.The story takes place in 1995. She is formerly of the USAF and, after a crash in 1989, was taken from Earth and pressed into service with the Kree. She has the ability to shoot energy blasts, for reasons which are explained. She has very little memory from her time on Earth but as the story progresses, she learns more and more.The story basically begins when she is captured by Skrull after a mission. They interrogate her but she escapes. She crash-lands on Earth and, despite the Kree being a space-faring race, the standard protocol apparently is to stay in the open, interact with the locals, and be honest about being from across the galaxy with whatever law enforcement shows up; that being in the persons of Fury and newly-recruited Coulson. She clearly considers Fury to be beneath her, explaining why she's on Earth with a consistently bored tone, admonishing him with a constantly condescending attitude. She explains that Skrull are shape-shifters and at one point, in a local tavern, they need to prove to each other who they really are. Fury tells her about his personal life, that she has no knowledge about anyway, but she accepts it, and she ""proves"" her identity to him by destroying the tavern's jukebox with an energy blast. She faces no protestations, no moral consequences, for destroying somebody else's property for no reason.Her old mentor in the USAF is working on experimental technology and, despite her being very young and very much less experienced than other pilots, is personally selected to be the test pilot for this new tech.Her former friend in the USAF has retired and lives with her daughter, yet she very quickly overcomes Danvers' amnesia and bizarre powers and even joins the cause at the risk of her own life, by Danvers' persuasion; which in turn would result in leaving her daughter to be raised by her elderly parents at the drop of a hat.Talos, a former enemy, has lost people he cares about to Carol and her team; yet, he needs her co-operation because she holds information in her memories that he wishes to retrieve. Now that's all fair enough, and indeed, at first, he coerces her co-operation, but then he takes her at her word that she'll co-operate. Talos is looking for a spacecraft that contains his family and dozens of Skrull, refugees from the Kree-Skrull War; upon finding it, one would expect a Kree warrior, in uniform, would be very poorly-received; yet she has to deal with no conflict. She literally just says, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know [that we were the bad guys all along]"" and that's enough to prevent an angry mob from forming.By the end, Fury idolises her so much, he names the Avenger Initiative after her USAF call sign, which wasn't even explicitly mentioned; he just spots it in old photo of her. A character who wasn't even mentioned until the 19th film, and wasn't seen until the 21st, turns out to be the motivation for Fury to form the Avengers in the first place.The character limit prevents me from expanding any further. The most important problem is that Danvers is on a pedestal and it's unwarranted.Thanks for reading.",0

1425,"This movie felt really long when it's not, Brie's performance was less than i expected and i had good expectations about this one for being a Marvel movie.",0
1430,"Not the best, not the worst in the Marvel lineup. Brie Larson pulls of a good super hero, and is very likeable. Sam Jackson is always entertaining, although the de-aging process was a bit unreal. To me the pacing was a little bit off and the humor could be better balanced. Still Captain Marvel feels a bit by the numbers albeit still very entertaining. If this movie was released before the bar was set by Iron Man I would probably rate it higher.",1
1431,"Not a fan of the 2012 rendition of Captain Marvel, lowering my expectations I was lead to be pleasantly surprised. I really liked how the MCU brought in the Skrull and Kree. The Skrull especially were much better as a story element than I had hoped for.",1
1432,In short the worst MCU film yet. The attempted humour fell as flat as that in a DC film. The story was dull. The action and CGI was uninspired. Larson's acting was wooden and unconvincing.,0
1433,"Within the first 10 mins, I was already bored. This was a drag to watch. The jokes are flat and forced. The action average and uninspired. The whole thing was littered with every cliche in the book. Certainly one of the lesser movies in the MCU roster.",0
1435,"If the goal was to make the MCU less appealing to the masses, this is a recipe for how to do just that. If the goal is to make a career for yourself in the woke minority circles of Hollywood, well, then you nailed it.",0
1437,"So here I am again swimming upstream, though apparently this time the stream is full of sexist right-wing republicans who just can't stand any woman speaking truth to power, or, more to the point, telling all the white male losers that the rest of the world isn't putting up with their bigoted supremacist crap any longer.Probably a lot of these dudes are the same idiots who enjoy a film like ""John Wick.""Captain Marvel, of course, is pretty darn good.  As action adventure flicks go, the story is better than most, and it provides enough character, action, and humor to even keep me interested throughout its 124 minute runtime.If you don't know Captain Marvel's backstory, doesn't matter.  I knew nothing about the character going in and if I missed anything as a result I still haven't noticed.  OK, well, I'm still wondering about flerkins, but I guess I grasped the main point.If you like costumed heroes you should definitely give Captain Marvel a look.And for the guy who called this film a Disney ""money grab,"" just what the heck do YOU think the film industry, or every industry, is all about?  Thank you, Captain Obvious lol.",1
1438,"Was hard to sit through .. Brie Larsons acting was terrible, the weird plot didn't help either.",0
1441,This movie is just another example of what's wrong with Marvel and Hollywood these days. These feminist are killing movies by putting gender politics and propaganda into them. They put male characters down to make the female ones look better. This movie does that a couple times. And even if you take that out of it the movie still sucks.,0
1442,"People said they the trailer looks bland, but I was hype for the movie. Then, I went to see the movie and it was...eeh. It's like watching along 1 hour TV show and it feels like it belongs in phase 1 MCU. Not something excited to see after watching Infinity War. Somethings in the movie doesn't make sense like you can make a list out of it.",0

Honestly nothing even happens in this movie captain Marvel literally just walks around for 2 hours and then fights this guy for 5 min (The fight scene was awful!!!! and that guy who was the villain was the villan for like 10 min). Besides the CGI and larson's decent performance this movie really didin't have anything going for it.

1454,"unfortunately it suffers from a poor script, lackluster action and a badly cast leading lady.",0
1456,"Ok, It's a big problem with this movie. And I have to say that's about Brie Larson which is terrible in acting here. I watched after this one the Room movie, and there she is good, cause it's her style. Captain Marvel looks terrible. It seems like she want to be a strong woman, but she is not. And it's like in a bad theater. It makes this movie very bad and It's not the only fault of Larson - it's a problem of people who made this, who chose the actress. There are bad jokes (Cat, are u serious?) and it killed Fury, because it doesn't make sense after all He is a military guy with a hard past ( And we can see his behavior in the previous movies). And I'm sure that they just wanted to make a movie for new audience to make more money may be or to be in a trend of feminism or something like that. It was obviously a wrong decision. I don't like that because it spoiled my time. And you know what? This character will defeat Tanos ( I think) in the next movie. I really wanted to see the end of the Avengers but I feel that it will be much worse than 1st one. If they will do such thing again I wont go on next MCU films to do not spoil my mood.",0
1458,"Há muito no Capitão Marvel para enganar, desapontar e aborrecer fãs de quadrinhos e seguidores do Universo Cinematográfico Marvel, mas esses problemas foram sugeridos e discutidos ad nauseum em outros lugares, assim como os comentários ofensivos de Brie Larson",0
1459,"They contradict things already in existence in the MCU &  the main character has no story arc what-so-ever.The plot has horrible pacing & is also very inconsistent.The music feels like a very brief after thought to confirms the 90s era time line & is occasionally too loud to hear everything else happening in the movie.The digital affects used later in the movie are obvious & well under what Marvel has grown their fans to expect.The de-aging software was either inconsistent w/ agent Coulson & Nick Fury or they used it sometimes & did makeup other times.  Either way, it was distracting & again, below the standard Marvel established with Tony stark in earlier films (as well as other characters like Hank Pym).This really was the worst Marvel movie I've ever seen & I include Electra & the old 90s fantastic 4 movies.  The SJW parts of the script were incredibly transparent as well as lazy writing & how they portrayed men throughout is pretty disgusting & insulting (Fury checking the alien's body to see if his penis size is larger than his is unbelievably absurd & ridiculous).I actually see the beginning of the end for Marvel movies after phase 4 & believe me I hope I'm wrong.  I've loved the movies (for the most part) leading up to now but after endgame I'm done w/ whatever this MCU turn into.",0
1463,"This is probably the worst Marvel movie I've ever seen. Boring plot, dull and soulless main character, she doesn't show any kind of emotion throughout the whole movie(probably because of the political agenda the movie is pushing), She is just another Mary Sue. The only good in this movie is  Fury (Samuel l. Jackson).",0
1464,"Our feelings have the capacity to spark decisions that when strongly justified, leave a legacy. Notice Captain Hook: after losing a hand to some flying brat and a crocodile. His pain and fear fueled an ambition dedicated to ridding Peter Pan in order to rest peacefully. As a result, James Matthew Barrie’s creation remains to this day one of the most iconic villains across literature, theater, and cinema. There’s no similar emotional drive from anyone in Captain Marvel, a movie that shows how badly Earth needs someone out of our own world to fight off the great evil Marvel Studios created.The problems start with the aliens. Remember how Star Trek famously used its aliens as cultural symbolism for more abstract concepts based on the time each episode and movie were made? I remember during my college years twice watching the old Star Trek episode, Let That Be Your Last Battlefield, where the crew meets two beings white on one side of the face and black on the other, to represent the Civil Rights Movement. Marvel’s cheap way of utilizing that is through its alien race of the Skrulls, shape-shifters who could be anyone at any moment: Nick Fury, Stan Lee, Thanos, etcetera. You know, exactly what Invasion of the Body Snatchers did. Yet boys watching this movie will five minutes later forget the overbeaten communism/terrorism allegory as it’s used improperly.The other world outside our planet, Carol’s home of Hala, feels less like something that will captivate viewers of all ages, and more a like bland inspiration off anyplace that isn’t the United States, leading into unintentional offensive territory much like how Doctor Strange insults the culture of Buddhist monks. Talk about lost opportunities! At least the actual human characters are represented better than the fictional ethnicities of blue-face and green-face; still doesn’t make them good role models, however.Brie Larson fails to empower women into being perfect leaders as she expresses no prodigy in her performance of distracting plasma-fists—at least Scarlet Johansson puts SOME effort into Black Widow. Captain Marvel marks a massive step-down from Captain America, a man who, unlike his female version, still manages to convey a smidgen of believability through clear strengths and weaknesses. While Marvel Studios' Black Panther coincided (perhaps intentionally) with the Black Lives Matter movement, this movie seems to be well-timed (also could be intentional) with the rising feminist movement. The problem with that is they don’t know how to make a good movie out of a suggested political agenda.Heck, Brie is just doing the opposite of what she intends, degrading both men and women with her pathetic moments. The origin of her costume colors tries for inspiration, and a scene of claustrophobic corridors midway through has the thrills, and the explanation to how Nick Fury got his eyepatch is appropriately funny, but all the highest points coupled alongside Annette Bening’s painful exchanges with Brie (seriously, they barely let the other finish their sentences) render the cool moments worthless.The heavy reliance on flashbacks establishes another reason why Captain Marvel goes against what it wants to achieve. While events depict the genesis of S.H.I.E.L.D., it turns annoyingly obtrusive to see Carol’s memories of getting back up after falling down when a conversation would have sufficed. Not to mention the cameraman makes everything too dark and foggy in space and didn’t even bother thinking through how to shoot the scenes in California. The intense lack of care from everyone behind this project tempts one of the Skrulls to shout, “I’m the captain now!” Or better, “There’s no crying in baseball!” Yeah, there are plenty of nineties references in this movie set in that very decade, but not for plot purposes, just aimless nostalgia. These include the kind-of-funny: taking a long time to play a CD, but mostly the cheap: “I’m Just a Girl” playing over the final fight, and a Terminator 2: Judgment Day rip-off of, “I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle.”It’s straight-up insulting how much this story copies familiarity, including all the lazy plot conveniences that subject this entire screenplay as a massive step down for Marvel Studios. For instance, Carol flies an escape pod perfectly without ever having seen it before, then crash lands by coincidence in her home of six years earlier (of all places)! Marvel’s ship must have let its anchor down way back in 2014 yet somehow keep rowing. Thus, they sunk.",0

1481,"Captain Marvel is another Mary Sue without any charisma.This movie had me in a depression state, it was very bad.If you are a true Marvel fan, skip this one or you will feel bad, really.The plot conveniences of this movie are absurd. This character comes from nowhere and the Kree been sitting all this time waiting for her before trying to invade.There are also full of weird politic injection and crige-worthy feminist quotes.Why are you doing this to us? This is extremely wrong and makes me sad to no end.Leave the Marvel franchise alone, this is a fantastic world and dosen't need your weird agenda push.",0

1499,"Yes, I Actually Like This MovieOh dear I’m going to p*ss off a lot of people with this review. I honestly didn’t have a ton of problems with this movie. And before you call me an SJW or anything like that. I am a conservative person who happened to enjoy this movie. I understand that you’re exhausted of politics in film, But vote rigging down the “Want To See” score on Rotten Tomatoes is not going to fix anything and is a bit unfair. But that’s not the point of this review (I had to say it to give the fans a message), The story while not perfect is decently written and the performances of Jackson and Mendelson are terrific (Though Larson is decent).",1
1500,"Captain Marvel as a movie is trying too hard to sell viewer the fact that it's a movie about female superhero and it's ruining the potential of the movie.I like Brie as a Captain Marvel but she needs to work on her acting skills because she was trying to blend two extreme sides of two different characters together and it was just too awkward and fake. If she toned down the ""i am a hero"" act and ""i'm funny"" act it would go together way better than it actually ends up being in the movie.In the end, I was able to have some fun with the movie but I wouldn't call it a great experience like with some other MCU movies.",1
1503,"boring garbage cash grab full of political toxic pc culture, please dont watch this movie",0
1504,"The worst MCU movie. The only thing consistent about this movie is Brie Larson's face... which is just bland. The villains and the supporting characters are more colorful than the protagonist. Even the cat received more praises than the leading actress.The story is also meh but I hate how they tarnished the origin of Nick Fury's eye. Unlike other MCU movies wherein the hero goes through heavy training or a defining moment of heroism Captain Marvel was already strong when the movie started and the reason for that is because she was caught in an explosion. The conclusion is, skip this film. Unfortunately, if you hate this movie then you hate women for some reason",0
1505,"Exciting movie with a strong female lead. Interesting commentaries on war and female empowerment. It's no wonder that the fanboys are trying to sink it's ratings. Brie Larson adds strength and humor to one of the most powerful heroes in the Marvel universe. As always, it's best to listen to the professional critics. Let the disgruntled fanboys wallow in their insecurity and misogyny.",1
1507,"Great movie, showed the strength of one of the most powerful heroines of the MCU. For those who are talking about Brie Larson acting, remember she got an Oscar.",1
1508,"Compelling story, good VFX, Samuel L Jackson was memorable as a young Nick Fury. Great sense of humor. And ties perfectly with Endgame.",1
1509,A fun Marvel movie that never hits the heights of the best in the Universe but never comes close to the bottom. Overall a mid 7 a B+,1
1511,"Much much better than I expected. It's not perfect, and there is some cringe-inducing stuff in here, but Captain Marvel is indeed a VERY worthy, if unnecessary, addition to the MCU.",1
1512,"Have to say that I, my wife and 4 other friends, all enjoyed this movie. I thought that there was plenty of humor, and an enjoyable story. All of us thought that Brie Larson made a great superhero and her skills as an actress showed well with a great subtle performance. The trolls probably don’t even know that she is an Academy award winning actress.  Thoroughly enjoyable.",1
1513,"Amazing! So much fun! Go see it for yourself. Exceeds expectations. Great message there, with engaging characters especially Carol. Great role models. Funny and full of action and visual dazzles.",1
1514,One of the best superhero movies ever. Brie Larson as usual never miss. Great story and interesting plot. Supporting cast was phenomenal. Strongly recommended.,1
1515,"Spectacular, funny, and engaging. Captain Marvel can be considered one of the best films this year. Acting was great, everybody stands out. Visual effects were impressive and action was great. The story and plot fits perfectly within the MCU with familiar faces and interesting details and backstory. It's so much fun that once you see it, you can't get it out of your head. You'll find yourself thinking about it alot, so that you can't help but feel the urge to see it again.",1
1516,"It exceeds my expectation despite the fact that some people hate it so much, but not me, not me. Anyhoo, haters gonna hate. I just try to take a neutral point of view to watch the movie. Enjoyed it and if you are a Marvel fan you will respect it. Stan lee intro makes us all clapping with emotion. The storyline is twisted and surprisingly well connected together. Love that part of Annette Bening(but not enough time on seeing her as _________ ), flashback layer after layers for few moments but won't get bored. Like the way they do to show the intelligent. The atmosphere of the film is a bit odd but in a strangely good way, especially the skrull or lets say talos. Can not compare to captain America and iron man, this atmosphere of the movie is totally different.  Can see that they try to create a kind of new style (kind of like guardians of the galaxy have their own feeling) for captain marvel. All in all, It's stunning to see all CGI, the world building like kree city and her power in Imax. Have to say the cat is a bit disturbing me tho. Get that thing away from me!!(jokin",1
1517,"I don't know why this movie has so many bad reviews. Just watched yesterday and it has a lot of fun. Just a little overwhelmed at the beginning but great afterward.Don't take too high expectation, ignore recent news, start with a fresh mind. Like I do so after seeing a huge worse review.I did not give 10 due to the imperfection of the main actress. Some scenes she looks a little weird.",1
1518,"The movie was a lot of fun, I enjoyed the pacing, the jokes were funny, and Carol Denvers was a great character played by a great actor. The supporting cast was good, Fury and the green guy were amusing.I loved the tie ins to the first Captain America movie, and the way it linked to the greater MCU.",1
1520,"I really do not understand how people like the other marvel movies dislike this one.  Its a solid Marvel film, very fun and exciting.  The third act like most marvel films turns into too much action for me but that seems to be the going trend with what audiences want.  All and all this movie is worth watch, Brie Larson and Sam Jackson are amazing.  Who wouldn't want to be Captain Marvel after watching this movie?I hope there is a sequel and definitely cracked the top ten in terms of Marvel Movies for me.  Go out and see for your self.  Very good film.",1
1521,Was a good movie the lead looked great solid progression the main negative for me was the movie left a lot of plot holes,1
1522,i enjoyed everything about the movie but at times it felt like there was too much going on on screen and it was a little fast,1
1523,"I loved this film, my husband loved it and so did my 11 year old son.  Brie Larson was funny, heroic and did the role justice!",1
1524,"The movie was really good. Solid mid-tier MCU movie. For the negative comments I’d read/heard I disagreed with them. I didn’t have the same problems with the film that some people seem to have. If you like MCU movies, you’ll like this one too. I thought the characters were good, the actors were good, Sam Jackson was awesome, the tone was good, the visual effects were good, moments were earned, the story was good and subverted my expectations in several ways. Yup. Good movie.﻿",1
1525,"Haters gonna hate but it is a good movie. She has a lot of charisma. Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel, is a formidable force and a welcome addition to the MCU.",1
1526,"An entertaining, fun movie introducing perhaps the most powerful character in the Marvel universe.  I feel that Brie Larson did a good enough job, but I would like to see a little smoothing out the rough edges in future appearances.  Story is pretty good with some twists, paced well, despite the back and forth with different times in character development.    This film is not Infinity War level great, but its a good start.",1
1527,"Clever, fun, and heart-warming.Great performances all round.Thoroughly enjoyed it.Both times.",1
1528,It's a very human exploration of both the main character and supporting characters. Captain Marvel knows how and when to use humor and you'll find yourself laughing more often than during some of the more serious MCU movies. The story is developed will with good pacing and I found myself identifying with the lead throughout the filmYou should go see this movie.,1
1529,"Definitely not the best and not the worst Marvel movie.Not the greatest graphics for such budget, have some story holes, also not much action scenes, but still better than Black Panther and Infinity War, not as boring, at least have some kind of logic and follows their own universe rules, so you do not feel like you start watching one movie and finish by watching another.",1
1530,"I saw the movie twice and enjoyed it. It is your classic superhero movie with a lot of action, but also some slower moments. A great entry for a new hero.I really don't understand why people say ""this movie is a forced feminist thing"". This is simply not true.",1
1531,"Overall, great movie. It's got great action, effects, and humor, and is everything you expect from a Marvel movie. There's interesting twists, and some fun surprises. I was a little leary going into it based on what I saw online, but none of it was true. There's a strong message if you're looking for it, but there was no politics or feminist agenda pushed in the movie whatsoever. If anyone is on the fence about seeing it from people's reviews, I strongly urge them to go see it for themselves.",1
1532,"Realizing the writer's hands were tied having to tell an interesting origin story and weave this into the large Marvel through-line, I enjoyed this movie a lot, good action, lot so humor. Brie is great.",1
1533,"I really enjoyed the movie.  The pace was good and the characters were well-developed.  I figured lots of comic book fanboys would be out in force hating on this movie because it is not faithful to the source material at all.  If you want a movie version of the comic, this isn't it.  But as a movie and an extension of the MCU, I really enjoyed it.  Some have described Brie Larson as wooden and laconic.  Have you met a female fighter pilot?  I think she just about nailed it.  I saw a lot of people saying there were a bunch of ""yay feminism"" moments.  I disagree.  I didn't think there were any ""in your face"" moments like that at all.  It certainly celebrates that the lead character is a woman, but it didn't treat the character differently because of it and didn't demonize men at all.",1
1534,"This movie was good.  Well worth watching, especially leading up to End Game. It wasn't perfect and didnt' have to be.  Left wanting more, which is a good thing.  People need to get over themselves, stop looking for something to be triggered about or if it didn't match the comics.  Learn to have fun again.",1
1535,"Nice and easy movie at once. Action on the spot in the spirit of Marvel, graphics at a good level, the plot for the sake of the plot (it had one turn that surprised me), humor on the spot - it is a little and it is appropriate. The second scene after the credits is stupefying: either Marvel is confused in his world or we are fooled",1
1536,"It's not pretentious. The promise was a film of origin and was exactly what was delivered, exceptionally.",1
1537,"Oh geez, looks like the “fandom” is out in force in the user reviews. Couldn’t wait to get in here and have your collective voices known. I was with you on The Last Jedi, and agree it totally ruins Star Wars. That’s where our similarities end. To watch the “fandom” backlash against this movie and this actress begin months before it was even released because Larson didn’t fit your mold of what a female lead heroine should act and look like was very eye opening for me. “The Fandom”, as you like to be called... you are what they thought you were. Don’t sit here recite action movies where you enjoyed the female lead to prove your point. Wonder Woman? Ellen Ripley? Sarah Connor? Alita? Here is food for thought: in the Captain Marvel trailers, if Larson was in the super sexy Ms Marvel outfit kicking ass instead of the butchy captain marvel suit, I bet most of you wouldn’t have much to say. A little t&a makes the blues go away. If they would have stuffed Gal Gadot into a cover-all suit the entire film, you guys would have lost your collective sh*t. Look, it’s ok to not like an actress. It’s ok not to like a character. It’s okay to not like what an actress says or that she doesn’t smile enough. But you have to ask yourself, are any of these things worthy of the level of effort and collective hatred it has taken by the “fandom” to let the world know it didn’t like this non-smiling bit*h and her lame character. Seriously. Why?? Oh I know, you are trying to save Marvel from Disney and not make Marvel SJW.Well guess what? The movie is good. The actress is good. The story is good. It’s absolutley NOT SJW, no more so than the original Star Wars a New Hope where the princess mocked her male saviors for the entire second act.I’m not saying you have to like the movie. If you didn’t that’s fine. But at least give the movie an honest score. Giving out 1’s and 2’s just to have your voice heard and claim some type of moral victory. You know, as a group, the “fandom” could use their collective voice for truly noble protests and invoke change. Instead we have a collective group of fans, predominantly male, who have nothing better to do with their time but complain for months adnaseum about a frickin actress not being smiley enough in a trailer for a character they apparent hate anyways. Oh, BTW, you and Brie Larson have the same enemies. You know, the middle aged, male, white critics that shredded Alita?  Yeah, the very same ones! The irony is amazing.At the moment I’m posting this review, Captain Marvel is sitting at $153 million domestic and $455 million globally for opening weekend. So go on, keep posting 1’s and 2’s while you know each and every one of you paid to see the movie this weekend, and despite being prepared to hate it, you actually found it was pretty good. Shhhhhh, don’t tell anyone. Just be a loyal sheep to the “fandom” and post a  score of 2 on metacritic. I liked the movie a lot. I love the Marvel cosmic universe and this movie captures it beautifully. To see “Vers” overcome her captors and become a true omega level hero was pretty epic. Cmon guys, you have to at least admit that. This movie did not  “derail” the Marvel machine as the “fandom” had predicted. Its not the overtly feminist, man shaming film you predicted either. It’s just another Marvel origin story brought to film, with just enough girl power stuff in it to make it right. Can’t wait for Endgame now. And in the future how The X-men are introduced to the Avengers. Exciting times to be a comics fan that grew up in the 70’s and 80’s, getting to see these characters brought to life.",1
1538,"I liked the style and tone of the movie. In addition to that I really enjoyed the fact, that a woman was the superhero and the protagonist.",1
1539,"The movie was great. Ignore all the beta males who can't handle a woman being in charge or having an opinion. The pacing is good, the CGI is great, Brie Larson is a good fit as CM. The sound track gives it that 90s feeling. I had a couple of ""eh"" moments with the cat and Nick Fury, but I realize they have to throw something in for the kiddos. It's a pretty family friendly movie as well unlike infinity war. If you're a fan of Marvel Movies in general you are going to like it. Laughing at the haters because this movie is gonna make a lot of money and Disney will be drying their tears from bad beta male reviews with cold hard cash.",1
1540,Captain Marvel was a fun origin movie. I like the fact that it wasn't presented in a straight forward manner. Most of the flashback works very well and feels natural. That actors are pretty solid. The FX were really nice. I think that the younger Colson didn't work all that well. The music was fine and very focused. And it was pretty funny from beginning to end. I give it an 80%.,1
1541,"not bad, not great... still much better than aquaman.. Marvel has set the bar so high for themselves, when something isnt at least on par with what came before, it feels like a miss.",1
1542,"This movie was a blast! It was so worth it - a fun ride, and it will get you pumped to see Endgame next month.",1
1543,"As far as MCU movies go, this one is slightly above average. Not quite Captain America Civil War level, but definitely above Thor 1 & 2. Plus, great soundtrack.",1
1544,"O filme no início parecia ser algo confuso, mas é incrível como de repente tudo mudo e tudo aquilo que havia causado dúvida ou intriga se encaixa de um jeito que te cativa de uma forma surpreendente. Samuel L. Jackson está  de uma forma um pouco mais humorada mas o cativo que seu personagem oferece é tão bom quanto o de outros. Marvel surpreendeu mais uma vez, incrível!",1
1545,"Here's the thing. Leaving all the other crap that was going on surrounding the weeks leading up to the movies release. It really isn't that bad of a movie. The main problem which I think alot of others had with the actual movie is that the movie and script were both filmed and written to fit the 1995 time era, hence many scenes seeming so cringeworthy! the CGI was not as well implemented as I would have hoped but and it was a marvel to watch the various action scenes in the movie non the less (no pun intended). With respect to the leads acting skill, I do not think she is bland but rather the character was written that way to fit in with the Kree warrior being an emotionless being. All in all I enjoyed the film better when understanding the cinematography and writing's time era. Word to the wise, 2 end credit scenes, the mid credits is the one to stay for, Youtube the other!",1
1546,"Just saw the film. I went into it with low expectations becuase I'd seen and heard mixed reviews, but I enjoyed it. Brie Larson was very likeable and charismatic as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel despite so many saying she was anything but that. Samuel Jackson brings his A game as Nick Fury yet again as well.It's another fun MCU flick that helped make the wait for Endgame much easier.",1
1547,It's often hard to depict an extremely powerful character but Marvel tried and it works. Not the best but great movie. The visuals are beautiful and the action is fun. Goose is phenomenal and Fury is awesome. 9/10.,1
1548,"I have nothing to say, this movie was a movie. It's not the weakest Marvel movie and it's not the strongest. It's the penultimate chapter to a decade long saga that will, for me (and hopefully Marvel) conclude in late April. The only people who would need to know of my qualms toward this film are the writers, directors, and actors. And if they want to know, they are more than welcome to reach out to me personally. Chances are good they don't care how I feel; I gave them an 8 after all.",1
1549,"Another solid entry in Marvel Cinematic Universe. Brie Larsson had great chemistry with Samuel Jackson, their buddy-cop dynamic carried the movie. My only issue is that there was no effort made to make Kree planet at all interesting, another bland alien world, they should have taken notes from James Gunn is all I'm saying",1
1550,"I wasn’t going to post a review but then I saw all these reviews here. Lol at all these trolls posting low scores from their basement. It’s one of the best marvel movies to date. Solid acting from everyone, a good plot and message.",1
1551,Pretty good movie. I wasn't really a fan of what had been said by Brie Larson coming into this movie and wasn't really a fan of the movie making it seem like guys in the military just suck(when they were making fun of her). I thought it had some funny moments and enjoyed the Fury moments. Good performances by Jude Law and Samuel L. Jackson. Also had a very interesting end credit scene. Didn't really enjoy the Skrulls being the good guys and how Fury lost his eye.,1
1552,"Captain Marvel is a good superhero movie. Her backstory made sense as did her motivations. Going in I was concerned they would pull a Mary Sue. No need to worry.  Marvel understands what is needed to tell a compelling story that develops a character.  I have seen all the Marvel Movies to date.  It is easily in the upper third for me, and I am a 40 year old male.  You can guess how much my two girls liked the movie.",1
1554,"I thought Brie had solid moments in the film. Overall, I would give it an 8.5 out of 10. It was fun and when I went a second time in order to take my kids, I actually liked it more than my initial reception (which was likely closer to 6.5 out of 10). I think a lot of these very low reviews are people who are entirely prejudiced against the actress for things she did not say, which are based on things that were taken out of context in some way. Additionally, and this defies all logic, they simply did not want a female led superhero film from Marvel. Either way, even with some aspects of the film I did not care for, it was a fun, action driven film that makes me even more impatient for Avengers: Endgame to get here. Ignore the really low ratings and judge for yourself.",1
1555,Captain Marvel is a solid and fun entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Excited to see whats next in Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel 2.,1
1556,"This is a great introduction to the character in the MCU. The acting is fantastic and believable, while the special effects look great. The story starts off very slow (for the first 20 minutes or so), but then turns into a entertaining and funny movie. The beginning was just ok, but the middle was filled with action and funny moments, and the end of it was awesome. This movie is good.",1
1557,"Though its title character is lacking in personality, the film tells an engaging, empowering story through its likable supporting cast and impressive visuals.",1
1558,"The final installment of Marvel’s phase three and the end of the Marvel cinematic universe is nearly upon us with “Avengers Endgame”. It’s not the true end technically but it almost has that feel. Endgame will be the final time we see Iron Man, Captain America, and maybe even Thor again on the big screen. Captain Marvel shows the future of phase four and beyond that she will share with the likes of Spider Man, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and many others. I will start by saying that going into this film, I didn’t know anything about Captain Marvel. Never read any of her comics and didn’t know her background so this film was a complete surprise in story and character to me so basically I went into it with completely fresh eyes. The film opens right away with a nightmare from Vers aka Carol Danvers (played by the lovely Brie Larson). We experience her in a plane crash with a alien approaching her with a flash of white light as she gets shot at. This scene is a central part of the films entire story and third act. She then shares scenes with Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) during some fight training leading into their first battle as a group with Djimon Hounsou (playing his same character from Guardians of the Galaxy) and Gemma Chan. The films first act does suffer from some confusing sequences and I did find myself a little confused and scattered with how the first 25 minutes of the film was laying out the story. I don’t know if was the editing or how the script laid out the structure but it’s not something that is a problem for Marvel films usually. Once Carol crashes on Earth, that’s when the film gets going. We are treated to many funny sequences especially one where she crash lands into a Blockbuster Video and this is because the film takes place in the year 1995. I will say that this really makes me miss having them around. Her scenes with Sam Jackson are some of the best moments. They jump from set piece to set piece with hilarious banter and action sequences. We get to know why this working relationship was such a crucial part to the end credit sequence in the end of Infinity War. Now, some people maybe asking how well the de-aging special effects work in the film. As you know, Sam Jackson and Clark Gregg needed to be de-aged for the film due to it taking place more then 20 years before the events in The Avengers. I am glad to say that Sam Jackson’s de-aging looks flawless. They did a fantastic job and can hardly tell that any effects were used on his face at all. The same can’t be said for Clark Gregg as many scenes due look a little to CG on his face, especially some expressions. It’s defintely nowhere near as bad as Tron Legacy de-aging though but I forgive it in that film because that’s when this effect work was just starting. It has come a long way. I have heard some people upset with Brie Larson’s performance here. I can admit at first, I wasn’t fully buying into her. When we look at past Marvel films, stars like Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. were just beyond perfect playing Captain America and Iron Man. They just fit the roles so perfectly. Like I said before, I don’t know much about Captain Marvel so I can’t make a comparison. As the film goes on, Brie Larson starts to feel more and more like the character I would imagine her to be and by the end, I couldn’t wait to see her in the upcoming “Avengers Endgame”. Every moment in third act bridges our journey to Endgame (make sure to watch the end credit scene). All in all, Captain Marvel is another good addition to the Marvel Universe and definitely makes you wonder if the sequel will show us the War on Kree. Phase four of Marvel is headed in a great direction and Endgame can’t come fast enough with a worthy addition of Captain Marvel.Grade: B",1
1559,perfect movie you should see this the captain marvel must power full super hero in MCU,1
1560,A great fun movie. Very entertaining and a fanatstic introduction of a new character to the MCU.,1
1561,"A slow start builds up to an overall strong addition to the MCU.  I have read the comics and this portrayal of Danvers is spot-on, which I very much appreciate.  I didn't think Larson's acting was a strength though...  I liked Nick Fury, Rambeau, and the Skrulls very much however.",1
1562,"Ignore the alt-right basement dwellers, this is a pretty fun action flick. Nothing groundbreaking, but very entertaining. Solid acting, great CGI, kickass music and a beautiful message. Worth the experience on the big screen. It could have used a little less action and a bit more depth of character development, specially with Carol Danvers, but it will do until Endgame.",1
1563,"Short Summary NO SPOILERBUT FIRST....We are all spoiled with great marvel movies these last couple of years that the expectations for every new movie is so high that the disappointment if a movie is not as good as ""Infinity War"" or ""Thor Ragnarok"" is even higher. Let's think about Capatin America the First Avenger for a second, it was an ok/good movie BUT the sequel ""Winter Soldier"" changed the game (one of MCU finest) with the right writers & directors with a clear vision for the characters. ;-)NOW TO CPATAIN MARVEL .....GOOD: Brie Larsons performance was dope (with what she was given with the script) especially the second half of the movie. (SO DON'T LET THE TROLLS FOOL YOU, she IS CAPTAIN MARVEL). Sam Jackson as young Nick Fury and the chemistry between him & Captain Marvel is great. Ben Mendelsohn as Talos pure gold. Goose the Cat+ some Plot twists / suprises & the 90s setting was nice. The visual effects (de-aging technology) & captain marvels full binary power was off the chain.BAD: The biggest issue is the script & direction by directors Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck. Both never worked on a big budget movie like this and that you can tell. The plot structure & the pacing is all over the place and the characters/dialog weren't really well written to their full potential. They really didn't have a vision for the characters & story. The movie is trying to fit in an origin story, the set up for Avengers Endgame and set up for the cosmic future of the MCU. It's just too much. Starforce & Ronan the Accuser was a complete waste btw.OVERALLGood Movie, Great Performances, Great Cast, Great Effects but suffering from a weak script & direction.Marvel picked the wrong writers, director(s) for this movie. They should've gone with someone more experienced.BUT CAN'T WAIT TO SEE PART 2 GETTING THAT ""WINTER SOLIDER"" TREATMENT ;-)AND... HOW BAD ASS SHE'S GONNA BE IN ENDGAME WITH THE RUSSO BROTHER DIRECTING.Go see it in theaters7/10",1
1564,"It is not bad at all but it lacks epicity. A LOT OF Marvel movies are better than this one. At last we see how Nicholas loses his eye. The first minutes are in space and it looks well (good start), then everything happens on Earth (1995), and in the end there is a fight that lacks substance. It's not an action movie but a mix among 60% drama, 15% comedy and 25% action, it's a ""buddy movie"" and Nick and Carol have good chemistry. There are deceptions and plot twist but they didn't ""touch"" me. The villain on duty is not memorable but talking about him would be spoilers. Fury and the supporting characters are wonderful and raise the film and help the drama that Vers takes, that although Brie Larson's performance is good, the film is light. It reminds me at times to Men In Black, the races and persecutions of Star Wars, ID4 and some other movies (that is, it drinks a lot from other films and copy them). Wonder Woman is way better.P.S.: if you know about comics you will not like the twist but I review the movie, not the comics.",1
1565,"Similar to the 2016 ""Ghostbusters"" remake and 2017's ""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,"" ""Captain Marvel"" is neither the flag-planting feminist anthem, nor the culture-war-dismantling failure that either side of the aisle would have you think it is. It's fine. It's a movie that's neither worthy of significant praise (beyond it being watchable and easily disposable, that is) or substantive criticism (it is terribly formulaic). This is simply ""a movie."" Something you can pop on in the background while doing something else in your house. The action is competent. The humor is okay. The character work is thin, but not much worse than your ordinary b-tier Marvel solo flick (i.e. ""Doctor Strange,"" ""Ant-Man,"" etc.). It's just simply not worth all the fuss. Plain and simple.",1
1566,Great movie! Much better than trolls try to make it look)) Def recommended for MCU fans,1
1567,"Fun, easy going movie, as fun as Aquaman and a good introduction leading to Avengers in April. Well worth it the ticket money and IMAX was awesome.",1
1568,"There is honestly dislike coming from 3 sides, people that dislike Brie Larson, the whole DC vs Marvel and those that just general don't like the movie so the movie wasn’t going to get great reviews anyhow. This movie is by no means perfect, but it’s entertaining. I had my let down with this movie, but it wasn’t due to acting, just story points. I thought Brie Larson performance as Captain Marvel was pretty good. Her and Samuel L Jackson play well off each other. This in my opinion was a solid enough origin story for Captain Marvel can't wait for her to throw down with the other Avengers.",1
1569,"Great movie! Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson are both great in their roles and they have an amazing chemistry together. Captain Marvel is coming to beat you, Thanos.",1
1570,"Easily one of the best Marvel movies. Brie Larson is relatable as a badass woman who just doesn’t give a **** about smiling to please angry incels. She’s just being normal. I don’t get people who say Captain Marvel doesn’t have a good backstory, as clearly they have not understood what it’s like to be mindf***ed and put down by people. The chemistry between Larson and Law is awesome as well.",1
1571,"It's a decent movie, not as good as I was hopping, but it's not the pile of trash many people are making it out to be.",1
1572,Awesome for many reasons... The most important one: a female character that can do great things and not only living in the shadows of others such as Gomorra and Black Widow.,1
1573,"I don't get all those negative reviews. As an old fan of Marvel comics, there are serious implication here. The plot is very very different from the original, but Capitain Marvel movie must be seen as a complement of the whole MCU - This is a not a stand alone movie and in fact I saw this movie as a introduction of Marvel to the End Game. Yes, it's not the best MCU movie and shouldn't BE, since it's a middle story of an epic (for me the best of all times) -> ""Avengers infinity war"" - If you take all the content and story acting int the MCU context that makes the whole sense and also leads me to think what will come next on the Endgame - for me Mar-Vell in the comics as much in the MCU isn't a forgettable movie. I rather say that in the MCU context it is a twist, and I love the hang cliff twisted stories. It just ads spice.ps: what if in the End game we could see inside the quantum reality, the comics reality portrait into a parallel universe of the MCU, where the things goes differently. What if? #mymindisblowing comics be a parallel universe of the MCU, Doctor strange might know better than us :D (don't blame me but I love this!!!!)",1
1574,This is a good movie. It is not as bad as some people make it out to be. Larsen could have been better in the movie but I liked her performance more the second time I saw it.,1
1575,"Great movie, fun and entertaining. I wasn't expecting that much and that's why I'm giving a 9. Clean storyline, makes sense in the marvel universe and it is great we are getting to the point of seeing secondary characters like Carol Danvers on screen.",1
1576,So much fun! Really sets up Endgame well. All the 90s music and references were very well done if you're someone who was going through college at that time. Looking forward to seeing it again!,1
1577,"This is a fun movie that's more than just a mindless popcorn film but not as groundbreaking or daring as Black Panther. Brie Larson's Captain Marvel brings all the snark of Starlord with Iron Man's swagger and Captain America's command presence. Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury is hilarious, and I really liked the friendship between Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch). The 90's references are fun to watch, as are the dog fights and some of the melee battles. My biggest problems are twofold. First, the movie has tense points up until Captain Marvel regains all of her powers at which point it gets ridiculous. Secondly, they take the female empowerment message a little too far with some snide comments against men in general. Yeah, I get it it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. But it detracts instead of adds to the story.",1
1578,"Don't understand all the fake hate with this film. If you enjoyed any of the Marvel movies you will like this one. The movie is well paced with some areas it could be improved, but I felt the acting was good and action was well executed.  If I had any issues it was that the movie was quite predictable and did not do anything new, but I feel that in this instance its not a bad thing.  Those of you looking for a Winter Soldier will be slightly disappointed but if you go in and watch it for what it is you will be pleasantly surprised.  All in all this movie for me was much better than Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Thor 2, even Iron Man 3.  I really enjoyed this! also, the amazing final half was just great to watch.  Stay for the end credits, which will just pump you up for the next film.",1
1579,"I really enjoyed it. Reading some of these other reviews you'd think the movie is laden with propaganda but it's really not.  I went in expecting and looking for it to be honest, and other than two lines that made me roll my eyes I found it to be an enjoyable movie.  Make no mistake, the people whining about this movie are as fragile as the people they criticize.  99% of the people giving this movie 2's and 3's are mad about the lead actress's politics, end of story.",1
1580,"I think people need to calm down. This movie is much better than all these reviews and ratings portray. Just because Captain Marvel isn't Iron Man or Captain America doesn't mean you have to hate every detail about her; overpowered; bad acting; too fast paced; blah blah blah. Ok, there may have been a few cringeworthy and cliche moments, but the movie overall was quite funny and went along with a pace would expect from a superhero film. Stop disrespecting Brie Larson, she is a great actress and her perfomance as Captain Marvel was great. Everyone is saying how she was expressionless; just remember Tony Stark was a cocky **** and the first two Thor movies were quite average. Samuel L. Jackson, yet again, played Nick Fury extremely well and entertainingly and don't get me started on the cat (dope af). Despite the fact that he ruined Dumbledore for me in the Fantastic Beasts second movie, Jude Law made for an awesome villain. The action was incredible and the plot line was steady and made sense, despite what people say. Marvel managed to link this movie very well with Infinity War and have left us in suspense for the events that will occur in Endgame. I loved this movie and would recommend it as a MCU fanboy. 9/10",1
1581,I've been a big fan of the Marvel movies since they kicked off the MCU with the first Iron Man in 2008 and since that time the movies they've released have generally been good with a few stand out movies and one or two not so good movies.Well it's my opinion that Captain Marvel sits smack bang right in the middle which is no bad thing as at the end of the day I really enjoyed it which to be honest surprised me given how mixed the reviews have been.I think the only sin this movie committed was to allow itself to be hijacked by two armies of public opinion who are using the Movie in the same manner two Parents stuck in a bitter divorce would use a poor Child in a silly game of one upmanship.It's my hope the Movie can stay the course and come out with the success it deserves as I would love to see more of Brie in this role.,1
1582,"A really enjoyable MCU film. It relies on the formula but that is a good thing, because the formula works.",1
1583,"LMAO at all the negative reviews - guess those ""reviewers"" don't appreciate homage films as I saw several influences from other films (Top Gun, MIB, T2, GI Jane ) baked into this. Overall, this film worked as a filler to introduce a potentially major player for the upcoming Avengers End Game movie. While largely predictable, the movie was nonetheless entertaining. I'm noticing a lot of Brie Larson haters in the negative reviews ... almost as if some of these ""reviewers"" just made accounts to disparage her. Worse than Iron Man 3? hardly. I will say not as good as Captain America Civil War, Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther, or Avengers Infinity War...",1
1584,"A little slow to begin with, but improves greatly. Good humor and action mixed together.",1
1585,"Ok, so judging the Movie just by the movie, I have to say, that I really dug it. This doensnt mean, that there are no flaws. What didn't quite work was:- The Character of Carol Danvers didn't feel quite right to me, but i won't judge if it's because of the Script or Bries acting. Just Bries Appearance in the mid-credit Scene felt totally different and i trust the Russos to flesh out the Character in different ways- Some weird Song choices (But didnt really bother me)- Some Moments didnt work (one especially)But thats it for me. I went out having a great time.I think the character will become better with more Movies, like Thor and Cap whose Origin Movies werent great also.Also for the Score, i wanted to give it 7,5/10, but it feels more like a 8 than a 7",1
1586,Fantastic movie.  The movie hit all the right notes.  Is it the best Marvel movie?  No.  But it's definitely in the top 5 for me.  Brie Larson did a great job and overall the movie was just fun and I'm tempted to see it a second time in the theater.,1
1587,"Within the limits of the load bearing plot elements constraining the movie (the range of freedom for a prequel is somewhat limited), I would say they have done quite well here. As an aside, it is fairly clear that this title is being review bombed.",1
1588,"This was a pretty funny and enjoyable romp. Lots of wink-wink references and some good effects: Samuel L. Jackson's de-aging shows we're not far from old actors playing themselves as younger characters.  Like most movies today, a bit too long. The ""man-babies"" seem really crushed to see how well this movie is doing.",1
1589,"This movie was a lot of fun, and my 15-year old daughter was grinning for the last 15 minutes. Complex origin story, strong relationships, and self-discovery by more than one character, plus some kickass action scenes. I appreciated how Carol Danvers' character evolved, and also enjoyed seeing Fury and Coulson at work in the field, making it happen with sidearms and cheapbody Impalas. I am also enjoying the display of weakness by the haters here; everyone's suddenly an acting critic, ha, ha! Go run off and watch Olivier in Henry V, or DDL in Lincoln, or Marlee Matlin in Children of a Lesser God and then come back, incels, and make some informed comparisons!  We'll wait.",1
1590,"It is a real shame that so many people have taken to review bombing the latest outing from Marvel because Captain Marvel is a fun treat for audiences willing to give it a shot. Brie Larson shows us her quick wit and star power as we see her transformation into an action star. Though the latest addition to the MCU has some flaws, specifically in the 3rd act during a CGI infused action sequence against an entire space fleet, CM wins you over with nostalgic easter eggs, solid action stretches, and some well-placed banter. As it compares to the rest of the MCU, it will likely find itself in the middle of the pack but it might have one of the greatest supporting performances in the franchise with Ben Mendelsohn.",1
1591,"I don´t get the backlash, it seems that people dislike Larsson for some reason and are lashing out against the movie. The movie is good (for superhero movies) my 6 year old kid loved it. Larsson´s performance is ok the movie does not sexualize or exploits her looks... the character is always standing and walks like a Terminator. I loved that it is set in the 90s, the action is non stop, mostly predictable, but also mostly fun. The movie is better than most DC movies and better than Iron Man 3 and Spiderman at least.",1
1592,"Good sci-fi , saddled with good action and great not excellent motion-capture.The Cast was amazing.",1
1593,"The film has a positive balance, despite having several errors along the way.The high note is only in respect to a work that is receiving an avalanche of super negative critics based on pure self opinion very shallow, few are criticizing a movie, but they are demonstrating their uncomfortable with what the work represents, were they revolted with little things related to their fanaticism with this universe.It is worth remembering that the MCU is not the same canonical Universe of the comics, Earth-616, even has a proper number for him, Earth-199999.These are all just complaints from nerds other than maturity at all.",1
1594,"Larson delivers an excellent performance, grounding a complex character with real emotion and her own style of the sardonic  Marvel wit. The script unfolds nicely, using dual timelines as she investigates her own memories to deliver a lot of information without losing momentum. Clark Gregg is, as always, a treasure.",1
1595,I loved the film and the character. Another great superhero film from Marvel.,1
1596,Мне понравился. Хороший фильм о приобретении героем своей силы с юмором и в общем каноне киновселенной.,1
1597,"I don't get it. I saw none of the reviews until after I saw the movie, and I don't understand the degree of negativity. Could Larson have been more dynamic? Absolutely. So could 75% of other MCU lead characters. Could they have slowed the pace and shown more of the evolution of her powers? Yes. But as a whole this is still a fun and exciting entry into the Marvel Universe. Anyone that says it ranks at the bottom of the MCU canon has some other agenda. Everything from Marvel is fun. And Captain Marvel is better than average for MCU offerings. Not as good as Ragnarok or most of the Spiderman movies. A whole order of magnitude better than any of the old X-Men flicks. Not as good as GotG, but better than GotG II. It is totally worth your time, and is an essential plot bridge to End Game.",1
1598,"Seen the film twice. And was just diaappointed by how people in general rated a film 0? While critics to be fair, the lowest was like a 39 (3.9) and it just 1 review. Rating this a 10 to boost things up, because it deserves so much more than the hate it is getting. Its not a perfect film. It never was. But it deserves to be treated fairly. Can we just enjoy what we deserve to enjoy? Celebrate what we have to celebrate and just be a peaceful community?",1
1599,"I wasn't initially sold by the trailer and I had my reservations when it started but Captain Marvel won me over. I enjoyed it, it's funny and thoroughly entertaining and a must see for Marvel fans. There are not enough superhero films with a female lead and the ones we do have are, let's be honest, a bit rubbish. I mean Elektra and Catwoman, come on that cannot be the best they can do. Also the fact that we haven't gotten a Black Widow solo movie yet is borderline insulting at this point but apparently there is one in development so there's still hope. It wasn't until Wonder Woman 2017 that it looked like it was possible to have a female superhero movie that wasn't just a joke. I'm not saying Wonder Woman was a masterpiece, it had it's share of problems but it was a definite step in the right direction. Now in 2019 Captain Marvel is another giant step in the right direction.It's the 1990s and we first meet Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) with her powers so no 40 minute wasting time with the hero gets powers and figures out how to use them origin thing. She unexpectedly finds herself on earth during a galactic war between two alien races. It's set before most of the other Avenger movies so you know what that means, a younger CGI version of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). Admittedly this has looked a bit dodgy in the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Antman and the Wasp but for Captain Marvel it's not looking too bad. Also starring Jude Law, Annette Bening and Ben Mendelsohn so a good cast all round. It has a great balance between action and comedy, a perfect precursor to keep us going until Endgame. Brie Larson really was a great casting choice for Captain Marvel. No you don't have to love it, like most superhero movies it isn't perfect but as long as you can buy into the story you should enjoy the ride. It set up the story well and followed its own rules, it did take some time to win me over but Brie Larson had me practically cheering her on by the end. My expectations were not high and we all know how misleading trailers can be but it certainly exceeded them. If you're part of the MCU fanbase then I'm sure you were all in the cinema opening night and don't need me or anyone else to tell you to see it. For anyone on the fence or if you find yourself being swayed by the wave of online trolls and negative reviews do yourself a big favour, ignore all that and go see it for yourself. Highly recommended.",1
1600,"OK, Firstly I would like to say that I went into this movie with low to medium expectations. I am a huge fan of the MCU and was very interested with how Captain Marvel would fit into it all. I did not particularly like the look of the movie based on the trailers nor was I a fan of Brie Larson. There has been so much internet talk on feminist agendas, SJW etc etc. That is why I was so pleasantly surprised with this movie. I really liked it and believe it is a worthy addition to the MCU. I thought LARSON was great and I loved the easter eggs and link ups to the rest of the MCU. A lot of people are complaining about certain things which I wont specify due to spoilers, but I think they are over reacting and I still think it all fits justifiably.The de-aging CGI work on Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg was phenomenal, you honestly just forgot they had done it. Probably the biggest surprise and standout for me was Ben Mendelsoh, he was so good in this and you could tell he just loved playing the role.The humor was good, nothing too drastically different from any other marvel movie. Some common complaints are that the humor was bad, but I think it was dry humor so went over some peoples heads maybe. It certainly wasn't silly joke heavy like Thor Ragnarok. If you are a fan of the MCU then I think you will like this movie. It is not the best MCU movie, but it is certainly up there, I want to say top 5, but I think being honest it would be more top 10.For those worried about feminist agendas and SJW pandering....You can stop worrying..There really isn't anything like that. There was a 90's song playing to a fight scene which was probably the cringiest part for me, but ultimately the most it touches on is about the character, Carol Danvers and her struggles as a woman trying to work her way into the air force. Its not feminist agendas, it is just the reality of that sort of thing, especially in the 90's. (actually that part was set in the 80's, 1989).The post credit scenes and the Stan lee tributes are worth admission alone. I am looking forward to watching it again as soon as possible.",1
1601,"Movie is great, bunch of virgins giving bad reviews. Brie Larson is really hot, especially when she screams at the Skrulls. There was not much feminist SJW bull in the movie like i'd expect.",1
1602,"Brie Larson does great as Captain Marvel. She succeeds in combining superior power with believable humanity. Something that is harder than it seems. Samuel L. Jackson (Fury) is awesome as always, especially with the cat. And good to see Clark Gregg (Coulson) in action again.",1
1603,"Pretty good. Over the top, but they were going for a 90's feel after all. Nowhere near as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be, I guess everyone is still upset about the whole ""white guys"" thing. Definitely not in the top 3 MCU movies, but nowhere near the bottom 3.",1
1604,This is a fun move that does an excellent job of bringing some of the final pieces around and ready for End Game. This is not the masterpiece Black Panther was but not a tank either. Visuals are great the pace was good. I don't really care if it stuck to comic book meta because if I did i would just read the comic.,1
1605,"Had a great time in this movie, and I'm even more stoked for Endgame now than I was before.",1
1606,"After my fourth viewing, I still love this movie!  It shows Marvel's continued commitment to making movies for a diverse crowd that still brings in the big bucks! It's also a lesson to all of us to not pay too much attention to internet trolls who hate on this, and anything that threatens their world view. If you like Marvel movies you'll love this. If you're new to Marvel movies this is a great place to jump on. The characters are great, the performances are fantastic, especially Brie Larson and Samual L Jackson's chemistry.",1
1607,"Let me start with the bad. Fury feels completely out of character. After the first act he can pretty much be taken out completely. His character is really only there to bind the rest of the MCU together. The whole thing related to how he lost his eye... I wanted to give this movie a Zero. I feel so betrayed by the writers, but ignoring Fury, and the small mishaps, this movie is Actually pretty good. The lead feels out of place almost. She tried to do what works in other super-hero comics/movies rather than own it herself. She makes half baked attempts at quips mid-fight that mostly just leave me wishing they were taken out. This is not Deadpool. This is not Iron man. This is not Spider-man. I felt the comedy that the lead character had was pretty empty. That said, I felt she did a fantastic job As capt Marvel. The character itself has such a wide range of feelings throughout. She had some misses, but enough hits to make up for it. Did she Embody the role of Capt Marvel? Well, no. But she did do a Good enough job. Only other thing I really did not like, was the Kree. Kree find guns as a coward's weapon. We see this materialized in Agents of Shield even. Kree Mock humans for using guns literally all the time... but in this movie... guess what? Kree use guns. like a lot of guns. Feels like a mishap in the writing more than anything, which, again, makes me pretty annoyed with the writers. Are the writers Disney hires even fans of the nerd universe they are writing In? Apart from those, The Scrull were Amazing. The mid-movie twists were Very, Very good, and true to the universe. The Comedy was Mostly spot on, and I did Not like Ragnarok because they threw literally everything at the viewers hoping Something would land. The action was good, albeit the ending climatic fight Was a little short. I would Love to see more of Capt Marvel and her journey, pre Endgame. In short, was the movie the greatest MCU movie made? No. Was it the greatest single hero MCU hero? Well, no. Was it the worst? Definitely not. It is a Solid Entry into the MCU and I welcome it. However, they did mess up an established story of one of the infinity stones and I now need answers. lots of answers. How did it get there? Why did it get there? like what do you mean?!?!",1
1608,"It was good! Not my fav MCU film, but I thought Brie handled the role well! Awesome visuals as well, and loved the Tesseract tie-in",1
1609,"has a lot of the typical mcu movie problems (flat lighting, boring color scheme, dull action) but it's really fun and goose the cat is a legend and deserves his own movie",1
1610,"Put aside everything outside of the film(politics nor people getting offended or whatever), the movie simply rocked.Brie Larson played the brute warrior woman very well, but once it comes time to emote, she plays that well too.Sam Jackson meanwhile, is a God. Just the slightest change in his attitude in acting, and we actually have a very convincing younger, less jaded Fury.Action sequences were restricted at the beginning, but when it starts blowing up to grand scale it totally did.CGI was top notch. Within 5 minutes of same Jackson appearing on screen I completely forgot that they de-aged him, it was just so natural (Coulson alittle less so though..)There's 90s references, MCU Easter eggs, Stan Lee, awesome super powers, CAT!There's everything to love here.",1
1611,"A decent addition to the MCU with great characters (including Danvers herself). Some issues with the action and the ending was a little flat in some aspects, but otherwise something any unbiased MCU fan should enjoy.",1
1612,"Really great movie.  I saw it twice opening weekend.  Great exciting movie to get you excited for Endgame.  Cinematography, editing, and visual effects were amazing",1
1613,"It’s fresh, fun and actually entertaining. With a believable script and stellar acting from Larson and Jackson, we feel a strong sense of empathy for the characters and really root for them towards the end. Yes, the editing is choppy in parts, but that’s really the extent of its flaws. Unfortunately, many of the low reviews are coming from (men) who believe the movie is pushing it’s ‘feminist agenda’ too hard. Who knew a movie with a female lead could automatically be labelled ‘feminist’, and simply hated for that reason only. I highly recommend, would see again.",1
1614,One of the best Marvel movies. Awful lot of trolls on these reviews that are just spewing nonsense,1
1615,"The people on this site have shocked me with what is obviously a sexist agenda. This movie does not deserve anywhere near as low a score as it got. Was it a great movie? No. But it was very entertaining, and if you didn't go into it with some preconceived notion that the ""political"" agenda was going to ""ruin"" your film, then it was actually not obtrusive at all.It's pretty obvious where the hate for this film comes from.",1
1616,I saw this last night which was the first night it was available.  I really liked it.  It had great action scenes. and the characters played very well off each other...and Goose!,1
1617,IT'S NOT A BAD MOVIE ITS A GOOD MOVIE...You haters are losing important details before Avengers: Endgame...,1
1618,"Don't trust the online reviews, too many trolls. CM was a solid movie and better than the bottom of the MCU. Better than Antman, Thor 2, Iron man 2, etc. Brie Larson does a compelling lead and the movie was refreshing. It was different from most origin stories. While the movie has subtle and low key political points, they're not in your face and they make sense. As of this writing, it's smashing out the box office. Though facts don't matter much to the type of trolls that are troll bombing it.",1
1619,"Hands down the best superhero movie I've seen in quite some time, excellent in every regard -- well written, well acted, and no overreliance on action or special effects gimmickry to carry the story. Brie Larson seamlessly steps into the role of superhero, capably supported by a cast of colorful supporting players who add humor, intrigue and warmth to a well-constructed narrative. Frankly, I don't care how well or how poorly this offering fits into the larger MCU mythology or the overall marketing strategy of the franchise; I judge a film on its individual merits, and, on this score, the picture succeeds brilliantly on every front. ""Captain Marvel"" does what a superhero movie should -- entertain, inspire and leave viewers feel as though they've gotten their money's worth from the theatrical experience.",1
1620,"I love it! This move connect drama, action, and comedy really fluentlyBut it's really speedy in montage and plot There wasn't any time to analysis anything.. but that's okay",1
1621,This movie has a cat named Goose! Also- lasers and crap!!!  BOOM. BAM. It's fun! everybody chill the hell out.,1
1622,"I'd actually been looking forward to this film for years, especially once I found out that Brie Larson (my absolute favorite actress working today) was cast in the titular role, and man, she did not disappoint! She was the perfect choice as far as I'm concerned, as she brought just the right emotion, confidence, wits, and so much more to the character! Her powers and origin story are beyond impressive, and I found myself cheering for her from start to finish! Some other returning MCU characters, such as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson, etc. also made this all the more fun to watch. Furthermore, there's something here for just about everybody to enjoy, but 90s kids such as myself ought to really appreciate the soundtrack and references from the era throughout! Overall, this is undoubtedly another solid entry in the MCU, and more than lives up to the expectations it had with being the first female-lead MCU film thanks to the light-hearted and humorous fun we've come to expect from most MCU films, but most of all thanks to Brie Larson's all-around awesome performance and charisma!",1
1623,I really liked the movie but I know a lot of people hated it. I mean it was soooo much better than green lantern even if u hated it.,1
1624,This movie does reach higher further and faster in all the positive ways from Larson’s performance or the delight which is goose,1
1625,"Great story, Brie fits perfectly as the stoic yet funny Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel and the fighting scenes were pretty awesome.",1
1626,This was one of the best hero movies i ever seen. Dont believe in the bad reviews. the movie was great. Go and see it right now!!,1
1627,"I found Captain Marvel to be a much better film than most people are giving it credit for. It’s one of the funnier Marvel films in recent memory, and while it is a fairly typical origin story there were a few twists along the way that I quite liked. The action was also solid and I think it sets Carol up well for the big role she will inevitably have in Avengers: Endgame. I thouroughly enjoyed it.",1
1628,"This movie is simply good. Nice plot, great humour. Taking its time to develop the characters, not focused on violence over the actual weight of what's happening as other Marvel movies tend to do. Relatable. As a movie I would honestly give it a 8/10 because it still is a superhero ""burger"" movie, not Casablanca. But seeing the hateful comments with people giving lowest possible score, I am adding for balance. Guys, just let us have some fun too. Smile! ;)",1
1629,"Fun, good action, Brie did fine. The supporting cast were great. Some parts felt a little forced. Definitely doesn’t deserve the hate it’s getting.",1
1630,"A major character (an obvious one) creates the MCU just like how Scrat created the whole GALAXY in the Ice Age Movies. How bloody nuts is that?!?Onto the review.As the long wait to Avengers Endgame is coming to an end,here's a movie about a Female Superhero that no one's ever heard of before that the fans of the “acclaimed” Glass and Mortal Engines are complaining about because they have nothing productive to do. And you know what? In a way,I have to thank the fan outrage for this one (A LOT). If it wasn't for them,I wouldn't be as excited as I was for a movie like Captain Marvel.But we're not here for the millionth negative hack review. You want to know if the movie's good or bad. For most of it,I can’t say it was bad,that's for sure,but just “Cool”. Like,30% Good,30% Bad and 40% Campy as hell.The script has nothing new to tell for a Female-led movie,but there's enough secondary material that makes it justifiable: A message about Girl Power that blows the “female movies with a message about the power of Love” out of the water,an interesting twist for the Skrulls (the main baddies of the movie) that makes them charismatic villains,and all the 90's campiness that's basically the humor part of the movie (or,for most of it,at last).Sure,Brie Larson smiles in the movie,but she doesn’t deliver much. Yeah,I liked her performance,but it was in service of a strange script,while Samuel L. Jackson and Goose The Cat were the better characters in here. And hey,the kids were bearable this time. (Come to think of it,there’s so much material to make me tear apart A Wrinkle In Time here!)The Blockbuster scene is easily the best part in here,and it'll sure be for every movie lover. Pinar Toprak's score is better than I expected it to be (speaking of the orchestra),but it's sometimes a Thor Ragnarok clone with the whole Synthy vibes and classic beats.Nothing special about the VFX and Production Design. They're just fine,that's all.Although the use of 3D was fantastic. Visually speaking,when Carol Danvers gets her powers is just as great as the Venom Vs. Riot CG Pan-around from Venom (2018),or maybe I’m just a sucker for visual slow motion greatness…To top it all,there’s a Stan Lee tribute that is so gut-wrenching,I heard someone almost cried in the theater. (Tears of a true woman/man)But still,this movie has problems (who would’ve guessed…). For starters,the story isn’t really that interesting (aside the secondary material),since it’s the whole “woman on the journey of self-discovery” thing again. Sometimes the fanservice is unnecessary (like when they explain how Fury lost an eye. We saw that coming MILES away when the cat was announced to be part of this movie) and again,Brie Larson giving it her all for uninteresting character development. And,this isn’t part of the movie,but the fanservice it got pre-release (and post) was toxic as hell. Jesus,not even something like Star Wars The Last Jedi can top this level of hate (but it makes way for an extra point,so thank you haters). In the end,Captain Marvel feels like the Birthday Cake that has nothing delicious on top,but that on the middle and end of it,has enough cream and chocolate to make it a Cool tie at the movies. Catch it in IMAX 3D if you can.P.S. The mid-credits sequence is destined to blow minds all over the world. Stick until that and not the post-credits one.",1
1631,"I took my fiancé to Captain Marvel yesterday at AMC Riverpark Square. I was bummed there wasn't an IMAX 3D version, as I had to pick between Dolby Cinema, IMAX, or 3D. We went with the IMAX showing, mainly cause the other versions were mostly sold out.Overall, I thought it was a decent entry into the Marvel Universe. Despite all the pre-release hubbub, I found it wasn't that bad. Since it's set in the 90's before all the other Marvel films, they were able to build an origin story without worrying much of the pre-built universe. You're introduced to a new alien race called the Skrull and also get a better look at the Kree in this film (previously seen in Guardians of the Galaxy). The storyline was somewhat predictable and I wish they spent more time showing some of Ronan the Accuser in earlier years. If you're going to bring a bad-ass villain back, he should play a bigger role, rather than 5mins of screen time to fill in story plot.I think Brie Larson as Captain Marvel will be a good addition to the Avengers in Endgame and interested in seeing how they build her character in Phase 4 of the Marvel Universe. Also, the film gives some backstory to characters like Nick Fury and Agent Coulson which was cool. The special effects are on par with what you'd expect with any Marvel film. Soundtrack was mediocre. For being set in the 90's, there was plenty of good songs they could've picked from, but I won't be buying this soundtrack anytime soon. They also incorporate other 90's nostalgia with things like Blockbuster, Radio Shack, pagers, band tshirts like Nine Inch Nails, and a web cafe seen where Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) uses Alta Vista as a search engine. There's also a shout out to The Fresh Prince.Worth seeing on the big screen? Sure. Was it the best Marvel movie ever? Not really. Definitely worth seeing before Avengers: Endgame as I assume Captain Marvel will play a decent size role in taking on Thanos.",1
1632,"Что ж, очередной фильм от Марвел, про девушку супер героя, признаться честно фильм местами скучноват, экшн сцен маловато, история ГГ мыльная, однако для полной картины лора вселенной, достаточно, хотя все равно есть некоторые недосказанности, но бог с ним, фильм мне понравился, саундтрек очень приятный, поэтому фильмец думаю заслуживает твердой семерочки",1
1634,"The movie was great. But Is it strange that Captain Marvel had more user reviews than Infinity War? Infinity War had 2,862 user reviews while Captain Marvel has 3,471 user reviews. Could the trolls just back off and let us enjoy the movie?",1
1635,"Captain Marvel is about 50% great and 50% terrible. When it’s firing on all cylinders, I’m beside myself with just how much of a comic book this movie looks and feels like. I say this as a lifelong comic reader who has read multiple thousands of comics in my life. But when Captain Marvel ISN’T firing, it’s boring, confusing, goofy, and BEGGING you to make excuses for it.Anyone who says this film is a 9 or a 10 has an agenda. Flat out. I could maybe see someone saying this is an 8 if they were moved by the representation, or something. But in the end, this is a “7” or below affair. I was bored at many points, and no movie can be “good” and have any points of boredom in it.",1
1636,"I personally thought this was one of the better Marvel movies as of late. Samuel L. Jackson's performance and character more than make up for the lackluster acting and character of Brie Larson in the titular role. The origin story is well made and ties up a lot of plot holes that everyone was wondering. The action sequences are well thought out as well. Unfortunately, the villains are also very lackluster (despite one) and this makes the fight sequences significantly less exciting. Hopefully Captain Marvel is a better character in the next Avengers movie.",1
1637,"There is practically no politics in this movie. Anybody who says it is sjw propaganda like star wars didn't watch the movie or is lying.The problem with this movie is the same as supermam:too much of a powerful character. Captain Marvel was never a interesting character that's why nobody knows her, is has nothing to do with politics.",1
1638,"Ignore the wannabe haters and watch this movie for what it is. A fun MCU flick. 10/10, would watch again.",1
1639,"Enjoyed the film as did my two children, really not sure what the red reviews are for as the film is enjoyable and Brie Larson is great in the lead role.  Sam Jackson is as usual great.",1
1640,Great origin movie that isn't as traditional as the trailer may seem. It will be very interesting to see what they do with the character in the future MCU films.,1
1641,"This is the Feminist Super Hero movie we needed at this moment in time. Brie Larson as Carol Danvers or Ver is at home as a badass superpower woman that doesn't want to be controlled or told she can't do something. Samuel L. Jackson is Nick Fury and vice versa. And get to know a lot about Nick Fury in this one. Ben Mendelsohn is great as Talos, the antagonist for the first half. I like the story. I love how the audience is learning about Carol Danvers as Carol is learning about herself at the same time. The acting is solid across the board. The action is great. The humor is really good. The best performance of a ginger cat on screen with Goose. Cat lovers will love this movie. I love Captain Marvel. Saw it twice and enjoyed it both times. I would say this is a solid 8 out of 10. But since the man-babies really don't like the truth that Brie Larson spoke about the film and media journalism industry being dominated by mostly cishet white man, they are review bombing this movie because they have nothing better to do. So I am giving this a 10 out of 10 just to troll them. But I do recommend everyone check the movie. Go see it. It is worth your time.",1
1642,"It's a fun movie. It has some plot holes, but also some nice twists and a few touching moments. Thankfully, it doesn't have so many jokes as other recent Marvel movies (e.g. Thor Ragnarok), which is actually welcome. For me, it's on the ""good"" side of the genre's spectrum.",1
1643,"Plot wasn't perfect but if you consider how much they covered in the time and had so many memorable moments and concepts, I did love it.",1
1644,"Its great but it missed something, jokes werent landed well in places and when the best thing is a mostly CGI’d cat then you know theres an issue. I think the producer was trying to cover up flaws in the film by dropping the cat in for cheap laughs. Lashana Lynch was great, a nice bit of emotional acting as Maria Rambeau.",1
1645,"Overall, I enjoyed Captain Marvel.  The flow has a nice twist in action.  The characters were great.  The story was intelligent and realistic.  I only saw one hiccup in the story which involves the Kree fleet arriving at Earth, but that is the only hiccup I saw.  It gives a nice back story to a few characters and events, leaving me wondering if Captain Marvel 2 will be the events that lead up to Guardians of the Galaxy.I have no idea what the negative reviews are about.  You have to be wanting to hate this movie to hate it.",1
1646,"Dont believe the trolls giving this movie a 0 and claiming they were bored/fell asleep.  100% MCU loremaster here, and this movie beautifully subverted the expected tropes while simultaneously staying true to the proven Marvel formula.  Great chemistry between SLJ and basically everyone, despite the reports of a flat performance, Brie (particularly opposite Jude Law) did very well.  As for the so-called feminist narrative, it was far more organically presented than in sister heroine flick Wonder Woman, who's ""oops you underestimated me because Im a woman"" grew stale quickly, but in Captain Marvel I find myself rooting for Carol purely based of her own character and arc, and the fact that shes a woman fits naturally in why she is where and who she is.  Special effects were a huge step up from Infinity War, and I have very high hopes for Endgme.",1
1647,"Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews.  This movie is the perfect setup for Avengers Endgame and also a great movie as a stand alone project which introduces a new character to the marvel universe.  Some great action, good acting, and a empowering feel good movie for all ages.",1
1648,"Got to be honest, this movie is good, i´m a marvel fan, soo i´ve been waiting for this movie for a few time now, and it didn´t dissapoint me, I expected big vfx, and they were as good as it gets. Brie Larson entries in this universe with a bang, bringing such good job as Carol Danvers, some plot twists, good acting by the cast, and one of the best visual effects i´ve ever seen in movies, it makes Captain Marvel a good and enjoyable movie to watch in any time. Maybe i´m saying this because i´ve been a fan of Marvel for years now, but I believe It´s not, the movie is just amazing, being honest, not the best movie of Marvel, but still one of the best, Marvel didn´t dissapoint and brings us a new strong female hero, on the best way. She will return in Avengers Endgame, and i can´t wait to see her again, and kick Thanos ass. I liked this movie, it delivers the quality of Marvel Universe, and the post credits scene leave us with hope, more i won´t say, just goo and see the movie.",1
1649,"After the catastrophic events of Avengers: Infinity War (and the pleasingly droll interlude of Ant-Man and the Wasp), Marvel Studios take us back to the 90s with Captain Marvel, starring Oscar winner Brie Larson as the titular intergalactic hero. It’s a film that certainly has the weight of responsibility firmly on its shoulders; not only is it an origin story packed within the developed third phase of its universe, it acts as both a link to the past (a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson is unnervingly convincing) and a bridge to what is undeniably Marvel’s big event of the year, Avengers: Endgame.Captain Marvel is entertaining enough; the script may be inconsistent, yet it hits a number of laughs and the cast, from Jude Law to Annette Bening, are a spunky ensemble that bring a bright earnestness to the film. It’s a fairly standard origin story that makes unapologetic use of Marvel’s signature formula, often with results that, whilst usually fun, can’t help but feel slightly circumspect and contained. We watch as Larson’s Vers (as she is known on her supposed home planet of Kree) crashes on Earth, her memories of her past fragmented and her identity thoroughly muddled. This is much like the film’s narrative itself which feels largely scattershot, jumping through flashbacks and glossing quickly over plot points with nonchalance. That being said, the movie is very entertaining, an odd tonal balance of Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-esque retro humour and the bombastic action stakes of Star Wars. Without a doubt, it’s fun, with charm obscuring the more clunky moments in the writing.Captain Marvel, of course, relies strongly on Brie Larson’s leading performance. Larson is undoubtably a terrific actress who commits wholeheartedly to the role, making the best of the disappointingly little that is given to her. In the end, whilst the scope of her powers are cause for sensation, the character herself feels lost in her own film, attempts at pathos underdone and most of the best moments going to other characters.The extended players stand out far more, with marvellous turns by Ben Mendelsohn and Lashana Lynch and a star-studded performance from a certain feline. The cast (even Larson to an extent) are the film’s saving grace, carrying the film with a jubilance that can’t help but bring a smile to the face.Other aspects of the film also shine; the visual effects are polished and a distinctly 90s jukebox soundtrack works well. Far from spending its time in space, most of the film is grounded on good ol’ Planet Earth, packed full of satisfying nods to the period.All said, Captain Marvel is a tricky film; it can’t help but feel like a stepping stone to the next point of the overall narrative of the universe, a safe and unambitious adventure muddied in franchise building. For me, however, the quirky humour, visual thrills and undeniable sense of fun are enough to give Captain Marvel a watch.",1
1650,"Incredible movie! This movie packs everything you've come to expect from MCU! It's a fun, exciting, inspiring, funny, witty, clever, suspenseful, full of action edge of your seat ride from beginning to end. Bravo MCU!",1
1651,"It was by far my new favorite Marvel movie. Brie Larson was inspiring, she reached the inner fighter within and showed the world how us girls can get back up without the massive makeup and skimpy outfits. We don't always have to have the bright happy girlie attitude. This is one of those movies you gotta watch again and again because you missed something. I'm excited for End Game after seeing this movie. Captain Marvel answered so many questions about the Marvel Universe. I left the theater satisfied and craving more. I highly suggest watching this movie multiple times. I am.",1
1652,Great film! Brie Larson at her best! Must see Superhero of this year by far! Thank You Stan Lee! Loved the Marvel Studios logo featuring the faces of Stan Lee!,1
1653,"a very good movie to a very good actress and a powerful heroe, marvel never fails",1
1654,"Good movie,intiresting twist with scruls . Samuel Jackson is great in this movie",1
1655,"Не понимаю, почему люди так хейтя этот фильм, по-моему он превосходный. Бри Ларсон хорошо играет своего персонажа, не скучный экшн, прекрасный кот, не банальный сюжет и конечно же Ник Фьюри. Даже мстителей показали. Я не жалею, что сходил на этот фильм.",1
1656,"I have no idea why everyone is so down on this movie. It was GREAT! Action, comedy, compassion...everything that makes a Marvel movie special. The haters gotta hate. Hopefully enough Marvel lovers will chime in and drown out the haters. A fun, fast paced, action packed movie with twists and great acting. GO SEE IT!!!",1
1657,Found it to be a very enjoyable super hero movie. Only thing that bugged me was Marvel's helmet.,1
1658,I liked it. Plain and simple. Sure it wasn't the best in the MCU but it was quite enjoyable. I don't care about the haters,1
1659,"I went into this movie expecting it to be on par with the first Thor and Captain America movies, but never expected it to be better than Iron Man and The Avengers. I loved every aspect of this film. The humor was constant and Brie Larson really brought Captain Marvel to life for me. She has so many endearing moments and her confidence rivals Robert Downey Jr's interpretation of Tony Stark. This is the best 90s Sam Jackson movie since Jackie Brown. Ben Mendelssohn is easily the most compelling adversary we've had in a long time and the way they tied this movie into the collective gave me GOOSE bumps. Jude Law is also a ton of fun and kudos to Lashana Lynch. What's amazing about the MCU is that you could watch Captain America The First Avenger first, then Captain Marvel, and then go into Iron Man and you get to experience the complete history of the Tesseract and it almost makes the entire MCU better, and it begins the journey towards Infinity War with the Infinity Stones with such grace. I will probably see this movie five times in the theater (thanks AMC!) because wow, what a beautiful cinematic experience. If I had a daughter, this would be the movie poster I'd want her to have on her wall. 9/10",1
1660,"I gave the movie 8 out of 10 because I really wasn't disappointed in my expectations, and in fact some were exceeded. I expected it to be a little heavy on social more's, and it really wasn't. It came off as natural, and completely did justice to any concerns to the contrary. I felt that Carol coming to terms with herself seemed a little rushed, and could have been done with some more nuance in the plot line, but this really didn't affect my overall enjoyment of the film, especially with respect to it being a full movie presenting as a plot device for an even grander story arc in Avengers: End GameVery hard to be mad at a movie that accomplishes, with astonishing acrobatics, and intergalactic warfare, just that.",1
1661,I don't understand why the comments are so hard. maybe not a masterpiece but certainly not a bad movie.ps:I liked cat.,1
1662,"Good action and good chemistry between Larson and Samuel L. I have say as a guy, Brie is nice to look at on screen, She has especially pretty eyes. What’s funny is there is this little conservative mafia who disagrees with her politics so they’re trashing the movie out of spite. Haha, good luck with that. I’m sure it’s going to make a killing at the box office. Looking forward to seeing her in Avengers endgame, That’s going to be epic and loads of fun.",1
1664,"I was thoroughly entertained. Not the best movie I've ever seen but waaaaaaaaaay better than other audience scores lead me to believe. After a bit of a confusing start, once the narrative cleaned up I sat back & enjoyed the action, humour and heart of this film.",1
1665,"For a Marvel film it's very much middle of the road and simply isn't up to the high level of quality the studio has set. It's not a bad movie per se, but it could have been much better.Pros: Goose the cat steals every scene he's in. And Ben Mendelsohn does a great job! Fury and Capt Marvel also have a good odd couple/buddy cop vibe going for them for the brief time it's shown in the film, which leads me to the cons....Cons: 1) They keep changing up what the film is supposed to be. First it's a duck out of water story, then it's a buddy cop film, then it's something else entirely. The overarching theme changed 3 or 4 times and it feels like the film has multiple first acts. 2) It's predictable now and then so you are stuck waiting for the characters to catch up. 3) They really fumbled the 90s nostalgia--it felt really forced and the music that was selected was misplaced or a poor fit for the scenes they were used in. 4) The audio was poorly mixed--the music is WAY louder than all the other audio in the film for some reason. I thought this was maybe just the theater, but reading reviews online this seems to be a common observation.In conclusion I'd give a 6.5/10, which I'll round up to a 7/10 for the mid-credit scene and Stan Lee cameo and intro. Worth catching once in the theater because it's still a decent popcorn movie and I'm all in with the MCU. However, if you're not a big Marvel fan and/or can catch the mid-credits scene online, then you could probably wait for video. It's not what I would characterize as a ""must see in the theater"" movie along the lines of Thor 2.An actual ""must see in theater"" film is Alita: Battle Angel. Now THAT deserves to be seen in IMAX 3D. Such a beautiful film, and great movie in general.",1
1666,"I had started to become a little disenfranchized with all of the superhero movies lately and was not even interested in seeing this one, but I am super glad that I did. It isn't the same old story and the characters actually depth. I'm glad my friends talked me into going because I loved it.",1
1667,"Isolated this is just another Superhero movie. But for us who like to follow the MCU universe as one big story, this is a great addition with plenty of references to other MCU movies. They have also managed to use the original stories from the Comics in a new and fresh way.",1
1668,"Much better than expected. The trolls slogging this film haven't even seen it. I put it in the top 20-25% of MCU films. It has heart, humor and fun action sequences.",1
1669,"It was awesome, don't listen to all the trolls who didnt even SEE the movie. They wanted to hate it out of the gate without even giving it a chance. Great move. I wish there was more Phil Coulson in it though...his part was small.",1
1670,"This movie needed to answer the question ""who is Captain Marvel?"" for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Franky speaking, the character of Carol Danvers is a mess in the comics. She's had an inconsistent power set, personality, and the details of her origin story have shifted several times. However, a few things have remained consistent. She's a soldier. She's strong. And she's a hero.This movie introduces us to Carol through the well-worn trope of ""lose and regain memories"". This is probably inspired by Uncanny X-Men (see #154, 158, 164, 171) where Carol loses her emotional connection to her own memories. But I believe it helps set the correct tone for Brie Larson's performance:- Her mentor (Yon-Rogg = Jude Law) criticizes her for being too emotional.- The Supreme Intelligence of the Kree is supposed to take the form of ""who we admire most"", but Carol doesn't remember the person shown before her.- Carol expresses that she doesn't know who she is, and is often captivated by photographs or other pieces of her identity throughout the film.This is consistent with the Carol Danvers of the comics, who is usually cold and uncharismatic. However, this would be a poor choice of personality for the namesake of the Marvel franchise, so the movie's central arc is well-chosen: Carol begins as an ""alien"" and becomes ""human"". She starts as a Kree warrior tasked with mercilessly combating the Skrull, but gradually recovers her past and grows compassionate enough to listen to the other side of the story and help the Skrull leader reunite with his family.The movie has strange pacing to further realize this arc, alternating between action sequences and moments of self-discovery. The characters must tell ""details so specific a Skrull could not reproduce them"" about themselves in order to prove their identity. Personal details emerge in the excellent banter between Fury and Danvers. And Carol is confronted with a literal ""box full of memories"" when she finds her long-lost best friend Maria. Seeing Carol go from initially not recognizing Monica to reconnecting with ""Lt. Trouble"" is precisely the sort of development needed to make Carol human.All of this is intended to communicate the character of Carol Danvers, and causes the movie to have a unique texture. The stakes become ""who is Captain Marvel?"" rather than ""will she win?"" It's an unconventional way to tell an origin story, but I felt it was effective.---A few other stray thoughts:- My main criticism of other MCU movies is poor imitation of Joss Whedon's style of comedy (releasing tension falsely). Captain Marvel appropriately uses humorous moments to endear us to the characters.- There were a few lines of dialogue that were too on-the-nose and broke my immersion, but they were brief and forgivable.- I was not convinced by Brie Larson in the trailers, but she captured the essence of Captain Marvel.- Making the Skrull sympathetic was a surprising reversal of expectations.- The choice of music didn't work in a couple spots.- The effects are excellent as usual, but the photon-based powers are particularly impressive.",1
1671,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. I think it's a great character origins movie that explains really well where she comes from and constructs a great character for the future. I loved her strength, because I can appreciate her weakness, she's not only smart, it's sarcastic, she's a normal woman with overpowers, so I think it's awesome!",1
1672,"Not the greatest film in the MCU, but still filled with all the things I like in an MCU film - humour, great action scenes, incredible effects. Has only made the wait for End Game more anticipated.",1
1673,"I would've happily watched that for another hourMy only conplainterested so that (like most origin stories) there was a lot of exposition to get through before we saw her unlock her true strength. Not a real complaint though as it added drama and escilaction. Once the escalation was done though, it felt as though the writers didn't know how to handle such a powerful character. Doesn't matter though, thoroughly enjoyed it and going back for round 2!",1
1674,"I'm really surprised at the overwhelming negative comments. I truly enjoyed this film. Though it does fill some the Marvel cliches (ie. sarcastic hero, troubled past, origin story) it does the job at creating more depth in the MCU. Though I loved the inclusion of 90s tracks, I actually didn't like the original score, it seemed too obvious and over-the-top. Otherwise I think this film hit all the right buttons.",1
1675,"This movie was a lot better than the reviews have been giving it credit for. It might not end up being the most memorable movie in the scheme of things, but it was a LOT of fun and Brie Larson is really satisfyingly badass. In a lot of ways, with its tone, a plot twist or two, and the concurrent flashback storyline, it didn’t feel like a Marvel movie in that very specific paint-by-numbers way that these movies can go. In addition to being set in the 90s, it reminded me a lot of a movie I would’ve seen in the 90s — with its buddy cop tone, cheesy but heartwarming inspirational lines, and the after-school special messages of fairness and friendship — all on that gargantuan Marvel budget.Think Top Gun meets Memento meets Robocop meets... space Buffy?",1
1676,"The story moved a little slow at first, but it quickly found its pace, the new characters were well fleshed out and the action scenes were fantastic. The plot had twists I didn't see coming and was satisfied with. I'd highly recommend to anyone whether a Marvel fan or not.",1
1677,"Just a very enjoyable movie - but nothing exceptional. The acting and characters are what make this movie, it's very fun to see Danvers and Fury interact.",1
1678,"Just a super fun movie with action, humor, great music, and a little something for everyone. Do yourself a favor: kick back with some popcorn and have FUN! Higher, further, faster, baby!",1
1679,"Great origin movie which always start slow, made me want to see more of Captain Marvel. Will defiantly go and see this one again.",1
1680,"First of all, Brie Larson as Captain Marvel is good. In a few scenes, it looked like she was giving it her all in that performance while in others it seemed as if she was only phoning it in. That can be said about a few of the others. Especially Jude Law, who plays Yon-Rog, who I’ve seen in other roles and is captivating in it. But this role just didn’t seem to fit him that well. Really the only person I can say did a good job was Ben Mendelsohn, who plays Talos. Every scene that he’s in he gives it his all and you can easily tell he is comfortable in this role. This has nothing to do with the movie but I just loved Goose the cat. But speaking of Goose when they used a real cat actor it was great but when they switched it out and made him CGI it looked terrible. I feel like they blew their entire budget on different scenes and had to just find a clichéd cat on the internet. I only say this because all of the scenery in every scene is amazing. The cinematography is outstanding in this film. The pacing in this film was weird and just off. The film is two hours and four minutes but it feels like two hours and forty minutes. One thing that bugged me but also I was happy about was all the answers we got for other Marvel movies. This film has plot twists but they are so obvious that even a kid could figure them out before they are revealed. Due to this film taking place in 1995 I feel bad for all the kids who won’t understand the references the movie is making. But the cultured ones like me will get them. Finally, there are two end credits scenes but really just stay for the first one. In the end, Captain Marvel isn’t the worst Marvel movie but it also isn’t the best. I definitely recommend watching in 3D.",1
1681,Feel the need to give this a 10 cuz goddamn these trolls are pissed lol. It wasn't that bad yall are just salty about a woman in a movie.,1
1682,"The movie was actually pretty enjoyable to me, I went in with low expectations because of others reactions to it, but after watching and actually seeing it for myself...gotta say the negative post are definetly reactions to the actresses words/actions for hype around the movie and not the actual movie itself. it doesn't make any plotholes, it's pretty good at pacing, and has some pretty funny moments from the supporting cast. How furys eye got messed up is hilariously simple and less heroic though and I guess if it's a big reveal you wanted to know all mcu it's a minor letdown, maybe? but otherwise it's all pretty good in my opinion.",1
1683,"Genuinely enjoyable yet somewhat underwhelming is the best thing I can say about Captain Marvel. It's a fun addition to the Marvel Universe but it needs to take it's own advice and go ""Higher"" and ""Further"" than what a typical Marvel movie should be these days.",1
1684,"This movie was incredible on just about every front and had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I loved that a lot of things in the Marvel Movie Universe were cleared up (but obviously will refrain from what and how), I loved her character's personality, I loved the designs of the vehicles and uniforms, and I can't wait to see more of her in upcoming Marvel titles. This is my new favorite Marvel movie. Watch this.",1
1685,"Not the best Marvel movie, but far from the worst. There are a lot of fun scenes and some unexpected moments both good and bad. You don't need to see it before Endgame but I wouldn't consider it a waste of time.",1
1686,"I enjoyed the movie. I like the earlier part where she's trying to find her way. Once she becomes super-powered, she has the same problem as Superman, there's no challenge anymore to her battles. I especially enjoyed the supporting roles, Danver's best friend Maria (Lynch), Fury, Talos, and Goose.",1
1687,"Capitana Marvel: 7.5 de 10, no es de las mejores películas del universo marvel pero si es mucho mejor a cómo la estaba describiendo la crítica, no se pierde el dinero yendo a verla además que tiene el abrebocas sobre la próxima película de los vengadores.",1
1688,"I liked most of the MCU movies, but this one was icing on the cake and I've already watched it twice!  I loved the skrulls!!! I was confused to see Carol with the Kree in the ads but when the movie plays out, it makes much more sense.  Loved everything about this movie...the cast, the story, the flerken!",1
1689,"I found that this was a solid MCU movie, and it seems like its receiving a lot of undeserved hate. I don't think that it is in the same league as Thor Ragnarok or Infinity War, but ended up enjoying the Captain Marvel backstory and characters. The best parts were the interactions between Sam Jackson and Brie Larson, and I found myself entertained, laughing, and excited for Endgame. My biggest criticisms would be that I think Brie Larson's delivery was a bit dry at times, and I think that the hand to hand fighting scenes could use a bit of work. Like any Marvel movie, the CGI was really impressive.",1
1690,"Captain Marvel is a fun, thrill-ride of a movie with a charismatic cast and breathtaking visual effects. The fight scenes are exciting and the sci-fi is solid. There are some pacing issues, but that comes with the territory when there are five writers and two directors on a project like this. Ignore the trolls and straw-man arguments who are clutching their pearls over something as simple as a call for diversity in film. If you have kids, take them to see Captain Marvel. You'll have just as much fun as they do.",1
1691,"I had loads of fun! I was expecting to be disappointed, mainly with because I originally wanted a different actress to play Carol Danvers, but Brie Larson really pulled it off! It's funny, touching and overall enjoyable, would watch it again.",1
1692,"another masterpiece of MCU. one of the very important puzzle pieces. the perfect emotion of a carol. A good start for Carol Danvers is one of the most important heroes of the MCU. very strong but not always there for the earth, that's a brilliant idea. comedy that is not excessive but is right for every moment. very good start for the story of a carol danvers.",1
1693,"I saw this movie with my son and we absolutely loved it. Captain Marvel has a brilliant backstory and the story was executed well. There's humor, and action, just like all the other Marvel movies. And the soundtrack is a-m-a-z-i-n-g. I had to fight the urge to sing through the whole movie. Dare I say the soundtrack is better than Guardians of the Galaxy? Yes. I think I do. I'm definitely going for a second viewing this weekend.",1
1694,"Don't believe the negative user reviews. Trolls who said Brie Larson didn't smile enough and swore they wouldn't see the movie are now rating it after not even seeing it.This movie was a lot better than I expected. The chemistry between Carol and Fury was great. It was a lot funnier than I expected too. Ben Mendelsohn's character was a nice surprise. And to those saying she didn't have an arc, I don't know what to say - she had a greater arc than even Captain America in his origin story. Gaining superpowers is not an arc - an inner transformation is. I love Captain America, but Steve Rogers went from a determined, nice guy to a determined nice guy with muscles. She went from a strong-willed person to one beaten down and brainwashed, to one who regains her strength through sheer will and the help of her friends. It was pretty endearing, actually. Also, that cat and the credits! A great setup for Endgame and a new hero.",1
1695,Full disclosure. I was going in to this film with low expectations. I thought this might be the film where the MCU fatigue set in. I was dead wrong. This film is fun and I love the de-aging process for Jackson and Gregg. I enjoyed Larson`s portrayal of Captain Marvel and I`m excited for what she will bring to the MCU as a whole. Mid-Credit scene is almost worth price of admission alone. Loved it. Also the cat is OP,1
1696,"Captain Marvel suffers from many of the pitfalls of a Marvel ""phase one origin"" film. That being said, it is still quite an enjoyable ride with some endearing characters. Brie Larson delivers an admirable performance, especially given the poor writing done for her character (more consistency next time please). The editing could also use some improvement but it was serviceable for the story that the film was trying to tell. Overall, this film feels more like a stepping stone to Endgame than anything else, which is fine. People tend to forget that the original Captain America suffered from many of the same problems but the character was much improved as part of a group (Avengers) and in subsequent films (Winter Soldier, Civil War). This manhunt (pardon the pun) against Captain Marvel needs to stop. It is far from the worst comic book film adaptation (Suicide Squad, fight me) and is definitely not the worst Marvel film (Thor 2: The Dark World, fight me again).",1
1697,"Это лучший фильм, который смотрела за последний год. Фильм не без минусов - все же слишком сильно давили на слезы + вся эта ценность семьи на заднем плане выглядит... не очень. Но тем не менее, это фильм про сильную женщину. В этом фильме играла прекрасная актриса.И молодой Ник Фьюри - это нечто :)Спасибо тебе, капитан Марвел!",1
1698,"As my expectations are often low for Marvel movies, I was agreeably surprised. The main character has an interesting personality in my opinion (really not a consensus) and the movie is mostly her quest to remember...  A bit more emotional expression would have made her more credible though (most probably a director decision and not the fault of the actress). -- The character interactions are good overall, though not as good as other Marvel movies I would say. The main plot (no spoilers) is morally interesting ! --   The introduction (content) was refreshing. The additions to the history of the Marvel characters, including S.H.I.E.L.D., were nice overall; though some pieces were trying too hard to fit. -- Not a grand movie, but quite fine. -- nb: those voting 0 to 3 might reflect on the fact they are rating this movie as worse than The Last Jedi, which had objectively a bad script and serious story holes/issues.  A fair and reasonable critical view could make this movie deserve between 4 to 6.  The negative votes are extreme and demonstrate they were done with an activist attitude so-to-speak.  My friends, which are men around 40 years old, neither super feminists nor anti-feminists, found it OK, not really bad, and would rate it around 6 or 7.5.  User reviews lose their credibility if we vote here so unfairly.  We will need thousands of more fair and reasonable people to vote here.",1
1699,"A seriously fun entry in the MCU.  Jackson and Larson have excellent chemistry, and the plot goes fully unexpected.  Don't listen to the man-babies brigading the reviews; this was a great night at the movies.",1
1700,"Classic Marvel movie! Not below the average or above average. It was a film that couldn't give the exact message it wanted to give, but survived somehow.",1
1701,Really fun movie! Definitely has a 90s action movie feel to it. It’s actually not overly political or a SJW movie like advertised or what people are saying in the reviews. Brie Larson nails Carol’s personality really well. The writing isn’t the strongest compared to other marvel movies but it is a decent orgin movie. I’d place it in the mid tier amongst the other Marvel movies. It’s not Thor Ragnorak but it’s definitly no Thor 2 lol,1
1702,"I admit that the film surprised me a lot, not only did it bring me many feelings of happiness, excitement and curiosity that only Infinite War brought, no matter how much Black Panther is a much better and well built film. Captain Marvel to me is one of the best Marvel films. not being an Infinite War, but rather like a film that is humble and owns a super heroine. (personal opinion of mine.)",1
1703,"Well, before i saw this movie, i didn't checked any of the interviews with Ms. Larson so my experience wasn't affected by feminist views. I enjoyed the film. Sure, it wasn't a big deal, this movie won't be in my top 5 MCU-movies even.The acting was interesting (there were ups-and-downs), the story was okay and the jokes were good too (except few of them - bad writing and compositions).But all of it, it was okay, i had fun while i watched it. This is all that matters for me. :).",1
1704,Another great Marvel movie; which will lead to the last Avenger's End Game movie! The rapport between Captain Marvel and Nick Fury makes it a fun movie to see.,1
1705,"Fun Movie. Well done. As good as any Marvel Entry.  Laid the groundwork.  One of the best Stan Lee Cameos ever. Unless your some bigoted, mental midget ""man"", you'll probably really enjoy this. Not the best MCU film, but certainly a really good one. Brie NAILS it!Sorry Boys",1
1706,Brie Larson played arguably one of the best comic book characters I've ever seen. Her mix of raw power and subtle humor absolutely made the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed Captain Marvel and cannot wait to see what she brings to Avengers: Endgame.,1
1707,"A fun popcorn movie, with good performances, especially by Larson and Jackson, but disappointingly by the numbers. The character, and Larson's portrayal, are great additions to the MCU, and I’m looking forward to more of her. But this outing was good, not great.",1
1708,"Excellent addition to the Marvel cinematic universe. Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson have great chemistry. The world they create for the Kree is actually very intriguing, hopefully, in the sequels, the world is explored more. The 1990s nostalgia is subtle but there, with the hotwiring of a Gameboy to communicate with her superiors, to the throwback to some great songs of the 90s. The Skrull are actually well done in that you thought they would be the villains but they flipped the script to make them seem more misunderstood. I agree that Captain Marvel is overpowered but that's her character, just like Superman is overpowered.  Ben Mendelsohn also does an incredible job as Talos and Annette Bening is also great.",1
1709,"For me the movie was pretty entertaining. The cat was hilarious, Carol (Brie) was just the right amount of funny, and serious. The hours passed without you even noticed. I think this has so many bad reviews because of the people don't wanting to have a female superhero that is better than the current ones.",1
1710,"Это отличный фильм впечатления от которого могут испортить завышенные ожидания. Это, как мне кажется, и случилось со всеми кто ставит ему низкие оценки.",1
1711,"If you've seen the movie, and I mean really seen the movie... You'll know that it's a perfectly adequate Marvel movie, like any other before it. And for that, I give it a 7 like I would give most Marvel movies. Review bombing was expected, nothing to do with the movie just a bunch of ""cats"" showing their fear to the world",1
1712,"Captain Marvel will go down in history as one of the most revolutionary movies of our time. Before I get to my review it needs to be stated that anyone giving Captain Marvel a score of less than 8 simply cant handle the fact that a strong female protagonist is being depicted as someone who doesn't need to rely on some generic male character who is, by default, (by virtue of western society-induced implicit biases, or simply by lazy writing) intellectually and physically superior to any and all female characters. That is a fact. Unfortunately we live in a society so mentally distorted by antiquated patriarchal systems of power that the most entitled and privileged among us are hardwired to react with fury and vindictiveness whenever the mere notion of gender equality is expressed to women and girls who have been told for centuries that they're not good enough. Fortunately, some men such as myself are intellectually advanced and compassionate enough to acknowledge this, and are willing to stand behind women in their fight for justice. Now onto the review!Brie Larson, both as Captain Marvel AND as herself is perhaps the most inspiring character and individual in modern history. She takes all the stereotypes of ""muh femalez are all weak and helpless"" and turns them completely on their head, exposing the denied truth that women are just as strong as their male counterparts. Stereotypes like this are extremely harmful to the emotional well-being of women. Ms. Larson's acting is simply exquisite. I genuinely cried a few times throughout the movie; not just because of how incredible the experience was from beginning to end, but because I became so emotionally overwhelmed by the realization that FINALLY women are being represented as the strong, independent forces of nature that every single one of them are, and this is FINALLY becoming mainstream. We are at a turning point in history, and I can think of no better way to encapsulate this revolution of gender equality than the release of Captain Marvel. I'm not ashamed to admit that I am holding back tears as I write this, as I cannot help thinking of all the struggles endured by women that have finally led us to this point. So to anyone still considering whether to watch this movie: do it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to only pay $10-15 to take part in a historic moment. At the very least, your contribution will incentivize other Hollywood producers to follow our lead in fighting for freedom and justice. ""Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.""Oh, and to whoever wants to downvote my review: you're just confirming the angry white male stereotype, but at least it is a valid stereotype.",1
1713,"Captain MarvelPros: Carol is a bada$$, lots of cool Marvel nerd references, favorite Stan Lee cameo (and anyone who looks closely and knows where my fandom lies will know why). The 90’s nostalgia was refreshing (as I’m getting a little tired of 80’s nostalgia) without being overdone. The bait and switch in terms of the plot sold me. Really dug some of the ways it tied into the broader MCU history. A really cool variety of action sequences. If you like action, it has a little bit of everything.Cons: Carol is a bada$$, but I don’t feel like she got a real character arc to get her there. I wanted a little bit more of her backstory to really cement her character. I think I understand why she was presented the way she was within the context of the overall story, but I just wanted a little more. While I dug some of the ways it ties into MCU history, there were other ways I thought were kinda dumb. (Sidenote: While not a knock against the film itself, I’m still not sold on how she is being placed in the MCU timeline. I guess I’ll see how I feel after Endgame).Special Nerdy Pro/Con Mix: There was a very particular thing I wanted from this movie that was given to me, just not in the form I wanted it. However, it did leave the door open for giving it to me in a later film.Overall: While Brie Larson works well with what she was given and the character choices make sense in terms of the story, I really didn’t connect to Carol as a character. I’m also hoping her introduction at this stage doesn’t amount to a sort of Deus ex machina going into Endgame. That being said, the story is great, the action is great, Nick Fury (Sam Jackson) is great, Coulson’s (Clark Gregg) return is great, Goose the cat(?) is great, the Skrulls are great, all the comic book nerd references are great. All in all, pretty great.Grade: B+(P.S. Stan Lee fans, try not to cry as the film opens).",1
1714,"It’s a real shame that this film is targeted by organized, mentally troubled trolls. It’s a feel-good, fun, exciting superhero movie",1
1715,"It's good ! ignore the haters,This one is filled with fun,action and visual thrills!! Screenplay is engaging , could have been great; still worth a watch it in big screen!! #brielarson done fine job as #captainmarvel & Samuel L. Jackson as #nickfury is cool and #goose the cat is show stealer !Don't miss the post credit scene to #avengersendgame",1
1716,"All the negative reviews are disgusting. Full of hate and non-sense arguments trying to convince people that this movie sucks when it doesn't. It may not be the best MCU movie, but it's fresh and it shares a new point of view of a new different kind of movie we've never seen on screen before. You're full of hate and you are all pressed by the fact that a woman is now leading the MCU with the others. Enjoy the movie and let the hate behind.",1
1717,"Nice tribute to Stan at the start.The movie was set in the 90s but it didn't really feel like the 90s except the soundtrack which was all 90s pop.No strong villain.As much as I enjoyed the portrayal of the Kree I though they went completely out of character with the Skrull, it kind of took me out of the movie.Nick Fury was comic relief for pretty much the entire movie... there was a weird trying to be funny tone to the whole movie that never felt right.Extremely lame Nick Fury reveal.Good action, good special effects.Not a great Marvel movie, but not a bad one either.",1
1718,"Although getting off to a rough start, Captain Marvel really found its footing to cement itself into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The choppiness of the first half left me disappointed, but once the film took off it was an exhilirating and enjoyable ride. Carol Danvers, played by Brie Larson, truly made the heart of the movie. This wasn't a typical superhero origin film where the title character learns to grow into a new version of herself, but rather has to come back to her roots and discover what made her a hero in the first place. Her cool and calm demeanor was refreshing, while her more soft and humorous moments showed Carol's complexity and Brie's talent. With Carol Danvers in the lead, other parts of the film that were lacking were much easier to overlook. Other characters such as Fury and Rambeau also did a fantastic job at supporting the main character while being strong on their own. Overall, the film did not meet my high expectations for being released this late in the MCU, but the bold and inspiring title character and a strong second half won me over.",1
1719,"I've seen Captain Marvel twice now, and I actually liked it better on second viewing.  I went into the movie very apprehensive that the studio would blow it and make huge mistakes with this movie given the historic opportunity, like DC did by cramming too much mess into Batman vs. Superman (very obvious that movie was ""made by committee"" instead of the actual director).  But I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out to be a solid entry into the Marvel movie universe.  Fun and entertaining, Brie Larson's character is at her best and most enjoyable self when engaging in Carol's snarky sarcastic side.  CGI & special effects are excellent, actually better than many CGI scenes in Black Panther.  The only real complaints I had are:  The color of Danver's green ""Kree military"" suit.  I just don't like that color, it's flat.The de-aging CGI on Samuel L. Jackson was fantastic, but on Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson it was HORRIBLE.  His face looked plastic and fake, bad enough it almost took me out of the movie on first viewing.Bad science regarding an impromptu ""retrofit"" of an earth jet craft to make it not only worthy of space travel, but escape velocity?!  Come on that's like upgrading a Cessna to go into space.  Other than these relatively minor problems, it was a solid, fun movie!  Very satisfying to finally see Captain Marvel realize her full potential and BREAK LOOSE.  Go see it and judge for yourself!  Solid 8 out of 10 stars for me.",1
1720,"The movie was awesome from the beginning to the end, visual effects were really good. It felt a little realistic.",1
1721,"Looks like a new franchise is born, judging by the Easter eggs scattered throughout this film and the money it's making. I thought the movie was fine, and Brie Larsen extraordinary. These movies are what they are, and are certainly not boring, especially with this good cast of actors. But it is like going to a toy store instead of a movie.",1
1722,"Typical Marvel-character-introduction-movie, entertaining but not something out of expect. Cool visual. Fight scenes are boring.",1
1723,"E-Value: 7Acting: 8Plot: 7After being teased during the post-credits scene of Avengers: Infinity War, Captain Marvel is officially making her cinematic debut in the twenty-first instalment of Marvel Cinematic Universe which not only focuses on her origins but exploring her absence throughout the years of the franchise.Set in the year of 1995, Carol Danvers/Vers (Larson) is a member of Kree Empire’s Starforce with Yon-Rogg as her mentor and commander. While her team are being sent out on a mission to rescue an undercover operative from the Skrulls, they manage to ambush the Starforce and Vers got capture in the process.The Skrull commander, Talos (Mendelsohn), have Vers subject to memory probe to look for something within her mind. She manages to escape from her captors but ends up in crash-landing in Earth. Her presence in Earth attracts the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Nick Fury (Jackson) and Phil Coulson.After Fury kills a Skrull disguising as Coulson and Vers decides to lay low for a while, they end up meeting each other in a bar where he learns from her that the Skrulls are in Earth and capable of shape-shifting. Vers tells Fury that she has recurring nightmares and saw an old woman named Dr. Wendy Lawson, whom she somehow appears to know her. In addition, she also reveals that she has been on Earth before and her past memories seem to have come back slowly. Both Vers and Fury agree to work together to stop the Skrulls and finding some answers to Ver’s past.Despite the online trolls claiming the movie will be terrible, those claims are definitely not true. The movie is not bad at all. Although this movie does not live up to the quality of the previous Marvel solo movies and DC’s Wonder Woman, it is still a good and entertaining movie to enjoy. It was a really fun and a nice addition to the franchise before the upcoming Avengers: Endgame in the following month.Brie Larson’s performance as Captain Marvel is very good and she is definitely born to play the role of this superheroine. Besides her, Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn have done a very impressive performance in this movie. The de-aging process was very well done for Jackson and Clark Gregg and they look exactly younger realistically speaking.While the movie does have some heart-warming and comedic moments, the plot of the movie is fine but I noticed there are some minor retcons and small continuity errors such as S.H.I.E.L.D. being referred by its abbreviation in this movie but in 2008’s Iron Man (which took place after this movie) had S.H.I.E.L.D. goes by its full name until the end of the movie. I won’t spoil the rest of them here but I leave them for you to find out. If you are willing to overlook these small errors, you will have no problem enjoying the movie.As mentioned earlier, Avengers: Endgame is just right around the corner and I definitely recommend that you watch this movie first. You know what to do during the credits. Stay back for two post-credits scenes.",1
1724,"Really funny for a standalone, the alchemy between Captain Marvel and Fury is so cool",1
1726,"Don't hate the art because of the artist. Certainly not the best Marvel film, Captain Marvel still holds your attention throughout. Stunning visuals, decent plot, and good acting and this is still one of the better films I've seen in the past year.",1
1727,"This is easily one of the best presentation movies on the MCU. The order of the movie is an original way of storytelling in Marvel. All of the characters shine on their own way and the plot twists are surprising, not predictable as most Marvel movies were starting to be.",1
1728,"Captain Marvel isn't just a feat of directing and good writing, the acting is some of the liveliest in a Marvel movie.",1
1729,Great soundtrack and references to 90s music. Beautiful 3D effects. Nice plot. My favorite from Marvel.,1
1730,"This is a fine example on why you should never listen to the user score on Metacritic. I don't know who hurt these people, but their absolute hatred of this movie is completely unfounded. I wonder how many people actually saw the movie. I for one, did. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Were there some cheesy moments, absolutely, but I felt those moments actually enhanced the film. If I had to find something to complain about, it would be a few of the CGI scenes were not perfect and took me out of the movie a bit. But beyond that, I felt it was great.",1
1731,"Captain Marvel has been getting a lot of hate for some reason.  Some people don’t want to see the movie because they think it has an uber social justice warrior stink about it, but that can’t be further from the truth.  Does Captain Marvel say women can do anything men can do in the Marvel universe?  Yes.  But so does Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, and Avengers: Infinity Crusade.  Does Captain Marvel have potentially the most powerful female character so far?  Yes, but the power is not her own.  It is acquired.  Does Captain Marvel spit on men and make them out to be total losers?  Hell no.  Captain Marvel is a movie about a female superhero who wants help from those around her, and it’s probably the best female superhero movie I’ve ever seen, even if there    were a few issues with it storywise.    Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) is a member of the Kree Starforce who are on a militaristic bent to wipe out everything in the universe that isn’t Kree.  They are ruled over by the Supreme Intelligence, a computer system that run the empire.  The military works with the Accusers, fanatics who do a lot of dirty things to keep the empire in order.  Carol—or Vers, as she is called by her colleagues—works under Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), a man who is trying to bring out the best warrior he can in Vers, only she keeps relying on power that the Kree don’t understand and don’t want her to use unless it’s for their cause.  On a mission with the others to track down and destroy some Skrulls, Vers is captured and subjected to a memory probe that shows her a planet she doesn’t know.  She escapes and crash lands on said planet, Earth, where she meets Nick Fury and Phil Coulson, and they help her discover what is going on.    Captain Marvel has a lot going for it, but the weakest thing is probably the script.  The script is far from horrible, but it could have dealt with another rewrite.  And while there were no plot holes that I noticed, the story overall was a fun sci-fi adventure in the Marvel Universe that really did not feel connected to the rest of the current Marvel Cinematic Universe—even with the post-credit scenes—much the way The Incredible Hulk and Guardians of the Galaxy really don't feel connected to the MCU but are.  But I was happy that the writers did take a moment to explain why the Kree Supreme Intelligence looks the way it does in the film instead of just angering fans because it’s not a giant head.    And while Brie Larson is a great-looking Captain Marvel, she just did not feel authentic in the role.  That might change upon more watches, but for now, I’m not unhappy with her, but I think another actor choice might have been better.  I feel the same for Ben Mendelsohn, who I really like as an actor, but who I felt was completely out of place in the MCU in general.  However, the rest of the cast was stellar, from Jude Law to the de-aged Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg.  Both seemed completely at home, though Clark Gregg seemed a little weird to me, but it might have just been because he had hair in the movie.  And no one can forget Goose.    The special effects in the movie were stunning.  The space battles were great (and thankfully not too many of them), and the de-aging effects were better than I’ve ever seen.  Samuel L. Jackson looks just like he did in 1995.  And the costume and the way they made Captain Marvel glow was awesome to see.  Everything made the movie feel like a Marvel movie, even if the script didn’t completely make it feel like it belonged.    Overall, Captain Marvel is definitely a movie to see in the theater and pick up on blu-ray.  It’s not boring.  The pacing wasn’t off, and there are no dull spots.  There was also no man-bashing or “I am woman, hear me roar” in it.  Special effects were good, and there were a few surprising moments.  The directors did a good job with the movie, but Captain Marvel might have been better served with better directors and perhaps a better actor for the main character.    And opinions regarding Brie Larson can change after another viewing.",1
1732,Surprisingly good movie. All those complaints about an emotional performance turned out to be completely wrong. The times when that were true it fit exactly with the character. If she didn't play it that way it would have been bad acting.,1
1733,"I thought this movie was fantastic. Not only was the acting fantastic, but the script was full of funny banter, references to the MCU, and even started with a heartwarmingly tragic nod to Stan Lee. The plot of the movie was so well thought out and connects so well to a multitude of other MCU films. As always, Samuel L Jackson brought a fantastic skill set to the table as Nick Fury and Brie Larson's fun but badass attitude matched Carol Danver's personality perfectly. The whole film was filled with hilarious 90's references, but enough jokes for younger audiences to appreciate too. That's all without the empowering feminist subtext that truly made the movie a joy to watch. I'll be honest, I'm only writing this review because of the mass negative feedback trolls have been giving this movie. For those people, my message is simple; If your masculinity is so fragile that a fictional woman being powerful upsets you as much as the comments say, you've honestly lost the right to call yourself a man. It's a new era, asshats. Women get some representation. Shocking, I know.To the people who are considering seeing this movie, especially women, go. For. It. It's an amazingly powerful movie with plot twists and themes that make Carol Danvers more of a hero than many of the male members of the MCU.",1
1734,Great movie! I'm definitely going to watch it a second or even a third time. Don't listen to all these negative reviews on any website. Haters gonna hate!,1
1735,"Great Marvel entry!, Solid as other MCU movies, but  lacking in it's own identity, mistakes that once were part of phase 1 entries. That being said, and controversy aside, this movie will be better enjoyed when a new phase kicks in, and the dust settles in Avengers: Endgame.",1
1736,"I'm never a fan of dragging politics into anything, even other politics. So I was a little hesitant here. Overall not the best, but not the worst Marvel movie. It's a lot of fun. I could watch it again, like on DVD, which is more than I can say for like Black Panther at least",1
1737,A really fun movie with a twist you don't see in comic books often.  What's sad is that there's so many fragile men who have to come here and try to tear it down with lame excuses. I'm real sorry the main actress did act melodramatic or cry or scream like you think would be more fitting for a female lead. Grow up.,1
1738,"It is not a masterpiece and it is not the best film of the MCU but it is not even the worst. It makes you have fun, entertains you ... in short, it does what I expect from a cinecomic.",1
1739,People were so underrated this movie. Why? You are so sceptic. Don't you see it?,1
1740,"A bit slow in the first act, Brie Larson's performance can get better but she has real potential. Ben Mendelsohn's performance is great and so is his story arc. It's a joy to watch Samuel L. Jackson as a young Nick Fury. Captain Marvel is a bit over powered, at times she feels like a Mary Sue, but at least that has a meaning. And yes, this does has a femenist agenda, but that's NOT a bad thing. Captain Marvel feels like a phase 1 movie packed in right before Endgame to spawn interest in the MCU. Overall, not bad.",1
1741,"Overall, I felt Captain Marvel was a good movie. Not great, bad, or mediocre. There were parts of the film that I loved, and parts that I didn’t like. Captain Marvel is the weakest film in Phase 3 of the MCU, but not a weak film overall. I also felt like Captain Marvel was just an appetizer for Avengers: End Game, rather than an origin story for the most powerful hero, that will lead the MCU after Avengers.",1
1742,"Good movie not the best but a good movie, fun, with the just comedy, a powerfull hero but not like the comics (in the comics is (200% more powerfull), i go to see again =)",1
1743,Don't listen to that trolls. It was a wonderful movie with a beautiful message.,1
1744,"Loved everything about it except the lead - and she did have two great scenes, even if the latter led directly to a rather tepid and chaotic action sequence. Goose was awesome.",1
1745,TBH this wasn't the best marvel movie but as i watched it i felt so overjoyed. this is one of my favorite marvel movies I've seen and it was full of cool and fun scenes. ill be honest i'm the biggest fan of brie Larson cause her acting was a little bland but overall i really enjoyed the movie especially the end credit scene which was one of my favorite parts of the movie.,1
1746,"Another solid cinematic experience from Marvel.  I have enjoyed pretty much every MCU film to date.  Some (like Iron Man 2 and Thor 2) were fine, but nothing I would seek out for repeat viewing.  This was in the next tier up.  I enjoyed the whole experience, but there wasn't anything too amazing or earth shattering.  It left me eager for the next chapter in Avengers Endgame.",1
1747,"Lets just start here with the obvious. Reading through these reviews were a genuine treat, I have never had a better time giggling at comments with my friends.But lets get to the point! Captain Marvel, a solid movie. Sure, its not Infinity War, but it is a great little stand alone movie. The main character was charming, and the color choices were fantastic. I greatly enjoyed every moment with Nick Fury, but that should be no surprise, he's freakin' Nick Fury.Support cast was solid. Not gonna spoil anyone, but I had a good time with everyone. They had a major and minor plot twist from the comics that caught me off guard but I adored. Playing with expectations is one of the best things they could do! If I wanted exactly the same as the comics, I'd go read the comics. I want something using my favorite characters but NEW and DIFFERENT, which is what we got here.Downsides? At a few points the CG got kinda rough. I can think of two scenes in particular where the CG took me out of the moment and cracked immersion a little. It took a bit to wind up for me as well! I enjoyed the early scenes well enough, but I could feel myself waiting for it to build up, which took about twenty minutes, maybe thirty. I wasn't watching the clock.Still! I strongly recommend this to everyone. It was genuinely a fun time all the way through, and had me bobbing a bit in my seat in a few moments. Also, love the cat.",1
1748,"This movie has received a lot of hate mostly due to how it does not cater to lonely 'nice guys' and their views on how women should look / act. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!! I cannot stress how important this movie is; as it is one of the first mainstream movies to provide a relatable, positive role model for young and older men and women alike. The narrative was interesting and entertaining to follow, having both lighthearted and serious scenes. Captain Marvel's actress played her perfectly! The movie was also riddled with Marvel Lore- fitting into the Marvel universe and timeline nicely. Overall, it was an excellent movie, with marvel stepping in the right direction!",1
1749,"This movie is great fun and I'm gonna watch it a second time for sure. My expectations were really high and it matched them. Brie Larson plays a refreshingly unpretentious Carol Danvers, much more like a Guardian Of The Galaxy rather than an Avenger",1
1750,"Ótimo filme vale o ingresso!!! gostei bastante da forma como contam a ""origem"" da personagem.",1
1751,"The latest in the ever increasing catalogue of movies set in the MCU most of the build has focused on the off screen comments of lead actress Brie Larson with the internet community, as it usually does, blowing things out of all proportion. As with a good few Marvel movies Captain Marvel can sometimes feel like an extended prologue for more significant upcoming events, and there is nothing all that surprising, but put all the ‘controversy’  aside and you’re left with a decent enough film that offers the usual mix of action and humour that audiences have come to expect.",1
1752,Easily one of the best MCU movies I've watched. Would definitely watch it again. Super funny extremely characteristic protagonist and nice effects.,1
1753,"I just left the movie and while it isn't the best Marvel movie by a stretch, it is very watchable, fills in back story, and is fun if you let it be. It is tough to follow Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther, AntMan, etc., and no, this movie does not compete with those, but it isn't the dog that the zealots have made it out to be. A warning to all dudes who live in their mom's basements, there are a lot of strong female protagonists in this film, so if that freaks you out or makes you huffy, be prepared.",1
1754,"This is easily a top 10 MCU movie. The story and character development is solid. The movie experience is spectacular. Brie Larson does a great job portraying someone who has had their identity ripped from them and spends the story trying to reclaim that identity. A lot of people complain that she ""doesn't show enough emotion"" but I say that is a farce since her character is constantly being told to contain her human-side. Can't wait to see Carol Danvers again next month.",1
1755,This movie was great. Brie played a great and troubled person coming to grips with her new found identity and enemy's coming at her from every direction. When her full powered were fully realised it was one of the finest MCU moments. It had a few flaws but there is too much cool stuff to complain about them.,1
1756,"I really enjoyed this movie. Brie Larson was spot-on as Carol and she shines in the role. I've been a Marvel comics reader for nearly 40 years now and this golden age of comic-book films has been surreal. Seeing Captain Marvel on screen is one of the highlights of this era. Sure, the movie isn't perfect, but it is very good. It spends just enough time setting you up and defies the worn-out origin story to deliver something fresher than we've seen before.There is plenty of room for folks not to like a thing -- I get that -- but the concerted effort by a few disgruntled troglodytes should not factor into your decision about whether or not to see this film. If the idea of an empowered female superhero upsets you, then, yeah, this movie isn't for you. For everyone else, enjoy the movie.",1
1757,"(We all are aware of the organized trolling campaign of user ratings against this film, right?  So it should go without saying to take the user rating aggregate with a MASSIVE grain of salt, yes?)Much like Carol's comic book history, the plot of the film is complicated, more than it should be.  The first half of the film is a write-off... for an alien warrior without a past, Larson plays Danvers bafflingly chipper and flighty and we're given a tonally bizarre 90s buddy cop (which appears to be the sole reason the film is set in the 90s, by the way).However, the second half is where the film shines.  Interesting (though again, complicated) plot twists, mind-blowing fights and an amazing message of empowerment that will have you cheering.  Move over Mr. Rogers, there's a new Captain in town!",1
1758,"Really good movie! Worth all the waiting and hype.Brie Larson nailed it. Goose was amazing.Overall, very entertaining one with good retro vibes.",1
1759,Good Origin movie with entertaining scenes between Carol & Nick Fury with awesome post credit scene Marvel fans loved it definitely,1
1760,Brie larson was born to play Carol Danvers and delivers another great performance.,1
1761,An adventurous journey and new paths in MCU are introduced. Go and experience this journey which will make you feel amazing.,1
1762,"Don't listen to the village idiots of the internet, Captain Marvel is a fun addition to the MCU that will surely please both fans of the films and the source material.",1
1763,Take your daughter to see this movie!!! This is one of the best marvel movies!,1
1764,"This is movie is so awesome, i really loved it the story is great and so is the action what's not to love i really recommend it.",1
1765,"This movie is a perfect introduction to a powerful new character to the MCU. Brie Larson is an empowering, witty hero who leaves us wanting more as I look forward to seeing her character develop throughout more movies starting with Avengers Endgame. Although the action may be slow at times, the film finishes with one of the most epic action scenes to date as Carol discovers what shes truly capable of. Fury finally being in a leading role is a refreshing take on the character as her buddy cop-like relationship with Carrol is the heart and soul of the film. Although the film may not follow the source material to a tee it does offer an all-new unexpecting arc to the Kree-Skrull war. Overall this movie is nothing short of amazing, knowing the future of the MCU is in powerful hands is a fantastic feeling and I look forward to seeing more.",1
1766,"Como pelicula de origen esta bien, no es la peor ni la mejor de marvel pero es entretenida. No se si la veria una seegunda vez. Le daria un 7, pero pongo 10 por los trolls.",1
1767,"I've never been much of a fan of Carol in the comics (I didn't much like Stark prior to his first movie either), but she was built as a fun and compelling character in this. The Kree and Skrulls were both done wonderfully, there were unique twists on the characters of Mar-Vell and Talos, and it naturally connected to other pieces of the cosmic MCU. Fury, Coulson, and Goose were also all wonderfully done. Marvel seems to have figured out how to reliably make solid villains finally, since we're on a roll with Vulture, Killmonger, Ghost, Thanos, and now this movie. Probably one of the best 'origin' movies I've seen in a while.",1
1768,"Don't listen to the white men trying to destroy this movie simply because of something Brie Larson ""said"", which first of all she absolutely never said (it was about another movie and she was talking about movie critics, saying most movie critics were white men, and that there should be women and people of color too for the critics to be more diverse and accurate WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE), and that second of all doesn't have anything to do with the movie itself, which was as good as the other marvel movies I went to watch in my life.",1
1769,I really don't know why everyone hates this movie. If you like marvel movies you'll like this one ,1
1770,"It needed to shed 30 minutes, but I liked it. Compared to the rest of the MCU, I'd place it somewhere in the middle next to Doctor Strange and Homecoming.",1
1771,"Captain Marvel great movie? No. Decent to movie? YesCaptain Marvel deserves bad reviews? MaybeIt seems that all the bad reviews are not based on people's opinions of the movie. It is based on ignorance, pettiness, and people haters. Seems sad.",1
1772,"Don't let the guys with fragile masculinity put you off with their 0/10 reviews, this is a great film with a ton of charm. The trailers for the film were horrible and you can tell from these reviews who actually saw the film and who decided they hated the film before it even came out. Brie Larson and Samuel L Jarson have a ton of chemistry and the film overall is engaging from start to finish.",1
1773,"Captain Marvel introduces Carol Danvers to the MCU with a stand alone movie set nearly 2 decades before Iron Man. Like Wonder Woman before it, Captain Marvel fills a very large hole in superhero movies of a female driven story featuring a strong heroine. While Captain Marvel is not in the top tier of MCU movies, it definitely isn't one of the worst.  With a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat along with a strong cast, Captain Marvel is a welcomed addition to the every growing MCU.",1
1774,"For me this is beautiful movie. I don't understand the hate around Brie Larson, she was genius. I love thee fact that Captain Marvel is not the next female hero with big cleavage to attract men. Every time she is on the screen she's just a normal woman without sexist details, without emphasizing the fact that she is a woman. She is strong, confident, brave and very funny without forcing herself to prove something. She is a great character, a great hero and her origins story is very original. It's not like every boring story.I love the twist there, it makees movie very interessting and what more important the movie is NOT BORIG AT ALL! It's funny, there is action all the time, lots of plots happening, you just cant be bored. I cant wait to see Carol in Endgame and I cant wait to see Captain Marvel again! I totally recommend watching it if you're a true marvel fan and youre not a sensitive alpha male who is triggered with the fact that woman is a main character with cool superpowers ;)",1
1775,"Truly marvelous movie! I especially love it when movies based on comic books are told in comic book fashion. That is, this movie almost feels like reading a lengthy graphic novel (in a good way). The pace of Captain Marvel keeps you engaged and many shots reminded me of her aesthetic in the comic books. Strong performances all around, Brie shining the brightest. This movie represents a coherent and logical progression in the MCUas well. Without spoilers, I would like to finish: I loved how this story was told and while too cerebral for some I found this movie to be among the most clever and brilliant, bar none.",1
1776,"I loved this movie. The movie was great, was funny, action packed, and I thought they did a very good job. Definitely hyped for end game and can't wait. Don't listen to all these negative reviews, go see the movie!",1
1777,"The moment it ended, I wished I could stay and just watch it again. I can’t wait to see it again! Brie Larson is fantastic, and so is this movie. It’s a shame a bunch of pathetic dudes can’t get over themselves to enjoy this movie, they’re missing out. It’s VERY funny, and the soundtrack is awesome. Don’t listen to the trolls who haven’t even seen the movie, take your girls to see this. I wish I could have seen it when I was a kid.",1
1778,"One of the most entertaining superheros movies i have seen in a while. Captain Marvel is a great superhero film with heart and pasion. Brie Larson does a great job bringing this character to life for the first time on the big screen. It has great character moments especially from Sam L. Jackson and Brie Larson. It is action-pacted, funny and also really well made. Even though it may fall flatt at times, it is still a great origin story that feels original and fresh.",1
1779,This movie was another incredible Marvel movie that was highly representative of all people and equal rights. The movie put into perspective what it is like to push the discriminations and limits pressured upon women and other minorities. It was very well done.,1
1780,"So sad that the user score is so low for the only reason of masculinity being so fragile, like for real, is a really good movie, don't take the users review seriously because they are only trolls that got offended for nothing, the acting is great, nice effects and while is not the best plot ever the movie is entertaining with great action scenes and touching moments, it has everything to be among the Marvel movies",1
1781,"Movie's pretty good, well-made Marvel film through-and-through. Brie Larson does a nice job, and there's a couple twists that I did not see coming. Looking forward to Endgame.",1
1782,"very well done, empowering, open and funny. will definitely go and watch endgame!",1
1783,I do not remember a female character so powerful. Stan Lee always kept a very advanced vision and broke with stereotypes and that's why I love his characters.Love this movie is to love the vision of Stan Lee. The film meets to introduce this character in the universe. Spotlight the qualities of Captain Marvel who are even more impressive for being human and woman.I highly recommend it and don’t let you be manipulated by critics of people who have´t read the comics and do not know the role of Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel in the current universe of Marvel.(Español)No recuerdo un personaje femenino tan poderoso. Stan Lee siempre mantuvo una visión muy adelantada y rompía con los estereotipos y por eso amo a sus personajes. Amar esta película es amar la visión de Stan Lee. La película cumple para introducir a este personaje en el universo. Destaca las cualidades del súper héroe que son aún más impresionantes por ser humana y mujer.La recomiendo ampliamente y nos dejen manipular por criticas de personas que no han leído los comics y no saben el papel que ocupa Carol Danvers / Capitana Marvel en todo el universo actual de Marvel.,1
1784,I really dont get why everybody is hating! Just another poor hatehype of the internet. Captain Marvel is not the best marvel movie but definitely a good one!,1
1785,It is an amazing movie. People are just whiners over her saying something off screen.An actress who said something offscreen is apparently making decision for a production company that worked hard for 11 years. That is idiotic on people's part. If people are gonna start looking for feminine thing in movie then they will definitely find it as they are looking for it specifically and forgot to enjoy the movie. Brie Larson did an amazing job. YES EVEN WITH EXPRESSIONS. It was late 90's and the jokes are of that time only. PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO START USING THEIR BRAINS,1
1786,"Get's an 8/10 from us. Very fun super hero film. I thought the lead actress did a great job. Fury, Coulson, and the cat were great. Great music score. Fantastic special effects. As others have stated the hero powering up is awesome. She will offer an interesting dynamic to the Avengers team in the next film.Regardless of all the silly overblown internet nonsense surrounding the film it was great and we would see it again. Bring on Endgame.",1
1787,"Definitely one of the better MCU origin stories. Beautiful visuals, and an engaging story with several unexpected reveals and satisfying connections to the wider MCU story. Compared to other MCU origin movies that set up a greater story, it is definitely the most entertaining story of the lot and contains great twists. Brie Larson does a good job in introducing her character into the MCU and her supporting cast are all amazing in their roles. Standouts include the characters of Talos, Goose, Monica and Maria, Nick and the Supreme Intelligence. Sets up the movie very well for Avengers Endgame and gives context to a number of earlier films. Love it and can't wait to re-watch again and again!",1
1788,"Although a little unnecessary, Captain Marvel is still a very enjoyable film for Marvel fans who appreciate references   of this grandeur. Meaning me",1
1789,"I have never cared about superheroes. This is a lie. I used to revere Spider-man. And The Batman. And for a brief while, I thought of myself as a version of the Hulk, whereas my superpowered gamma monster was simply undiagnosed anxiety and depression when faced with social gatherings. I always wanted superheroes to speak to me, as much as cultural figure Mr. Spock spoke to me. By gently urging me to live long, and prosper, I learned that an alien computer man could love and be loved in return. I’ve already gone way off the rails. Captain Marvel. A superhero who shares the name of the company who made them. And did you know that DC comics (redundant) also has a Captain Marvel, aka Shazam? Marvel is quite a popular superhero name amongst superheroes. I want to talk about Captain Marvel, aka Ms Marvel aka Carol Danvers. Not Captain Marvel aka Shazam aka Billy Batson. And Not MarvelMan aka MiracleMan aka Michael Moran. Captain Marvel is a film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that is the first woman superhero standalone movie. However, it is not the first woman superhero movie, as Wonder Woman from DC arrived earlier and was successfull despite male producers trying to make it suck. However seeing as Marvel has made 20+ superhero movies, and this is the first to star a woman, their ratio of gender equality is far lower than DC who has made only Batman, Superman, Green Lantern then Wonder Woman and Aquaman movies from their storied ouvre. Marvel has had movies staring Iron Man, Spider-Man, Blade, Fantastic Four, X-Mens, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Guardians of Galaxies, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Doctor Strange and all of the Avengers before they finally put a lady in the hotseat with Captain Marvel. I sincerely hope there are 20 woman led superheroes before the next man led one comes back to screen. I know this isn’t true, because there’s another Spider-Man movie coming out before I finish this sentence.Look what’s happened, my review of the first Marvel studios woman superhero movie has been stalled by all the men before her. What accuracy of the universe to set precedence of the men before talking about a woman. Captain Marvel is a god damned delight. It is set in 1995. An era filled with delightful pop culture. It is an action movie, where the superhero is the most powerful superhero with the most powerful powers. It has a buddy cop movie vibe with a de-aged Samuel L Jackson who definitely is too old for this **** (sorry Danny Glover). There is an all powerful kitty cat who is held by a de-aged Sam Jackson for most of the film. There is, quite frankly, nothing to dislike about Captain Marvel. Brie Larson plays a wonderful character who has lived a full life, then had her memories erased by magic/science before being re-raised as an alien-militaristic-imperialist-warrior for several years. Spoilers. Brie Larson is subtle, yet brilliant. She is funny, charming, smart and dramatic, and she rocks one hell of a 90’s look. Her superhero outfit is great too. Props to the propmasters. The supporting cast is fine. They do their job and don’t steal the thunder of Brie Larson. Jude Law looks very greasy and talks very loudly and confidently. Samuel Jackson doesn’t seem to know where he is or what movie he’s in, but is such a delightful actor it doesn’t matter. Clark Gregg returns as a guy who was in other movies, but this time he is de-aged and honestly, they didn’t pull it off. Lashana Lynch plays Brie Larson’s friend / family from the past and is wonderful. Annette Benning is in this movie. Ben Mendelsohn is a Skrull. There are plenty of other characters too. The practical effects of the Skrulls is good, but doesn’t allow for a lot of face articulation, so they all have face constipation. The digital effects are quite good in many areas, especially the kitty cat, who is 90% CGI. This is a story of a woman. There are terrible men who try to hold her down, but she doesn’t let that happen. If you want to get some really strong feelings in your heart and gut, Captain Marvel will give them to you. Here’s what you should know going into the movie… Shut up. Sit down. Watch it. Enjoy it. Then tell other people to watch it, but shut up after that.",1
1791,"This movie kept getting better and better as I watched. I was expecting to underwhelmed, but was pleasantly surprised that Bree Larson really owns the chutzpah of this character and there are some genuinely iconic moments handled more deftly and authentically than most Marvel films to date. I was really worried that this movie would fall flat. It soars!",1
1792,"Captain Marvel is jam packed with action and is a delight to watch. The humour comes thick and fast but never feels forced or prevents the narrative from including a lot of genuinely touching moments.As a fan of the Captain Marvel comics it was a little nerve-wracking waiting to see how the MCU would handle such a layered, powerful character with a back story more tangled than most. Would the Carol I know be the same on screen? After seeing the movie, any worries I had evaporated faster than you can say ""Lt Trouble"".Brie Larson did an incredible job of bringing Carol to life and was an absolute joy to watch. The whole cast gave stellar performances, from Sam Jackson's cat-loving S.H.I.E.L.D agent to Lashana Lynch's awesome air force pilot. Clark Gregg's return was brief but impactful and Annette Bening shone in her most mysterious role yet.People who haven't seen the other MCU movies or read any of the comics needn't worry, there were plenty of subtle references, cameos and easter eggs included but there was no prior viewing or reading required.Then there's the soundtrack, which has to be one of the best movie soundtracks ever! The film-makers made some bold decisions of where to use some of the iconic, grungier tracks of the 90s and for me every single one of them paid off. The 90s references don't end there either, and anyone who remembers the period will feel a few pangs of nostalgia throughout and find themselves remembering things they didn't realise they ever forgot (which is very fitting considering the plot) but it's never leaned on too heavily.Unfortunately Captain Marvel is held back in the same way so many origin stories are. Having to introduce new races to the MCU and explain how a hero gets their powers is always going to take up valuable screen time. Carol's life before her powers is a fascinating one and I was left wanting to see more. But this is a super hero movie after all and so the focus will always have to be on that aspect of her life.Overall the movie is incredibly fun to watch. Perfectly cast, with amazing effects and a plot that impressively manages to be both familiar and unpredictable.",1
1793,"the cat is so good in this movie, forget brie larson, samuel l jackson and everyone else. The cat is the star and carrys the movie on it's cat backs.",1
1794,"I would like to say that Carol and Nick's relationship is the core of the movie. I absolutely loved it! Brie Larson portrayed the role of Captain Marvel in an incredible way. I really felt connected to the character. I'm pretty excited to see her role in Endgame. I also loved Samuel's performance to Nick Fury, bringing the soft side of Nick, but also the badass we know him for. The supporting cast did a great job too. I just hoped they had more scenes in the film were we could've explored them more. The action scenes are well choreographed. The score is well-composed. The visual effects are amazing, except when Carol unlocked her full power. Some scenes weren't edited in the best way.  But still, she was cool! I hoped that the battles scenes were longer, cuz I really enjoyed them. Carol's past is told in a clever way. I just hoped they focused on the Kree-Skrull war more. The plot included a lot of surprises. Absolutely loved the cat and Ben Mendelsohn as Talos. Overall, it's a pretty well-made movie with a lot of humor. I wished the movie was longer but I enjoyed it a lot! Also, the end credits scenes got me more excited for Endgame.",1
1795,"Ignore the review bombing, this is one of the best Marvel films. Had a great time.",1
1796,"This movie is good but at the same time it is mediocre. I think it is not necessary to watch this movie to understand the ""End game"". Sometimes it's a bit of a feminist with no sense coming out of the context but it's not a very bad movie.",1
1797,"The online campaign against this movie is coming from James Cameron.  All Marvel fans should boycott his movies indefinitely.  Hell, anyone who has ever seen one of his movies probably already is.",1
1798,"Really great, loved it. Brie Larson was great, good setup for Endgame. Don't know why so many people dislike it.",1
1799,"This IS a film you CAN watch and enjoy if you know nothing about the MCU or indeed the comics, there is something for everyone here and EVERYONE will love Goose the Cat. A solid foundation for future solo outings with solid performances from all cast members, not perfect but no origin movie for an unknown character to moviegoers ever is (I class Black Panther as more introducing Wakanda than just a character and is an outstanding exception to the rule deserving of its awards and nominations).FIRST OFF THIS IS NOT A SJW FILM, yes there are few moments when every day issues women have to deal with crop up, including the whole smiling issue, but it is not in your face or frequent. It may have been stronger if they had dealt with sexism head on but they opted to sidestep the gender politics it is accused of being about in the main. What some have tried to label as snobbish most women would recognise as every day ignoring the idiots and not letting them get you down and that's about it. Danvers is not one who expects equality on a plate, she gets knocked down or insulted she brushes it off. This is a strong, intelligent woman who works hard to earn respect and get what and where she wants in life, knock her down she gets back up and fights harder, refuse to pay for her to go to college she goes out, joins the Air Force and puts herself through college and appears comfortable and at ease in the company of men, no signs of the bitterness you might expect from the characters life story. Some may expect a female character to more openly display a wider range of stronger emotions but that simply would not be realistic for a USAF pilot who has spent 6 years convinced that she is part of a race who in the comics routinely lobotomise their women to suppress emotions and pleasure to prevent them controlling the men.After 20 MCU movies it is impossible not to do the compare it to ALL the rest test but if you strip out the team films (inc Guardians and Civil war) this film stands amongst the best. Out strips the first two Thor movies by a mile, better than the incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Ant man 1 & 2 (unless your only after a comedy). After that it becomes more debatable depending on taste, and yes, gender. This IS a film women will tend to enjoy more than men and does give a strong role model for girls but it is a film men WILL enjoy too. It has similar pacing and structure to Iron Man 3 with strong action packed opening act, followed by ‘Vers’ crashing to Earth (at around the point in Iron Man 3 his house fell into the sea) and having to rediscover who she is through a new friendship (this time amnesia rather than PTSD) before heading into an action packed finale and is just as enjoyable as Iron Man 3.All the performances from the cast were brilliant, I can understand some criticism about the way Danvers was written but she was true to what you would expect considering her military background etc it is true to life but I get that some ALWAYS want larger than life. Once she puts the pieces of her life back together and embraces her humanity she is every bit and more what you would want or expect both as person and as a superhuman. The chemistry and friendship between Brie and Samuel shines through in the 90’s style buddy movie middle section of the film. It could have been far stronger if it had taken more risks, tried to be more niche but at this stage in the Avengers story arc this was more about introducing the new character to be joining the team without wanting to make waves and it IS a solid foundation for future solo outings as well as starting to set up potential larger story arcs for AFTER end game. It is an origin story so like most it has issues due to having to explain how she got her powers, explore the powers, small voyage of personal discovery for the main hero and explain the two alien races all having to be crammed in. There is no love interest which is a plus and instead starts a true new friendship between Danvers and Fury and a true and deep, loving friendship rekindled between Carol and her fellow female pilot Maria Rambeau. There is no BIG enemy as such in this movie which some may view as a negative as there never feels like that life or death threat we are used to in CBM’s but for me gave the characters room to breath. This was a soldier separated from her squad in the middle of a war then questioning her role in that war so no overpowered enemy to fight for most the film is refreshing considering the HUGE fight she is going to be part of in the last Avengers film released just a month after this one.",1
1800,"Just got back from seeing Captain Marvel, ......And i really liked it! Despite all the sjw **** and everything else thats gone wrong before the premier actually not a bad movie at all.   All they had to do was be quiet and let the marvel name speak for it self and drop a few trailers...... what a Cluster f**k!! =)",1
1801,This is a great movie.Not good for a Marvel movie.Not great for a superhero movie.This is a game-changing film.This will analyzed and discussed like Superman The Movie someday.,1
1802,"Not sure what's going on here with the bad scores but I actually really loved this movie. So much so that I think it is the best Marvel one yet. They were getting a little same old, so so but this  one refreshed it for me.  The sci fi worlds they created were awesome and the tech.  Acting was brilliant!  Action was great and nothing overcooked too much.  Just a great movie!  Go see it.",1
1803,"A lot of trolling going on in these reviews.  You've all heard about it on Rotten Tomatoes.  This is a very good movie, not the best of Marvel's but very good.  The acting is excellent.  The plot is confusing at the beginning.  It is fine to use short flashback to show unconnected memories that are confusing the principle actor but she wasn't confused by them that I could see.  Once past the plethora of flashbacks, the movie settled down and finished up very well.",1
1804,"Yeah I liked it. Brie was in top shape and Samuel LJ was great as (almost) always. Jude Law was surprisingly good. CGI, plot and everything about movie was good. Dont listen to the haters. Go see it, NOW !",1
1805,An enjoyable superhero movie with a good combination of action and humor. i honestly dont understand why so many hate this movie. or the actress,1
1806,"Me sentí casi obligado a verla por EndGame, pero me esperaba algo peor, no es la gran cosa pero está aceptable, creo que deberían mejorar los efectos especiales, sobretodo al final, sentí algo parecido con Thanos en Avengers en cuanto a los efectos especiales, deben mejorarlos. Es una película que máximo vería 2 veces y no más.",1
1807,"Goo, not a perfect movie, but a good movie.Screenplay is simple, the jokes are  interesting, good action sequences and good visual efects.Not is my favorite Marvel's movie, but I like and it's better then THOR 2, Incredible Hulk, THOR and Iron Man3.",1
1808,"after the great films marvel has delivered, this movie might let you down. However it isn't a bad movie overall; don't let brie larson's feminist propaganda get to you, this is just another marvel movie that will help you while you wait for endgame",1
1809,This was a standard flick of Marvel quality. It was a thrilling ride that rarely had meaningless filler.,1
1810,"an amazing movie that i enjoyed a lot. Funny bits, nostalgia bits and bits that were heart warming. So many things that hint to previous movies and upcoming movies. you can not miss this movie, if you did you will have a hard time with Endgame, and don't go so low to read the full plot online, that is not what people should do till after the movie... obviously the 1500+ people with negative reviews don't know anything",1
1811,"What a blast! Ignore the trolls. The movie is great.Great plot, actors, and setting. I think that this may be the best Marvel movie yet. I don’t want to give away anything, but Goose the cat is a total scene stealer!Captain Marvel ties into Avengers Endgame. Make sure you see this one first.",1
1812,"I see lots of people trashing this movie and I'm not entirely sure why. Maybe because of the perceived political pandering (""Captain SJW"" - LOL, neckbeards are funny). I honestly enjoyed this MCU flick more than Iron Man 2, Thor: The Dark World, and Ant Man & The Wasp, all of which seem highly negligible to the MCU in comparison to this entry. The movie had a fun sci-fi vibe with a retro 90's feel. Lots of hilarious punchlines, and some great supporting roles.Was Brie Larson the best actress for the part? That's the question burning everyone's mind as they venture to the cinema for this female-led adventure, which is a first in the Marvel universe. I feel that someone better COULD have been chosen but it's always hard to say exactly who. Comic book fans have a grandiose vision of their favorite heroes built up in their minds and it's literally impossible to appeal to everyone's taste. I can certainly imagine actresses who would be WORSE at this role, but it's a real head-scratcher to think about who might actually do BETTER. More than likely a relatively unknown actress would've been the only choice left, but that's obviously not a gamble that a major film studio would be willing to take.With that being said I still feel Brie handled the role pretty well. I had low expectations going in, and her snarky attitude is almost too much to take in at times, but she made the performance convincing enough for me to suspend my imagination.Aside from the controversy over the lead actress and the stupid political debate (I'm genuinely sick of politics infecting every aspect of our society... movies are just supposed to be fun), the film was just a fun ride from start to finish. It was truly epic seeing Captain Marvel in her full glory tearing everything apart. Sure, it might not rank up there with some of the better films in the MCU but it's definitely a solid entry and it has me hyped up for Avengers: Endgame now.",1
1813,"Very fun film, good action, great character interactions, Skrulls (talos in particular) are a brilliant introduction to the MCU. The de-aging CGI on SLJ is remarkable.",1
1814,"No es mala película, pero tampoco es una obra maestra. Sólo es otra historia de inicio  que desarrolla el mismo arco argumental de siempre. Es una película divertida, para ver un fin de semana o cuando la vuelvan a pasar en algún canal de televisión nacional; pero nada más.",1
1815,"This movie is underrated everyone is making a big deal about the actors performance in my opinion it’s on my top 5 favorite movies and she was great, she won actor of the year.",1
1816,"While the first 15 minutes of the movie were slightly confusing and difficult to get a grasp on (which is the reason for it not getting a full score), it served as a good foundation for later development of the story. Brie Larson delivers a great no-nonsense character in a refreshing way, taking no **** from anyone. Fury and Coulson serve as a good background story for SHIELDs development, and Goose puts the cherry on top of the movie. Would definitely recommend as a must-watch for anyone but fragile broflakes.",1
1817,"Had a good time watching this. I'd compare this the most to the first Captain America in that is a good balance of plot, action, and comedy. This film is surprisingly funny, which the trailers don't reveal. This is a buddy cop/road trip movie featuring interplay between Captain Marvel and Nick Fury.Captain Marvel is likable enough, both confident and charming. Alison Brie does well in the role whenever it comes to the lighthearted bits. However, there are a couple times during the serious/expositional parts where she felt a bit wooden. It doesn't help that her tone of voice doesn't shift much.Although, Nick Fury has been a regular of the Marvel films for a while, it's nice to see him finely be a lead character. Jackson seems to be having a lot of fun playing a younger, looser Fury (this takes place during the 90's).Also a big fan of Ben Mendelsson as Talos, leader of a squad of the shapeshifting enemy race the Skrulls. I was afraid the actor was being typecasted in his villain roles recently, but this character is a total 180 of his previous ones. He's funny and one of the biggest people persons of the MCU villains.Maintains the Marvel spectacle of visuals and action. They use computer graphics to make Jackson look younger and they have really perfected the technology. You only notice the CGI if you're looking for it. The graphics for Coulson aren't quite as seamless. I'm guessing they didn't put as much effort into him as he isn't in this as much. The movie is a very typical Marvel movie. It doesn't establish it's own tone like the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy or Black Panther. Suffers from trying to stuff too much plot and characters in. Marvel's past and relationships are given short shrift. More time should've been devoted to developing the characters of Marvel's best friend and the alien military unit she starts out as a part of.They explain the cause of a certain event/line in a future Marvel movie but by trying to make a joke out of it. I did not like that at all. Robbed the seriousness of that moment and the attempt to play against expectations and the need for movie prequels to explain every little thing is just frustratingly predictable.Ever since the Kree first appeared in Guardians of the Galaxy, I've been waiting to see them adapt the Kree Intelligence who has always had a unique design. We finally get it and sadly the directors/writers just went with the trodden entity appears as someone the person knows routine.Yeah, this isn't the most standout of the films, but I still got a lot of enjoyment out of this.",1
1818,"To be fair Captain Marvel is about on par with the other Marvel origin movies; however, to counter the review bombing it deserves a 10 as it is not getting a fair chance.",1
1819,This movie was the best Marvel movies so far and it's a masterpiece. It shows that women can be strong and they don't need to prove anything to men.,1
1820,"This is the missing piece all Marvel fans need! This movie answers so many questions and it perfectly supplements the timeline connecting ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" with ""The Avengers"". Besides that, it introduces two bad ass characters, that most likely will be important for Endgame. In addition to that, the movie is funny and marvelous, except for one awkward scene where the cousin changes colors (you'll see what I mean by that after watching the movie), that is why its 9/10",1
1821,One of the funniest movies that the MCU has given us . A few pacing issues and less than 5 seconds of mediocre CGI is all that stops Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson from delivering a perfect origin story.,1
1822,"This was a standard flick of Marvel quality. It was a thrilling ride that rarely had meaningless filler. Larson came across as the sarcastic tomboy or logical alien depending upon your point of view. However, her chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson was what was priceless. She wasn't a Mary Sue character and fun to go on this journey with as a character. It definitely made me excited as a Marvel fan and 90s admirer. The soundtrack was perfect. And got me teary-eyed seeing Stan Lee on his last movie cameo for Marvel movies. Overall bravo and will easily watch this in the future like the rest of it's Marvel family.",1
1823,"Me ha encantado, hay conexión con endgame y con el resto del UCM. Super recomendada",1
1824,"Ignore the user score as it's mostly skewed by the many bad scores given by overly sensitive guys who can't take outspoken women. The film had a couple slow parts but overall had great action and humor. Brie Larson did well, as did the other characters, especially Ben Mendelssohn.",1
1825,"The movie is great! I don't' know why the people is detesting it. Brie Larson is perfect as Captain Marvel , Samuel L. Jackson does the best version of Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn does the villian with the best motivation of the MCU. The fight scenes are OK, the visual effects just it's worse in the end, the character of Jude Law isn´t so good, Ronan and Korath are pointless and, the worst thing in the movie, the direction of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are annoing.",1
1826,"Es una buena pelicula de super heroes,tiene muchas referencias y esta bien montada, las personas que la critican porque es ""politicamente correcta"" fueron a verla predispuestos, el personaje es una Mary Sue pero spoiler(en los comics tambien lo es) asi como superman y batman son Gary Stu. Vayan a verla sin prejuicios y la van a disfrutar(se los dice una persona con un humor muy oscuro y que repudia a las feminazis)",1
1827,It's good.  Not the best or the worst Marvel movie but it's an enjoyable film.  I might see it again before Endgame.,1
1828,"This movie tells the story of how Fury becomes the leader of the Avengers, as well as the story of Captain Marvel. The events of the story were not very predictable, but some of it was difficult to follow at the beginning. It's a story about a young woman who comes from another planet. It turns out that she was from Earth all along! In the end, she becomes the leader of the Avengers and destroys the invading enemies. In one scene, she was having a dream about her past memories and suddenly she remembered a very important detail from her past that helps her find her old friends on Earth. Carol has to be brave and struggle in order to survive as a woman trying to work in a traditionally male profession- flying for the Air Force. She has to be patient and react calmly so that she can win her battles gracefully. There were only a few times when I thought the movie was awkward, and they quickly passed. I would recommend this movie and the ending ties in all of the characters from the Marvel universe. I am looking forward to the last movie.",1
1829,"Marvel fans are very uptight and so territorial that Tolkien used them as inspiration for Gollum. When watching the film I could hear them coughing and talking to themselves, silently muttering ""precious"" under their breath. A very uncomfortable movie experience I'll have you know and yet I was able to watch Captain Marvel with a sense of relaxation and immersion. I had zero expectations going into the film. I am by no means a fan of Marvel films, if anything, I think they are money grabbing, mind polluting, art damaging pieces of film. Recently, however, I have seen a conscious effort to use the large budget to actually create something daring and unique, an effort which gave them an Oscar nod, and deservedly so. We are also seeing them cast really talented actors and actresses, such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Brie Larson, both of which have so unapologetically exhibited the art and skill that goes into the portrayal of every character of a well written script. So with the promise of positive change in recent past and near future, I took my seat with an open mind. The positives of this film include its special effects. The CGI is seamless, the special effects makeup is top level, and Samuel L Jackson has never looked better. The concept of the film was solid overall, however, I do think it was a bit too self centred towards the main character herself, which took away from the overall scale and impact of the on screen events. Some scenes are forgettable and even now, a couple of days after watching the film, I struggle to think of an overall plot outside of an individuals self discovery and revelation. That being said, the film incorporates tired, old, boring storylines and puts an enjoyable and original twist on them, for example, the whole idea of amnesia and flashbacks is as tired and old as Samuel L Jackson without anti-aging effects (in fairness that doesn't look that old), however, they successfully navigated this plot detail in a way so that it wasn't cumbersome. The film does have plot holes and questionable logic, however, the movie doesn't take itself seriously enough to warrant anybody to stay up at night questioning them, although I presume the marvel nerds will. If anything, ditching more of the source material and being more inspired by it, including that unnecessary Mohawk, would improve the film. The acting wasn't anything to take note off but I do think Brie Larson was able to have some fun with the role. Samuel L Jackson and Jude Law were similarly satisfactory. Overall, this movie was a successful high budget B movie, never intending (I hope) to cause ripples or revolutionise the industry. If you have an open mind you could be entertained by this film, however, if you are only satisfied by a movie that coincides with what you envisaged then I doubt you will enjoy any film.",1
1830,"Captain Marvel was good...When I say good I mean theres a line or a certain standard for what makes a good marvel movie and you know as well as I that Marvel throws movies every year probably i'd say 3 a year maybe more and thats insane so not every one of them meets a standard for some people or fans theres either they will watch this movie again and again or analyze it to death or just watch it once and leave it there. So this movie is in that line of standard ok it is right on that line I don't see it as sub par or bad even terrible its okay its watchable you can enjoy it it will probably feel monotonous but its a hero movie and yes there are different vibes for a herop movie but this is not that movie hell if anything this movie makes its character super broken because she is but against a movie like wonder woman where there is a certain struggle and conflict with characters well... you wont get much form Carol Danvers she is tough man like no joke powers or not a lot of people can get behind that so bad reviews and allegations aside i being comepletely honest it is an all right movie. You'll have laughs, few gasps some long awaited answers and cravings.",1
1831,"A fun, visually exciting addition to the Marvel franchise. Brie Larson's take on Captain Marvel is both fresh and exciting and had my daughters and me at full attention throughout. We're all looking forward to her continued adventures in the upcoming Avenger's film.",1
1832,"Solid introduction to Captain Marvel. Entertaining film, has a good feel to it - some good action scenes. They've balanced the character well considering the power involved. She's powerful but still has a human element. Good performance from Brie, Jude & Jackson. Mendelsohn was great. Worth it and looking forward to End Game.",1
1833,"This movie is too good but it has flaws.Something that bothers me is that they made the Skrulls a joke like they did with Ultron.This new era in the MCU has a new leader and it is CAROL DANVERS, who came to stay.",1
1834,Super movie.Performance of Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel is outstanding.Post Credits Scene is the best.,1
1835,"I though this installment and addition to the Marvel Universe was quite well done, not as bad as most reviews pretend it to be, and the low rating it got is more due to political reasons than it is about the movie itself. Which is sad and pathetic at the same time. Makes you question the credibility of the rating system altogether. The movie review scene have become a political battlefield of trolls and alike.But back to the movie, it isn't without plotholes, but as like all Marvel movies you have to suspend your believes. Yet again all the superheroes that matters seems to be white caucasians, and the kree and skrull alien race can speak english? Okay Captain Marvel has a universal translator (while the others humans have not and still understood what each other were saying), and she doesnt seem to carry her translator with her all the time, but okay, suspend belief....Other than that it was an entertaining super hero movie, and Brie Larson did a good job in portraying a confused hero trying to find who she was. Brie was compelling, funny, rebellious,  great chemistry with Samuel Jackson, a good role model for the kids and towards the end she really makes you believe she can take on the Universe, and that is the accomplishment you need for a super hero movie!",1
1836,.Captain Marvel is a welcome addition to the MCU. Great tribute to Stan Lee. Brie Larson is great as also S.M.Jackson and Goose,1
1837,"This is a great movie for a general audience who come to it without having expectations for HOW a superhero's origin story should be told. There are several interesting twists and fantastic CGI. The de-aging of Samuel L. Jackson was so flawless I never even thought about it! Brie Larson and Jackson had terrific chemistry. Their scenes together and the comedic use of the cat was quite entertaining and had me laughing aloud several times. I *really* like that they didn't sexualize her! As much as I loved Wonder Woman and enjoyed looking at Gal Gadot, esp. in that role, she always looked like a model, even during her fights, and her costume exposed a lot of her body. In contrast, Captain Marvel's suit covers her whole body, yet she looks sexy in it!  Carol Danvers looks like a tomboy and a fighter pilot, not a model, so she's more relatable to average women. I absolutely love her suit, especially with her CM colors!  She looks feminine w/o having to show skin. I also like that she didn't have a love interest! I actually thought that made her more interesting. Not EVERY story has to have a romantic subplot or a love interest for the lead character. It was interesting that she had a familial bond w/ her best friend and her friend's daughter. One disappointment was that I expected greater emotion from her friend upon seeing Carol, whom she thought was dead, still alive!!  Maybe muting one's emotions are just all part of being a fighter pilot, but it seemed odd to me.  Still, the hug when they both accept what happened was touching, without being sappy. Overall, this piecing together of clues to find out who she is is an interesting way to tell her origin story. They diverged from the comics to create what I think is a better story, leaving out at least one problematic plotline in the comics, and making the Annette Bening character more complex and interesting.  It's difficult to admit when one has been wrong and to change, so that was a positive element of this story.  Seeing Carol Danvers' resistance to mind control near the end was inspiring.  As for criticisms of Brie Larson's portrayal of the character, I still wonder how much of that is because the character never seems like a fish out of water, even when she literally falls onto a ""strange"" planet. Part of Wonder Woman's charm was the humor in how she stuck out when she was Diana Prince, as in, for example, the scene of her carrying her sword around in WW1 London. Her child-like joy (like when she tastes ice cream for the first time) were entertaining, and that's missing from Captain Marvel. Nevertheless, Captain Marvel is her own character, and she smiled and laughed quite a bit in the film, despite her dour expression in the trailers. I enjoyed this movie enough to go see it again. I'm sure I will see things I missed the first time around. I am also looking forward to seeing more Captain Marvel films in the future!",1
1838,"I watched this movie through a feminist lens and it was excellent. However, I can see how someone watching through a different lens viewed it differently. In terms of the acting, I thought all the African American actors were excellent. However, I didn't like little aspects of Larson's fights scenes. I could tell in some scenes that she was holding back punches. And her running form didn't look as fast as her character was portraying. In that respect, I definitely don't think this movie should be rated 0 or 1. At minimum the movie should be rated 5-6. There were action scenes, humorous scenes and plot twists. Thus, I rate this movie an 8 out of 10.Captain Marvel is a story of a woman who figures out her past, finds her truth, and breaks free from her oppression. It's a movie women and girls can watch, and feel empowered by. And, it's message is that when one falls down and faces setback, she should should get back up and break through barriers. This message is something that resonates with women, and can only be appreciated by watching through a feminist lens.",1
1839,"Great film; fascinating story, fantastic script, and brilliant acting by B. Larson, S.L. Jackson, B. Mendelsohn, and J. Law. Very well directed as well.",1
1840,Sexism CANNOT break the sheer beautiful message that this film exudes. Brie Larson's acting shined throughout the movie's duration and once the 2nd act started she met the heights of Tony Stark in this film but in the beginning she was giving me Thor vibes without much direction. I think the movie still had obvious problems and I think her power could hurt her in the future since she's just so powerful and creating fair fights will be hard. The final fight was more emotionally charged with less action. Overall Captain Marvel is a popcorn movie that stands out in the Marvel universe.,1
1841,"way better then expected! Just less good then te other one, can but frustrating when you realise were the mcu came from.",1
1842,"Fair review despite the politicization. The movie appears rushed. The first half of it was really mediocre, the dialogue was awkward, with no coherent flow and the acting was flat and uninspiring with the main heroes. Then half way through it's like they switched directors and you start loving the characters and actually want them to win. I assure you the last half is really good, I wanted to stand up and cheer but there was just 5 other people at the matinee. If you have been watching the other Marvel movies you are not going to want to miss this.This movie is a 5-8. Peoples feelings about this movie are highly politicized because of Bree's comments but the movie did not appear to reflect those views. It is unfortunate that the beginning was so rushed, or whatever happened because I would really like to see a sequel done right.",1
1843,I like the twist about how jude law was actually bad. The movie had plenty of action and i like the fact they chose a woman to be an action hero.,1
1844,"nice movie The plot is quite weak, but not as weak as Brie Larson's acting. Sam Lee Jackson tries to save what he can, but overall it's a bad movie. Not reccomended.https://moviesfun.online/captain-marvel-2019/",1
1845,"Love this movie so much! Brie Larson, the lead actor, injects more emotion into her performance as she breaks free from those who would rather her ""control her emotions"", perfectly aligning with her performance. Brilliant.",1
1846,Is it me or all the bad reviews of the fans of this movie are only of men? What curious is this,1
1847,"I almost didn't see this due to the negative user reviews; I am glad I ended up going and came to the conclusion that this is probably the first time we see the Russian trollbot mafia deployed against a Disney movie, they all seem to tout the same talking points.Brie Larson was actually great in the movie, as were, surprisingly, all the other characters. Two of our old-time heroes appear rejuvenated by heavy CG, which I expected to suck. Didn't. Otherwise, villains and supporting cast alike act believable and fresh.The CG is excellent, the score is excellent, the story was excellent (second time I didn't see the twist coming in a Marvel movie). Like other smaller concept movies (Ant Man/Doctor Strange), this is where Marvel really shines. I liked this one way more than the big Avengers movies.I didn't get a feminist tone from the movie like other reviewers claim - I noticed and felt it was over the top in Star Wars, but nothing like this here. It just so happens that the heroes of the story are female. If you really get troubled by that, you have a different problem.The movie made great references to 90ies themes - feels a lot like Top Gun in places, comes with a scene with a GNR tshirt (that made my day, btw). The title sequence is worth the price of admission alone (not spoiling it, but brought some tears to my eyes).All in all, an unjustly maligned Marvel gem. I didn't care for the logics behind the big end confrontation, so I am subtracting one point for that, even though I feel I ought to give this movie a 10 just to offset the trollbots.EDIT: changing my rating to 10 because I am, after all, upset at the bots ;)",1
1848,"Solid MCU origin movie. It's a funny, action-packed, heroic space adventure and has a few cool twists. Brie Larson oozes charm as the wisecracking action heroine who's always looking for trouble, yet is also believably emotional as she tries to piece together her past (which gives us a variation on the superhero origin movie formula). The supporting cast is strong, Goose the cat is predictably adorable, there's tons of 90's nostalgia (and music!), and all in all it's more than enough for an entertaining 2 hours at the movies. Bonus points: lovely Stan Lee tribute in the beginning, and a post-credits scene that should make everyone even more hyped up for Avengers: Endgame (if possible).",1
1849,"I thought the movie was just fine. There is alot of hate towards Brie Larson, but I found her quite charming. The action and special effects were decent enough.The ""girls can be heroes too!!!"" and 90s references were sometimes a wee bit heavy handed, but not enough to hinder the movie.All in all? Time and money well spent, but not in the top tier of comic book movies.",1
1850,"This movie is really great, only the anti-feminist butt-hurt boys that are really common on the internet nowadays that make a collective-personal witch hunt on these movies because their anti-feminism agenda; are the ones destroying the reviews. This is probably in the top 5 Marvel movies, it is great. Brie Larson may be a strange person out of the screen but inside the screen she has charisma, lovability and awesome acting skills. She did an incredible job as Carol Denvers. A must watch. You have Spider man, Iron Man, Ant man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, man, man, man etc, etc... Then they release a 1 title very focused on a woman. Male public TRIGGERED..., start collective witch hunt and destroys reviews. C'mon boys, grow up, this movie is amazing.",1
1851,"Weak writing but perfect casting, with Brie Larson fitting the part about as good as you could possibly expect someone to.",1
1852,This movie tells well an origin of a very controversial character in comic book. Brie Larson is beautiful and wonderful in the movie. The universe created around the characters is incredible and it is a fun movie.,1
1853,"This is a good Marvel flick, much like Thor Ragnarok or Captain America, however they seem to keep dumbing down the plots to kindergarten level, that is alarming. More so because the movies keep exceeding the 90 minute mark by a long shot, and yet not much happens. Brie Larson is a very good cast, in direct contrast with Gal Gadot, and the movie makes use of super powers once and for all, that was great. Hopefully sequels will have more depth, but this is female super hero done right.",1
1854,"The marketing surrounding Marvel Studio's Captain Marvel, leading up to its release, hyped an effects-driven spectacle focused on an unassumingly powerful lead-actress promising to go higher, further and faster. And on those expectations, Captain Marvel mostly follows through and only falls short when directly compared to its MCU brethren and other superhero titans like DC's Wonder Woman.The film opens with a flashback montage disguised as a bad dream of Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) containing scenes and dialogue begging the audience to ask questions like: who is she? Where is she from? What is her role in this universe? And as audience members, we unfortunately already know the answers to all of these questions: Carol Danvers. Earth. She's going to whoop Thanos' ass. But the film proceeds as if we don't already know this. Once we put those questions aside, we are properly introduced to Danvers in a sparring (both physical and verbal) session with Jude Law's Yon-Rogg, the leader of her Kree military unit. In this sequence, we get a brief view into the conflict that is supposed to frame the rest of the movie: Danvers is plagued by an identity crisis beset by amnesia and others constantly convincing her to not embrace her true self and place limits (both physical and metaphorical) on herself. Shortly after this, a military operation goes awry, and Danvers is captured by the devious Skrull militants and is spirited away to Earth where the real plot and our protagonist's hero's journey begins.The 90s aesthetic of the film is hit and miss. I found myself bobbing my head to familiar 90s rock and pop anthems throughout, but felt a twinge of nausea when I saw my third separate era-appropriate band t-shirt. But besides rock music and flannel, the world feels a legitimate MCU analog to the real-world's grunge era. Radio dials and payphones flank scenes with experimental Quinjets and SHIELD operatives. Many have praised the de-aging of Sam Jackson's Nick Fury and for good reason: you'd be hard-pressed to spot the difference between this version of SLJ and his appearance in Goodfellas. The only visual shortcomings arrive during the heavy action sequences. With a character who can fly, create energy blasts, and rock a gravity-defying mohawk, this movie deserved top-notch CGI; what we get is dicey visuals with often floaty looking characters resembling videogame avatars. All in all, the visuals neither make or break this movie. Fortunately, this film shines when the characters stop punching and brooding and start talking to each other.There is a buddy cop aspect between Larson and Jackson that pleases mostly, with Jackson shouldering most of that load. Even Larson's brief interaction with a rent-a-cop dishes out a couple of good laughs. But the best pairings come late in the game between Larson and two supporting characters played by Lashana Lynch and Ben Mendelsohn. The former relationship represents a forgotten past with Lynch playing ex-fighter pilot Maria Rambeau who both Danvers' best friend and a key figure in rediscovering her lost memories. The chemistry between the two actresses allows the movie true sentiment and creates a reason to finally root for our main character. It's slightly disappointing that the film didn't capitalize more so on this dynamic. The latter of the aforementioned relationships represents Danvers' future and ascension to heroism. Mendelsohn plays a wartorn Skrull who is revealed to be not a terrorist but refugee seeking a new home for his displaced people. This is a refreshing take on both the comic book lore and the actor's range; it's great to see Mendelsohn in a role that evokes compassion rather than hate. It's with these interpersonal exploits that the movie ultimately allows Larson to bring her character to life so to speak and instill confidence in a future with this franchise.By the end of the film, the audience gets a mixed bag of surprises and familiar ground; exciting and underwhelming scenes. The film does bookend itself with impressive and fun action while allowing characters to drive most of 2 hour and 5 minute run-time. Although, ultimately, this film does fall slightly short on its claim to go higher, further and faster than its competitors, the real reward to the fans is the resonance of Captain Marvel's personal relationships and the promise that her character will be a badass, but will also offer an empathetic presence among a laundry list of ego-centric superheroes paving the way for a variety of narrative to come.",1
1855,"Good introduction movie without spending too much time on her origin. There was a lot of controversy surround this movie for the wrong reasons which I won't cover as it's not warranted. Whilst not an A lister in the Marvel Comics up until the last decade, Captain Marvel has succeeded in being the real first Phase 4 movie even tho it really isn't a Phase 4 movie because it's a few months before Avengers: Endgame. But the main point is that the MCU now has it's new Iron Man + Capt America combo character that can lead the New Avengers post Endgame.The twists in the movie were good, because they were unexpected but still provide an opportunity for a Secret Invasion arc in a few years. The way the Kree, and Skrull war was set up in the trailers was very different in the movie. Having Nick Fury, and Agent Coulson was nice but I did feel sad that Fury was basically comic relief in the movie.Onward to Avengers: Endgame!",1
1856,"Captain Marvel éum bom filme, refrescante que apresenta muito bem a história de Carol Danvers. A actriz fica otima no papel e o filme tem variadissimas cenas engraçadas. Não gostei muito do vilão mas o filme em sim está muito bem conseguido.",1
1857,"Apenas apaixonado por esse filme. Obrigado por tudo, Brie Larson. E vem logo incomodar novamente com seu talento em Avengers: Endgame.",1
1858,"This was a marvel origin story through and through. It did exactly what you expected and did it well like the other origin stories from Marvel. While I wouldn't say it was my favourite movie or even favourite marvel movie to date it was definitely worth a watch. It filled in a few things from MCU past, had some fun characters, and was a generally enjoyable watch overall.",1
1859,"A fun, albeit unspectacular first outing for Captain Marvel. The script is this film's ultimate failing, but Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury brings in enough humor to make it worth a watch.",1
1861,"Captain Marvel was a good addition to the MCU. Brie Larson gives a sometimes bland but overall good performance. Her characters backstory is interesting and how it develops into the ending of the movie was cool to see. The action is sometimes weak, the worst probably of recent years in the MCU. But overall its still a decent movie that is worth watching if you like superhero movies.",1
1862,Es bastante entretenida y para ser la película introductoria de  Captain Marvel está aceptable pero cuando comparas con otras como Spider-Man Homecoming o Black Panther se queda bastante corta. Además q carece de emocionantes y épicas escenas de acción como otras películas  de marvel,1
1865,"Can't help you if you don't like this movie, you're missing out on great film.",1
1867,"If you just look at the user score you would think this was a bad movie. Far from it!Billion dollar world wide success! This was excellent fun. Can't wait to share this with my children.Watching and reading other ""haters reviews"" the only reason they could muster was them not liking a female superhero.",1
1868,"O filme é muito bom, engraçado em alguma situações e o gato goose é o melhor personagem do filme, mas eu não gostei da ação do filme muito fraca e o jeito que o nick fury perde o olho, ridiculo. mas ainda assim vale a pena assistir.",1
1870,"You know, I think this movie is getting a lot of undeserved hate . I mean sure, it’s pretty different for a marvel movie, but it’s definitely not as bad as The Dark World, Avengers 2, or Ant-Man and the Wasp. Keep in mind, I do acknowledge the film’s problems. Captain Marvel, as a character, is generally uninteresting , although Brie Larson did try to make it work. Also, the plot gets kinda messy every now and then. I think the Skrull and Nick Fury were actually some of the better characters in this movie . Also, Jude Law did a solid job as one of the antagonists. Comparing Captain MArvel to other newly released films, such as Hellboy 2019, I’d say it’s one the better movies. Although it isn’t as good as Shazam. Walking out of the theater, I felt like I watched one of JJ Abrams Star Trek movies. Mostly because JJ’s take on Star Trek was good, but it didn’t really feel like Star Trek. Captain Marvel didn’t really feel like the traditional marvel movie, and that’s ok with me. Ever since Infinity War came out, it seems as if Marvel has went in a more serious direction. Like how the avengers and others struggled with their connections and emotions, and how they handled them. Captain Marvel is basically a glimpse at what phase 4 of Marvel will be. Not everything will be about fighting, sometimes a person greatest enemy is themselves, that sort of thing. Combine that with good actors and ambitious directors, I believe Captain Marvel is setting us up for something really exciting, and I don’t just mean Endgame. 7/10 you guys are just salty.",1
1871,"Now I am not much for pandering, and this movie could have done just fine with out it. CM does a good job in the action department but lacks in the character it self. The flash backs for what C.Marvel had for modivation didnt consist of the suffering as a soldier but as a girl growing up in the 90s. Most of flash back was just awful of the tired out ""girls cant do ___,"" which used only 1 group of specific people to portray Carol's past of being a victim. It felt shallow and unnecessary to add those scenes and more insulting that they were all white men. We all suffered from bullying from various people, but the director specifically focused on that and it's obvious it was for pandering purposes. Felt insulting to anyone who wasnt a privilege white girl.",1
1872,"i don’t think it’s a 10 movie, but you made me do that bc it doesn’t deserve 3.5",1
1873,"How the hell did she get oscars. She's awful, monotone acting and will never be if she don't start to learn proper acting again. But i also blame the directors for poor direction and poor writing.Oh yeah subtle feminist agenda",0
1874,It was okay and I enjoyed it. The film wasn't as pandering to feminists as the marketing material it had a good plot twost but if the writers pulled a reverse Metal Gear Solid 3 (if you will) I would have enjoyed it more and it would keep fans anticipated forEndgame because Skrull Theorys.,1
1875,"Captain Marvel is the 21st movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It starred Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Vers/Captain Marvel, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Jude Law as Yon-Rogg and more casts. The story started in 1995 on the Kree Empire's capital planet of Hala, Vers had nightmares. To be honest, it wasn't a good beginning but it wasn't forgettable. Next scenes were quite forgettable because they showed nothing special so I couldn't remember much of it. I could remember when she met Fury with 2 agents at the Blockbuster Video shop (wasn't it? I can't remember). When she was captured by Talos and other Skrulls, we were fooled by the movie (we though the Skrulls were villains). They tried to change Vers' memory (surely that could be remembered by most people, I think). The others scene till the end of the movie was not bad but a few people could remember many. The story plot was not bad at all. Started in a planet, a young woman trying to find out who she was and took a lot of risks to restore her memory, surely audiences from the 90s would like that but for me, it was medium like a 7.5/10. Bet the 90s would like it more than I do. Brie Larson was set to be the main character in this movie. But unfortunately, she didn't try her best to prove that Carol Danvers (or Vers) was main in here. I know she could do a lot better like in Room (2015), she won Best Actress. But in here, the MCU didn't take this movie seriously enough to make Carol the main character. However, they did some marvelous CGI effects of Vers' powers and others. They were quite like real with no mistakes. The final battle was thrilling, full with power beams and other CGI, nothing was bad and I was actually impressed. The right thing they did was to add humor to the movie. Luckily, there was Samuel L. Jackson, so things went okay! (also with Goose the 'cat') Even though there were hilarious scenes, I laughed a little and I think they should do more. While watching the movie, I was bored for some time like in conversations, for example. They were really boring but to make things impressive, they did a lot better at the end even though the fight scenes weren't that epic. So to summarize this, I would like to say that Captain Marvel (2019) isn't one of the greatest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it was funny, entertaining (at the end) but I bet the audiences of the 21st century wouldn't like it. Sorry Larson, the movie was fine but you didn't try your best in here!Points from me: 7.3/10",1
1876,"Funny,enjoyable and worth watching. Brie Larson gives a heart as Carol Danvers and Samuel L. Jackson is soooo good. Love it!",1
1877,Solid addition to the MCU.  Easily on par with others.  Brie Larson was great.  I did feel the humor missed at times.  Worth a watch.,1
1878,"When you see that a movie bothers a class of fragile white men when they see a woman with power, perhaps becoming the leader of the Avengers, you soon realize that the film has exceeded expectations! Great movie!",1
1880,"'Captain Marvel' was a controversial movie from the start and is quite an important film for Marvel. However, the plot was a bit mediocre and the plot twist was rushed in favour of a large fight scene at the end. Overall, a good movie, though one that felt out of place in between the two blockbusters that were the Avengers' movies.",1
1881,It was way better than what everyone has said ...I really enjoyed and looking forward for Captain Marvel 2 ,1
1882,Great addition to the Marvel Universe. Ties in to other movies or great as a stand alone.,1
1883,"Captain Marvel doesnt do anything to blow you away. Sure it lacks some of the aspects that some of the best mcu movies have, however it has the humor and action. Overall Captain Marvel is a fun ride that I enjoyed.",1
1885,"This film is the simple of the heroes movies. That's no bad, the relationship of the caracters is funny, Brie Larsson just do it and actually she's killed it. Samuel and the cat are awsome and they show what we wanna see.",1
1886,"Yes it's worth seeing. A good Marvel origins movie for multiple characters, including: Captain Mar Vel (of course), Nicholas Joseph Fury, Agent Colson ""Rook"", Ronin the Accuser and his sidekick Korath, to name a few. I feel the movie was entertaining and provided a good mix of action, comedy and drama.",1
1887,"Fantastic start to Captain Marvels story, sure to expand over a trilogy and subsequent ensemble films. Great 90s nostalgia vibe (I know the soundtrack wasn't as well received as the GotG song choices but CM has a solid selection, very appropriate to the era, and let's face it, the 90s was hardly the golden era of music. Good selection all the same). Some fantastic fights, particularly the scene where Carol fights while sprinting through a Skrull ship with her hands trapped and no shoes on! It was comedic but also very well executed, a brawly sort of fight which highlights her impulsive nature but also her brute strength (and this is before she reaches peak-power!). The ""flash-back/dream sequence"" was very cleverly executed, I liked how Marvel chose to break from their usual linear storytelling and instead Carol's ""origin story"" plays out backwards (we meet a high-powered amnesiac ""Vers"" and we work backwards to unravel the mystery of where Carol has come from and who she is. It was an interesting change and well executed in my opinion). The supporting cast are all marvellous, Fury, Coulson, Maria & Monica, Goose, Yon-Rogg and Talos all deliver solid performances. Despite the vocal minority of dissenters, Carol lives up to her hashtag and smashed into cinemas #HigherFurtherFaster than many of her MCU colleagues, breaking $1billion in the box off in the blink of an eye. Well earned and I'm looking forward to seeing her character grow.",1
1888,"One more Captain has arrivedYeah it was something like an empty slot between the lifetime of Captain America and the main events where all the Avengers are involved. And here we go, back to 1995, to introduce Ms Captain. Mar-Vel, a superlady with a curious lifepath, full of misteries and amnesia.Pros. The movie is doing its job as a prequel pretty well. It adds a chunk of prehistory to the Marvel Universe. You can see the connection with the Gardians of the Galaxy, Thor and of course it tells a lot about S.H.I.E.L.D.Talking about SHIELD. Samuel L Jaekson is absolutely awesome! His young character is so well performed, thanks to makeup team and the actor himself. It's very interesting to see Nick Fury's early age, young and less experienced.Lol. The Captain Marvel throws few jokes, which are actually not bad. Many characters can make you if not laugh, but at list smile or grin for sure. And it feels much better than when all the funny part accumulated in one person. Being too serious about what's going on is the worst enemy of superhero movies. Along with a lack of a good plot of course.The scenario is ok. It is interesting to watch, and even there are few surprises in it. It is a good thing when a movie can break your expectations a little bit.Cons. The acting part. Particularly, Brie Larson and Jude Law. It is not like too bad.. But I just don't see those roles suit them. Brie makes me believe she is a girl from Earth, but I don't know... Maybe lack of charisma, or something else do not let me see her as a right Captain Marvel. With Jude Law it is even harder. Noone can tell he is not charismatic. But I just don't see him in fantastic genre at all.The battles. Somebody behind the scenes give some help for the good guys. Seriously, why not to give more natural look to all those fights. Why antagonists prefer talking instead of trying to kill when they have a chance? Agh.Anyway. Still if you are a Marvel fan, you should watch it. I find it somewhere in the middle between good and bad.",1
1889,"Captain Marvel is by far one of the best origins story films released by the MCU, alongside Black Panther and a few classics. All the controversy surrounding this film is truly just background noise. Let the film speak for itself. The dynamic between Carol and Fury is entertaining, the story itself is engaging, and there’s a cute cat (always a bonus). This film is not only a story about Captain Marvel but a story about the avengers, Nick Fury, and the Kree. It provides context for all other films in the MCU and is undoubtedly an important film to watch if you plan on seeing other Marvel films in the future. I’ve heard people describe Carol as emotionless, but I struggle to see where exactly in the film she is being emotionless. She’s a soldier trying to follow her orders, but the film is about her overcoming barriers and following her heart while also learning the extent of her power. Overall, I would say I enjoyed everything about the film. The 90s set pieces, the beautiful CGI that was added to the fight scenes, the story, and the acting itself. An absolute must-see.",1
1890,Not sure why this got low scores. I loved it. I really liked this hero. I hope to see more.,1
1891,Very enjoyable movie. Although not most people agree I thought Brie Larson did a great job at playing Carol.,1
1892,"Me surpreendeu, ficou acima do esperado, a capitã é muito carismática e divertida, além de ser incrivelmente forte. Adorei!",1
1893,"Imperfect as a film. All-powerful as a hero. Captain Marvel sets out to bring the MCU into clearer skies, past the turbulence that is Thanos, and onto the next chapter.",1
1894,"Pretty good movie, good humor and action. I liked the characters and the story was well made. Some minor flaws but nothing to cry about, all the hate seem to be more personal then movie based so I would recommend ignoring it.",1
1895,This is hands down my favorite MCU movie. The only movie (not just MCU) I have ever went to see twice in theaters and any chance I get I see it again. Brie Larson is absolutely brilliant here.,1
1896,"Captain Marvel is the new arguable marvel movie that follows Carol Danvers as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races.Captain Marvel was actually a fun ride as any marvel movie before; it builds a great origin story for its lead character. If you’re looking to be entertained this is your movie, featuring some good action sequences and Brie Larson in her full badass mode. The fight sequences lacked in some scenes, they weren’t memorable like other marvel movies. I understand that when you have a character as powerful as Carol Danvers in your movie, you might face some difficulties in that aspect. Plus, from a technical perspective there are scenes where you really can’t identify who’s fighting who due to the color aspect and CGI which was buggy. The CGI de-aging tech used on Clark Gregg and Samuel L. Jackson was incredible too! One of the best parts of the movie was Talos played by Ben Mendelsohn who really stole the show with his amazing performance and his important role in the movie, and Goose the cat which is outstanding and very funny at times. The chemistry between Sameul L. Jackson and Brie Larson was perfect, one of the best buddy cop relationships. Looking forward to seeing them on screen together in the future!The story of the movie took some turns and featured some insane plot twists. It did feel like a Memento-Christopher Nolan movie in some scenes which failed miserably. It is very risky when a character tries to recover their memories and past in films. When a lead character is lost in the movie and their backstory takes too much time to uncover, then viewers would definitely be lost too! As for Carol Danvers’s character,she was a born bad-ass! But, in almost all MCU movies we see our characters face difficulties in their starting days like Captain America, Iron Man, and Black Panther. All these characters went through a lot to reach there full potentials. But, I can understand that Carol is a very powerful character and it’s very hard to write her better than that. In addition, Captain Marvel doesn’t fail in its core. Marvel succeeds in building an inspiring and interesting character and Captain Marvel broadens the MCU’s history in a very unique way. Now, I’m really hyped to see Brie Larson reprise her role as Carol in Avengers: Endgame, as the movie didn’t impact her character’s purpose in any way.The music in the movie gave us the 90s feel, and I didn’t think any song was out of place. The soundtrack influenced the movie’s time period and action scenes.So, we recommend you to go check out Captain Marvel and to form your own opinion. Do not let other haters/critics affect yours!",1
1898,"Boooring. The lead actor, Brie Larson is a terrible, uncharismatic super-hero. This is actually the first female superhero, from Marvel that I would prefer to never see again.",0
1899,"I enjoyed this film, and found it entertaining. CGI was good. Brie looks great and she acted professionally, but perhaps she needed a bit more charismatic dialogue. Samuel L Jackson, always great. ",1
1900,Captain Marvel presents to us a fun and powerful cosmic adventure that perfectly de-aged Samuel L. Jackson as the buddy and sidekick for our snarky space lady. This is one of the much more intriguing origin stories that the mcu has given us with a nicer and less typical portrayal of the skrulls.,1
1901,"I actually liked the movie. But only by imagining she would fight the real bad guys.And in the real world that would mean the actress would fight herself and the filmmakers.So of course this means most of the work was done by my brain and not the filmmakers.So it only gets a 3.In Endgame it wasnt possible to run this self-deception about her anymore, because she completely ticked out, as if it was a completely different character all of the sudden... as if she was put into a cage for 3 years and treated horribly by her captors and of course completely invulnerable and more powerful than EVERY super hero combined. Just unbelievably silly. Even She-Ra and He-Man has more weaknesses than her, and more importantly, they were much more human-like, not like a robot trying to indoctrinate people (actually mostly children, which is even worse) with SJW fascism. And after seeing interviews with the actress, it completely destroyed that self deception, when seeing the movie again. Even her coworkers dont seem to like her much.",0
1902,Did Kathleen Kennedy work on this movie??? Another movie lecturing us about politics .. boo,0
1904,Just an other crappy super hero movie in which the heroine’s greatest accomplishment is getting super powers by standing near an exploding engine.,0
1905,"The absolute state of this movie.I didn't have high hopes going in, but I thought I'd give it a fair shake. Maybe it was more than a paean to pretty white girl power, right?  Maybe they just made a fun popcorn movie, or perhaps it explores some original tropes. Conceivably it might even feature the high quality of acting of which Oscar winner Brie Larson (real name Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers) is apparently capable (although I'm informed that her previous movies are Not Made For Me, so I haven't seen any).Nope. A big, flat-assed nope.It's cringe from start to finish.  Larson (real name Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers) has a blank expression on her face which is intended to convey... what?  I have no idea.  That she's bored with the whole thing? Well, me too. The few brief scenes where she changes that expression just highlight that she's got her Resting Bored Face on for the entirity of the rest of the movie.She's not interesting, she's not appealling, she's brings no depth or complexity or even personality to the character.And as the movie is entirely about her, what does that leave us?The score and cinematography, which is pedestrian.  The CGI which is frankly shoddy, although even CGI-Jackson acts Larson (real name Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers) off the screen.  Mind you, so does the cat.The pacing is all over the place, both plodding and rushed.  It feels like a much longer movie than it actually is.  The last twentyu minutes is the most tolerable, but in terms of character development, it's simply super-powered pretty white girl becomes SUPER super-powered pretty white girl.  But we're given no reason to care.There are a few clumsy stabs at The Patriarchy, but not enough to condemn it purely on that basis.  No, I condemn it because it's a dull, poorly written, badly made and disastrously cast movie.You know what I was thinking of all the way through this disaster?  Howard the Duck.  How I'd rather be watching Howard the Duck.  Weird, but true.",0
1906,Could of been really good if it wasn't for all the sjw garbage. Last quarter is pure feminist propaganda.,0
1908,I suppose Goose is the most interesting character in the uninspired flick. Goose is a f*cking can fyi.,0
1909,The worst of Marvel movies... I was excited that this hero will receive film... But this is just no good. And for me this film never existed.,0
1915,"They made a character with no real weakness who spends the entire movie as an expressionless hero with no charisma. I was so bored during this movie. By the time the pace FINALLY picked back up near the end, it was too little too late. This entirely forgettable entry into this massive film franchise is completely skippable. You won't need to see this to understand what's going on in Endgame. Yes, there will be this new Captain Marvel character in Endgame, but all you really need to know is that she existed back in the 90's and finds her way back to the action ""in the nick of time"" once Endgame rolls around. One thing to note: Your experience of the MCU as a whole may be lessened if you see this movie or accept this movie as canon. They literally retconned Captain Marvel as the BEGINNING of the Avengers, as well as the battle for control of a certain macguffin that was central to phase 1 marvel's climax. They also introduce a plotline where there's little reason for the Kree to have largely ignored Earth all this time since the 90's. This is a pretty big plothole.How does this rank compared to the rest of the MCU? It's right at the bottom; near but below Thor the Dark World and Iron Man 2. If Thor 2 and Iron Man 2 are both 2/5 stars, this one is 1.5/5 stars.",0
1919,"The movie is badly let down by casting Brie Larson in the lead. She just doesn't have it, any of it. A poor actor with no charisma, anti-charisma if anything, especially with the fem message to be delivered. She's not especially spectacular facially or physically either. Bar her, it was an OK movie to watch on TV.",0
1920,You know how when you smoke a cigar you get that turd-like taste in your mouth?  That was this film.  It's a real **** sandwich.,0
1921,"I had super low expectations but wow, another awful movie. I liked Avengers so thought maybe this one may be ok. Worst Marvel movie ever made.  Brie was not a poor cast and her character ruined it for me. The whole Girl Power which semester to be hollywood snow thing, is just killing me and I am a female! Her over confidence , constant smirks and joking around just threw me off.1. The music...they play  I’m just a Girl by Gwen Stefani!!!!! U kidding me? How horrific! Who is directing this? They should be fired. 2. The constant attempt at jokes just which didn’t and  doesn’t work3. Brie’s one dimensional acting and inability to show emotions just ruined this powerful character!  That’s also the director she fault, they should see that she can’t deliver on screen and have her fix it. 4. At some point Brie realized she can fly!!! And screams and yells  Yay..whoohooo as she going through rocks and punching space shuttles! What we we 5 yrs old?5. The feminism is just way too forced! Hollywood please stop pushing this down on us. It’s too much, you are ruining movies with it!! Just stop.Movie is soooo weak. I will not see a second one with her in it.",0
1923,"Fun superhero movie done in the usual Marvel style - looks good visually, has the right balance of action, humor and drama, hard to find anyhing not to like about it. Maybe one thing: there's no real explanation of how she gets to the level of power she has in the end. I know many comicbooky ""explanations"" of these things are pretty stupid, but they're almost always better that no explanation at all. So 1 point lost for that. And ofc 1 point lost for being a popcorn-movie and not having the kind of depth and character development some other superhero shows have shown possible (Unbreakable or  Jessica Jones the series).As already noted by others, the man-babies are already all over this one, trashing its rating like that's going to make a difference. I think many of us have already learned to give even more attention to these not-white-male-glorifying shows if they end up having obviously manipulated low ratings like this - it's becoming a positive sign in itself. :))",1
1925,"There is nothing indicating, that she is any good in a kitchen. She's not a looker and her personality is garbage. Nothing interesting for a proper white male here.",0
1926,Wow this is very very bad...another load of forced lady slime...need to stop trying to make 1 film for everyone and specialize its not working it never works just makes everyone unhappy,0
1930,"Absolutely weakest of all movies from the serie. Brie Larson as Captain is emotionless, flat character that is just unlikable. How did this sunk so low?",0
1931,A great movie to build up for Endgame. Samuel L Jackson’s performance was brilliant. Captain Marvel has twists no one could expect.,1
1932,I have seen a lot of superheroes movies both from Marvel and DC (I prefer DC) and they are average at most. But this one is absolutely the best superhero movie I have ever seen. There wasn't a single second I was bored. This was pure enjoyment from start to end. What was dissapoointing is that in the Endgame she was max 10 minutes. I hope Captain Marvel 2 will be as great as this one is.,1
1933,"A boring mess, felt like i was watching the green lantern movie.Marvel have made amazing movies and horrible stinkers and this one really takes the spot.It was even worse than Thor: The Dark World or whatever it was called.",0
1935,"Not a great movie. Samuel L Jackson was quite good in it. Really silly ending ""explaining"" a very stupid reason for something about his character but that's not Samuel's fault. The blonde woman, shes wooden and smug and not very good. I hope this Captain Marvel character doesn't pull the next Avengers movie down as she isn't interesting and the actress isn't good.",0
1937,"""I've had better nightmares."".( 71/100 ).No hay mucho que discutir de Captain Marvel con Brie Larson como protagonista. Carol Denvers es parte de un fuerza militar élite Kree en la que Yon-Rogg, interpretado por Jude Law, ayuda a Carol a controlar sus poderes e impulsos y, al mismo tiempo, es entrenada para luchar una guerra en contra de los Skrulls. Pero una misión en el planeta Tierra, que provoca misterios y revelaciones, ayuda a Carol a descubrir su verdadero ser y poder. Al igual que todas o la mayoría de las peliculas del MCU, no hay un impulso dramático muy importante o que valga la pena. En cuestión de la historia, me atrevería a decir que es una de las películas más monótonas que recuerdo de Marvel. Su error está en que trata de sensibilizar al público en temas que conocemos muy poco y, al mismo tiempo, lo hace de forma muy diplomática. Esta es una película algo política con un discurso de inclusión con el que el público no podrá empatizar adecuadamente; no por la falta de valor en el mensaje, sino por la falta de trasfondo y lo que ignora la protagonista y, con ella, el público. Irónicamente, eso ayuda a que la moraleja reluzca y, cuando es necesario, crear intensidad emocional. La película tiene éxito en mostrar a un personaje que es fuerte por ser humano y no por sus poderes habilidades. Visualmente no es la película más espectacular de Marvel, incluso si omitimos las películas de Avengers y la música, compuesta por Pinar Toprak, resalta y apoya un poco la emotividad en el proyecto. Si me gustó más de lo que me gustaría aceptar es por la misma moraleja y que Larson la personifica con seguridad, autoconfianza e individualidad, valores con los que me identifico plenamente pero que, desafortunadamente, no se construyen bien en Captain Marvel.-There's not a lot to discuss of Captain Marvel with Brie Larson as the protagonist. Carol Denvers is part of a Kree military elite force in which Yon-Rogg, played by Jude Law, helps Carol to manage her powers and impulses and, at the same time, is trained to fight a war against the Skrulls. But a mission on planet Earth, that brings into light mysteries and revelations, helps Carol to discover her true self and power. Just as all or most of the MCU movies, there's not a very important or worthy dramatic impulse. Talking about the story, I would dare to say this is one of the most monotone movies of Marvel that I can recall. Its mistake it's in how it tries to sensitize the public in topics we know little and, at the same time, it does it in a very diplomatic way. This is a kind of politic film with a speech about inclusion with which the public won't be able to empathize properly; not because of the lack of value in the moral, but because of the lack of background and what the main character and, with her, the public. Ironically, that helps the moral to shine and, when it's necessary, create emotional intensity. The movie succeeds in showing a strong character because of being human and not because of her powers and abilities. Visually it's not the most spectacular movie of Marvel, even if we omit the Avengers movies and the music, composed by Pinar Toprak, highlights and supports a little the emotivity in the project. If I liked it more than what I would like to accept is because the same moral and that Larson personifies it with security, self-confidence, and individuality, values with which I fully relate but, unfortunately, are not well built in Captain Marvel.",1
1939,"Some one told me that this movie is bad but i don't think so ! It's quite good, i enjoyed it",1

Captain marvel herself didn’t pull her part unfortunately with lacluster acting and emotions rarely having any convincing part in the overall plot. Would prefer that all Brie’s SJW politics was left outside the entertainment of a pleasant action flick. Rumours are she will be edited out from End Game which I wouldn’t be to sad about and recasting her as CM wouldn’t hurt either.Please dont do a Last Jedi/Han Solo with the MCU Disney...",0
1948,"Wow a lot of butthurt white males crying all over the comments. This movie is soo good, too bad its getting all this hate because they couldn't understand what Brie Larsson truly meant..",1
1949,Nothing good about this movie. larson sucks. big skip. marvel shouldnt make this pointless movie,0
1951,"If you watch this movie and go out thinking is ""another Marvel movie"" please came back and watch it again, because you have lost very important details. It's amazing and sensitive in so many forms! Also, have good action and visual effects, but you know, in the Marvel level.",1
1952,"A generic hero movie that would have flopped completely were it not released the current PC climate. If you want to see a convincing portrayal of strong women played by good actresses watch ""The Good Fight"".",0
1953,"This is the most dull movie of all times, I've fell asleep twice while watching it, and I watched it at 11am, after sleeping for 9 hours the night before! Really no need to further explain since I will be repeating what so many already said, but this movie is basically everything wrong with the entertainment industry today - pushing fake agendas and pretending they care about them. All in all, the SJW approach kinda could destroy he superhero genre if they continue like this and I'm not sure how much tickets can Disney keep buying and showing it as actual people went and watched the movie, so pathetic, as is the movie.",0
1955,La peor pelicula de la historia de marvel hecha solo para quedar bien con todo el mundo y todo vale para contentar a unos yel rwsto que lo acepte si o si.,0
1958,"Its not the worsted thing i ever watched but the Movie is just ""Meh"". It is boring for most of its Run-Time. I seriously dont understand who thought that an overpowered Character with no real weakness is a great Main Protagonist. Captain Marvel is unlikable and an **** But it isnt 100% the Actresses fault because also in the Comics Cap. marvel is totally unlikable. The Movie just starts and Ends after 2 Hours. There is nothing you can care for, no emotion just another bland Superhero movie nobody will Remember. You can actually have Fun with this Movie but just don't expect too much.",0
1959,"As a Marvel movie, it's watchable, and there are some good moments in it. The trademark Marvel humor is there and the special effects are decent. However, the worst part of this movie is Captain Marvel. She's arrogant, unrelatable, and has no character arc whatsoever. In other Marvel movies, the hero has THAT moment of humbleness and humility that turns them into a hero. There is no such moment for Captain Marvel. Apparently she has always been an awesome person and becomes even more awesome once she realizes that she's being held back from her full potential. I miss Tony Stark already...",0
1963,I couldn't believe what i was seeing! The disappointment level was over 9000! The plot sucked. The jokes were sad. The story line really felt terrible. Im just going to stay alone for the next couple of hours.. I wish i could get back the time i spent.. :'(,0
1964,"Main character is kind of cold and smug and hard for me to relate to as a female. I like a girl who kicks ass, but she comes off as a bit of a villain. Shes 1 dimensional and it really upsetting to me because It was so close to being super cool.",0
1965,"The films starts with showing that a woman can beat a man and is fully mentally like a man. Applausing commentlessly. There is no clear plot in this film, everything begins out of nowhere without any explanation about what is going on. Low quality CGI which I didn't expect in a Marvel-produced film, pointless dialogues, impossible to watch.",0
1966,"this film pulls down the bases of what was previously raised in avengers 2012 and there they tell us that humanity knew of the existence of extraterrestrials thanks to thor but then everyone forgot the scrull, also this actress is antipathetic but not able",0
1967,"So many mentioned that Larson's performance is expressionless... I would've taken expressionless, it could've even contributed to a character under some ""alien"" influence, over that stupid, smug face. Whenever she encounters an ""obstacle"", which is always a breeze and hardly inconveniences her, she wears this condescending smirk. You can almost tell she's imagining how the target is a 40 year old white dude.",0
1969,"Don't know how to play it, not working. Tried though showbox ...bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",0
1971,Sad overall not great very boring. Didn’t seem to have much meaning to any one or anything,0
1972,This was the most disappointing Marvel movie in the entire franchise history. The best part of the movie is the 90’s theme. The worst part is everything else. The antagonist story sucks.,0
1973,"Here is a note for future superhero movies, there is a character arc that is needed to have a successful heroes journey.  Superpowered warrior to superpowered amnesiac is not a character arc it is flatline.  The adversity here is her amnesia?  The Kree, her people?  Its a muddled mess with a clear pro immigration agenda not paying tribute to anything in the comics and conflates the original hero (Mar-Vell) with Yon-Rogg (villain) that makes any semblance of a story unrecognizable.  If you want flashy things going bang then go to a fireworks show, a movie is supposed to be about story and this has a disjointed mess with an unlikeable star.  Its a shame because she was likeable in Community and playing a quirky, nerdy girl seems to be her main talent pool-she should have been squirrel girl not Captain Marvel.  Someone thought Marvel movies were about explosions and flashy effects when they were missing the real character flaws, acting ability and charm movies need to be successful",0
1974,"I honestly watched this expecting it to be a seat squirming, slow motion car crash of an experience (but you know, make the effort it's MCU cannon and I should probably watch this before end game).It was actually very watchable, yes it has about 45 seconds of the equivalent of female gillette advert thrown in twice, which was excessive and unnecessary. But story wise and acting wise it was good (certainly towers over DC's wonder woman), I'd have preferred Brie Larson to have payed the part a bit more starkly authoritarian, to aid the future dynamics of MCU, but I suspect the intention was to make her character more relatable even if this meant deviating from the source material, ""shoot first ask question later"" nature.Finally this film is no where near as WOKE as it's detractors would have you believe.",1
1976,This movie was utter trash it was filled with fourth wave feminist propaganda and also the writing and the direction of the film fell flat no character development with Carol Danvers at all. This is by far the worst Marvel movie in the MCU due to Disney only pushing for a woke agenda instead of making a good film like they used to the past 10 years. Brie Larson is bad as an actress in this film.,0
1978,Fallout new Vegas how to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a,0
1979,Marvel makes films worse and worse every year. Take the spiderman from them.,0
1981,"Brie Larson can't play, one face in all movie, and it's so boring that make people fall asleep.",0
1982,"Probably the worst MCU film I've seen. Brie Larson has as much charisma in this film as a cardboard box that was used to ship the script to her. The supporting cast diid well to try lift the film from the terrible performance of a leading lady that obviously didn't want to do this film, because the target material for this film so obviously doesn't play to the demographic that she wants to do films for, It is obvious Brie Larson had no interest in Marvel Comics and the MCU before this film and it shows in her performance. If you compare this to Wonder Woman, which quite frankly is seriously a much better film in every way, where Gal Gadot embraced the character and source material and made an excellent movie. If Brie Larson's Captain Marvel is the future of the MCU then the future is bleak, mediocre films, plots and wooden performances will ruin a franchise that has been developed over the last decade or so. Brie Larson has made this version of Captain Marvel less likeable than Ebola both on an off the screen. The best thing Marvel and Disney can do to prevent the impending train wreck is a subtle last minute rewrite to the end Avengers Endgame where Brie Larson's Captain Marvel is replaced with actress that actually can act and has a likeable personality.",0
1983,"It is good start for captain marvel in MCU! the story was good, Larson was good,Jackson was good,Goose was grat and people can enjoy it if they watch the movie with right expectations",1
1984,"The movie is crap, captain Marvel is just a very boring character becoz she is OP, marvel is done for if brie larson is taking the mantle",0
1985,Feminist **** Please stop making movies. You should be fired and be replaced,0
1986,Female main characters are always boring as hell. Wtf Disney what do u have with all the female sjw to come in great universere being main character. Let them side chicks.,0
1987,"0/10.Captain marvel was the worst marvel movie that I have ever seen, and I would even go so far as to say that it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. Absolutely everything about it is terrible. The vfx look like a camel did them blindfolded. The writing is about as lazy and unmotivated as a water balloon. The acting is comparable only to a wet towel. In both of my viewings of this film (if you can even call it that) I have never found a single justifiable component. The hulk is better. The incredible hulk is better. Spiderman far from home is better. The expired jar of peanut butter on my cupboard is better. There are far too many things that are horrendously nauseating to list here. If you watch this everything else that happens in your life will seem amazing compared to to this.",0
1988,"I'm giving this a one b/c of the visual effects. But, overall this is the worst MCU movie ever made. The most boring, who gives a s**t backstory of Captain Marvel. I honestly don't think Brie Larson was meant for this character at all. She was better in Endgame.",0
1989,"Why should most listen to the minorities? Don't you think that because of tolerance we started discrimination against Europeans? Is this today's reality? Another movie promoting feminism. It's nice to look at beautiful and sexy girls, and not at muscular women with a stone face.",0
1990,"In agreement with the majority of reviews, this film is simply awful. Brie Larson looks so incredibly bored playing Carol Danvers it's almost as if she was being forced to do so against her will. The feminist narrative was so heavy handed it felt like you were being smashed in the face with a sledgehammer. I spent the last 20 minutes looking at memes on my phone, as I'd completely lost interest.",0
1991,"Feminist trash, the cat is the only good part. They really are ruining comic book backstorys and character traits, in light of a new PC movement.",0
1992,Terrible film I thought Brie Larson acting was super stiff like a Terminator no emotion whatsoever avoid this terrible MCU film at all costs.,0
1993,"Marvel is normally good at special effects and they make sure you will notice, due to the amount of it they are packing in their movies, that isn't a problem though. Carol Danvers is casted well and the action is also pretty fun, but also seems a little bit too hectic sometimes. The plot twist isn't surprising at all and the flash backs are also more annoying than informative. I didn't like the humor in this movie at all. The nearly forced jokes made me laugh pretty rarely and also the emotional moment didn't quite always catch me as they should. But don't get me wrong Captain Marvel as a movie isn't a complete failure, but I know Marvel can do better.",0
1994,nick fury is ruined by a scene is this movie so dumb I feel as tho it could have only been a joke that just got too far.the mc in this movie is so mean and outright evil I thought of her as the villain please just don't waste your time.,0
1995,The worst movie of 2019! Why this film was supported by critics? Also Bri is bad actress.,0
1996,So i actually tried to watch this movie. I stopped with maybe 30 minutes left. I didnt like it. Their are so many bad things about this mivie. I would rather atand in line at a restaurant than watch this movie. The young Sam Jackson was bad,0

2002,"Só fez dinheiro por que surfou na onda dos vigadores, a atriz é tão expreciva como uma porta de Carvalho e chata pra caramba em entrevistas nota 1 pq tem o Samuel j tá no filme ele é nota 10",0
2003,"This movie gets all the points it has from Nick Fury and the Cat, which are a very funny combination. But their screen time is way to low and Brie Larson was just terrible, or the script is terrible or probably both - Captain Marvel doesn't look like a hero, she looks like someone who has something to prove for all the wrong reasons",0
2004,SJW soyboy libtard MAGA Brexit. If I made this film it would be the greatest. The best film ever. It'd be really good. I'd make Marvel great again. Mum! I'm nearly done owning these libs. I'll tidy my room later! This is why I hate women. How dare she feed me and pay my rent. I'm gonna be an incel.,1
2005,"In my opinion, this film is underrated. Sure it had problems, but it was still enjoyable. It had some nice comedy, the fight scenes were nice, but it definitely isn't as good as some other Marvel masterpieces. 7/10",1
