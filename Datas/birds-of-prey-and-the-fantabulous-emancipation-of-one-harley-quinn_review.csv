2,"The film is an absolute sacrilege. Every DC Comics character that appears in this film is treated like a stupid character. Black mask is ridiculous, Huntress is a 1-dimensional character, Montoya has no carisma...The script structure doesn’t makes sense, it throws away the rhythm of the film. The photography isn’t bad, but it isn’t good neither. The visual effects are maybe the best thing of the film. And the post-credit scene is absolutely a terrible mistake. I don’t want films like this in the DCEU. For me, this isn’t canon.",0
3,"Я понимаю что феминизм, я не ожидал логики, хрен с ней с идеей которую несет в себе фильм. Но блин на дворе 2020, как можно Настолько крупной студии обложаться с постановкой драк и спецэффектами? Юрий Бойко и Великий Джеки рыдают кровавыми слезами...",0
4,"I have no problem with different interpretations of Harley Quinn, and this one wasn't too bad aside from her needing more unnecessary violent crazy behavior baked in, but the entire rest of the cast had no reason to be in the film. If she needed help she should have gone to Ivy and that would have felt much more appropriate and focused to the film. The entire film felt choppy, the action scenes were frankly embarrassing, no character development aside from Harley (which still could have used some work), the plot was men are bad but I love men but they're the worst idk. This was an embarrassing experience and Harley deserved so so SO much more for her first leading performance film. I can only hope the sequel has NO Birds of Prey in it and the story revolves more around Harley discovering this yet to be villainized Ivy who's just coming to terms with her powers and they team up to get revenge on Ivy's enemies who turned her into Poison Ivy. I think most people would've enjoyed that story more than this one. Two girls taking revenge on the people who created them? Never mind I'm talking crazy, look at RT, people wanted THIS MOVIE!",0
5,"No story , no fun, characters you don't care for...  ridiculous. And I thought Suicide Squad was awful.. This sets a new standard. DC, stop trying.",0
6,"Character development, character development, character development. Take note, all lady writers/directors: interesting characters are necessary to engage an audience. Quirky for the sake of quirky is boring. Ask Jared Leto. I guess movie producers won't learn until there is literally a 10 year drought of interesting female characters.",0
7,"There are so many dropped plot lines that I'm positive this movie was re-shot and rewritten at least a half dozen times, and it shows.Poor Ewan McGregor deserved better than this after being the only decent actor in the prequels.",0
8,A rush movie without any type of storyline and God knows where they are heading with DCEU and it's characters..It's only Harley and Harley who has never been in BOP in comics...Mis usage of characters and movie..Just make a decision where do you wanna go with your movies..First you're making dark movies which were awesome and have direction and storyline now nothing.. save your money for Nolan's and other great movie..,0
9,"A superhero movie where not even a single character resembles the comic book equivalent, filmed with all the craftmanship of a $500 budget Youtube video. Miserable dreck, avoid.",0
10,"This movie was awful - walked out. Luckily I snuck in to see it (theater was almost empty) so I didn't put money towards this abomination.  Terrible ""team"" and a total departure from the H.Q. character. There is clear review manipulation going on as only a brainlet could enjoy this.",0
11,Another Hollywood flop more worried about pushing an agenda then putting out a good movie.,0
12,"It should've been 55/100, but due to current scores of this **** it's 0. This movie is a complete nonsense, cheap girl play, already classic impossible baby-fighting, retarded plot, lack of creativity and annoying, completely flat and almost boring Harley. I'm ok with the girl movies, but it feels like the plot subdues girls to play cheap and idiotic, don't know what the hell is going on in the US, but here in Ukraine it tastes like cheap dirt.",0
13,"The worst movie ever. The film has an awkward performance, a crude story. But action is worth seeing.",0
15,"I went with friends, hoping we could at least laugh at how horrible this movie is going to be... We couldn’t, it was just so sad and pathetic. At least Cats made us laugh.Woke level: Extremely cringey.",0
16,Just another bad movie filled with woke garbage. These woke writers need to leave Hollywood..,0
17,Garbage movie.  People giving this movie a 10/10 must be paid off.  Funny how the reviews below me have the name “Jerz” as their username & all 3 gave it a 10. Hmmm... Use your money to watch 1917 or Parasite instead.,0
18,I **** hate Suicide squad but i thing it’s better ate one point than birds of prey sorry DC fan boys that’s what it is the movie is so bad,0
19,This is no movie. This is a MISANDRIC depiction of females hatred towards all men. Whoever made the flick must see the court and go to jail!,0
20,"filme bem fraco, roteiro ruim circular e previsível, atuações BEM fracas cenas de ação muito forçadas, vi muito de esquadrão suicida nesse filme, fora a lacração feministas que não chega a irritar como em capitã marvel, o filme diverte mas nem tanto, depois de receber um Coringa, assistir harleyqueem e suas amigas foi brochante de mais",0
21,SJW feministic Man hating propaganda.  Toxic and boring movie I hope people won't spend money on this awful flick,0
22,Poorly handled movie on one of my favorite super teams from DC Comics & it really disappointed me. I was expecting an amazing movie due to Rotten Tomatoes but I was just slapped in the face for expecting something with substance. By the very same brand that has a badass movie like Wonder Woman. I don’t have words for the regret I have for spending money on this movie. If this was a straight to DVD or an exclusive movie on DCU. I would probably be more satisfied than wasting  over 100 minutes on a glorified Ghostbusters 2016 & Oceans 8. This is bordering Suicide Squad level of disappointment. I’m more interested in A Quest for Peace than I am this movie.oglorified Ghostbusters(2016) Al,0
23,"bad white man ... ready, group of women without any power or talent and without logic defeat hyper muscular ... ready, all men are stupid or bad .... ready, attractive girl to whom they hide its beauty so as not to ""sexualize it"" ... ready, ugly women occupying iconic characters and of great beauty changing their race to look good ... ready, LGBTI representation in a character that is not ... ready. How do you say it's not woke",0
24,Wow this movie is so bad woke movie never want to see it again classic sjw and feminists move please do yourself a favor and pass on this trash,0
25,Thank you so much for all the female empowerment thats all we want to be fed with.,0
26,"everything is awful:- pacing: painful. slow as a snail going over charcoal embers- characters: awful. no one is WOKE. there are mentions like ""ow white rich people is evil lets steal from them"" but thats the top WOKE the movie reaches.- music: if you enjoy free youtube music, then you will love this cause is the most generic music any hollywood movie ever had.- harley quinn emancipation: she ""kills"" the joker, then everyone on gotham wants to crucifice her, just cause? she makes a deal to survive. goes from villain to opotunistic moron, then villain and so on untill the ending.- rest of the cast: just names. NO character is truthful to their DC comics origins. its like if i take a random person from the street, i told her ""you are huntress. you are a martial arts expert and you are a badass, here are your lines GO"" and i put to film THE VERY FIRST shot (no time to have several takes)- the fight choreography... its easy to think you are watching a kick boxing session cause MOST of the hits the actress trows to the stuntman's lands in mid air. kudos to the stuntman's that play the part of passing away from a kick two feet's away. bonus: more than one ""henchmen"" is given a tiny bit kick to the shin's, and they do a full flip on the air before landing (purposely) on their behind's. apparently someone turn off the gravity for those scenes and turn on ""matrixing"" that a single push of a feet finger over your feet makes you spin on the air like a cirque du soleil stuntman. AND THEY EVEN DO CLOSE UPS OF THE GUYS probably to cover the god awful choreography...if you wanna spend your bucks, on a movie that is not intentionally or un-intentionally funny, be my guest. you are better trowing the bills to the fire than watching this garbage mess.",0
27,"“Birds of Prey” es una película que entretiene, pero no funciona mas de ahí.  Se desaprovecha casi todos los aspectos técnicos y actorales, solo dejando espacio a Margot Robbie con su Harley Quinn y Ewan McGregor con su Black Mask.  Lo demás es insulso.www.critican.do",0
28,"Another case of woke trash, combined with bad character portrayal, acting, and direction. Dont waste your money.",0
29,Really the worst movie I have seen in years. Cats was better even. Don't waste your time.,0
30,"What a terrible tool of feminist propaganda. The 'critics' double standards about this ultra violent woman participating in atrocious crimes is unbelievable. The plot sucks, the character development is terrible, the direction is atrocious, the only positives I would say it Margo and some of the side cast. Overall it's terrible. Avoid",0
31,"This film is extremely fun, actioned packed, and hilarious. Think kill bill or John wick meets Deadpool. The story is told from Harley Quinn’s perspective so it’s a crazy story. The action is unique and it’s got some pretty violent scenes. Huntress is hilarious and Black Canary is the breakout. Can’t wait to see more of this crew!",1
32,The worst movie I've seen in the cinema so far. I almost fall asleep in the cinema. Don't see it or buy it on Blu-ray.,0
34,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just terrible really. I like Harley Quinn as a character, I like Margot Robbie and I like DC. This movie made me hate all 3 of them. I can't express just how bad this movie was.  Hollywood have lost the plot putting out garbage like this and expecting people to like it.  What the hell is wrong with them?",0
36,"Basically this is a movie were the characters go from place to place without a motivation, because the plot is a pathetic excuse to push an agenda (not that weird these days). Of course every man is super evil and of course every woman is perfect, no flaws, a perfect mary sue that doesn't need nothing and nobody. None of the main characters faces any challenge or any type of struggle whatsoever, no character growth or interesting plot line, the movie is just brainless and stagnant. The fight scenes are incredibly pathetic, some of the worst I've ever seen. I would give it a 3/10 because it's a bad movie, but because of the feminist agenda and because of the fact that they BUTCHERED the original characters and the universe from which they came from, this ""movie"" deserves a 1/10 I'd rather watch ""the last jedi"" rather than watch this movie again",0
38,"So bad I couldn’t get to the end. And it was the main character, or perhaps the way she was portrayed, that made it so terrible. The nasally twang to her voice, her dumbness, her look. I know I’m not the target audience and it was probably a foregone conclusion that I wouldn’t like it all that much, but for a film to be so awful it’s unwatchable, that’s quite rare.I think it was the point where Harley had drunk herself into a stupor, and was therefore at the mercy of the creep in the alleyway, that I realised I’d had enough. That and Ewen McGregor (was he just slumming it for the pay cheque?).Maybe the end was spectacular and if I’d held on the movie would have redeemed itself. But I just couldn’t bear it. As it was, it took watching it (via iTunes) in three separate chunks to get to roundabout the halfway point.If you thought Suicide Squad couldn’t get any worse, you were wrong.",0
39,"It's sad to see how they butchered a lot of these well known characters, they are nothing like how they are written in the comics. The changes to them are bewilderingly stupid at times and the writer seems to know barely anything about them, showing little to no respect for the foundations of these characters laid out in the comic books. Perhaps she was drunk at 1am writing it and briefly read some summaries on the wiki and said ""I totally got this"", then proceeded to spew whatever she could onto the page before passing out blackout drunk. Just a guess.",0
40,"Uff what a waste of time. There is nothing remarkable about the movie, nor is it funny, to be honest I'm not sure who is the target for this mess",0
41,Loved The Joker. Really enjoyed it. Was so hyped when I saw this. I couldn't make it passed 40 minutes. This movie is trash. Everything about it is garbage.,0
42,What a mess... A mix of pointless violence and a childish script. They managed to ruin the only interesting character in Suicide Squad.,0
43,"A cheap and clumsy parody of Deadpool with Elements of Jack SparrowAbsolutely all all male characters are just bastards and stupid idiots maniacsAll the stuntmen kindly wait and fly away from all the blows doing somersaultsWhy are there 3 women there besides Quinn ?Why is a COLORED woman DIRECTOR who made only 1 unknown film given such a project and such money ?And Yes of course, this is written by a sexist not ready for such films",0
44,"a misandry moviei am so disappointed If you enjoy a man-hating, femsplaining, dumpster fires then this movie is for you! it is clearly a mysandry movie where every men are evil bastard or betrayer or in best situation finish being a pet hyena which I'm pretty sure is a male.",0
45,zero efforts to design gotham city for the film. they just took new york and everything and everyone looks so ordinary.,0
47,"Oh yay a bunch of f**king hate for this film. I liked it, especially Robbie's performance",1
50,"I can’t understand, how this bad film review . It’s so awful, when political propaganda exits in films",0
53,One of the worst movie ever. Just like Suicide Squad.It is better to watch the brick wall but not watch these shameless movies.,0
54,Worst movie I’ve seen by far. Almost fell asleep and I forced myself to finish watching it. My wife  missed the last half because she did fall asleep. I’m so glad I didn’t see it at the theater.,0
55,"First, as a Chinese, I felt offended when I heard character speaking Chinese in this stupid movie.Secondly this is probably the first movie that made me physically sick. OK I know feminism is the best money vacuum now. But this is the direcotor's understandig of feminism? Being independent because I got dumped??? What the **** is wrong with you dear director? And for IDK reason this is a super hero movie that directed by ""first asian female director"", but it dosen't mean its great. Its horrible, I want to spoon my ****ing eyeballs out then step on them. It causes me both mentally and physical pain. PLZ dont waste your time watching this. You can watch sun goes up and down for a day from horizon to horizon will be a better way to kill time. At least after doing this, you will appreciate life more. And I also dont recommend this as a date night movie, cause after watching this I am 100% positive you will have either a huge fight or a semi. This director twisted feminism, independence to vacuum money for its own benefit. I hope this director never got hired again to film anything anymore. And I also beg everyone to destroy all physical copies of this movie. If COVID-19 wiped out humanity, at least we can do something for the next generation from being metally and physically damaged by this movie.",0
56,"Harley Quinn reduce to a childs story, very pathetic and lack of action, its fightings scenes so boring that i prefer to see a walrus sleep than look at Margot Robbie face",0
57,"Me fuí sin esperanza para ir a verla y verdaderamente tenía razón... que hueso de película, no hay algo que conecte, no hay historia y no tiene buen rítmo. La pelúcula no se trata de aves de presa sino de Harley Q. Una película totalmente feminísta y no habria el xq fuese así. No pierdan su dinero. El villano... el villano? que triste lo que han hecho, punto malo para WB.",0
58,"The movie was unforgettable, thought it would get better it just got stale. The script is terrible, every aspect of the movie failed to deliver. If it was not for Margot Robbie doing a good job playing Harley Quinn. I would of walked out of the theater. Don't believe the hype skip this one!Summary: Birds of prey is average at best!",0
59,"Last year, while promoting his film “The Irishman,” Martin Scorsese compared comic book movies to theme parks, saying, “It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”  Clearly, Scorsese had just left an advance screening of “Birds of Prey.”The director and screenwriter will remain nameless, in the hope that they can put this unfortunate effort behind them and go on to use their obvious skills to make a film that’s interesting and important at some point in the future.  “Birds of Prey” is simply a bad idea poorly executed.  For some reason, the creative team has confused chaos with character development.  And they seem to believe that, by embracing anarchy, they are relieved of any obligation to develop a coherent story.  It doesn’t work for the Safdie Brothers (that’s right, “Uncut Gems”) and it sure doesn’t work here. Filling any film with manic activity eventually gets tiresome when it’s all just totally random.In case you care, Harley (Margot Robbie) gets into conflict with supervillain Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), who tends to cut the faces off people who annoy him.  In order to get back into Roman’s good graces, since she no longer has the protection of Joker, she must find and deliver to Roman a gigantic diamond. Blah, blah, blah.The actors here really aren’t to blame.  Robbie (so deserving of Oscar consideration for “I, Tonya” and this year’s “Bombshell”) has committed fully to the irrational exuberance of her character.  Regrettably, she was apparently contractually committed to doing incessant voiceovers in an accent that made me yearn to stab my eardrums with sharp pencils.  Her accent, and the content she is required to deliver, make the voiceovers in “Deadpool” seem Shakespearean.  In “Deadpool,” there’s at least an amusing tone of self-deprecation.  But then, self-deprecation and irony require self-awareness and this film has none.Given the similar source material, it’s not surprising that “Birds of Prey” trades in the same nihilism as this year’s “Joker.”  But unlike “Joker,” this film offers no broader social commentary, no larger point.One strong element of the film is its approach to the violence that appears on the screen in nearly non-stop fashion.  Using a series of continuous, slow-motion long shots, the creative team has given the violence an almost balletic appearance (in the Hong Kong style of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”).The most unpardonable aspect of this film is its apparent belief that if it says “girl power” often enough or even hints at “female empowerment,” all sins will be forgiven.  This is a film written, directed and starring women.  But that doesn’t make it creative, interesting or worthwhile.  In fact, at key points, the women demonstrate some startlingly male traits – self-absorption, an enthusiasm for irrational violence and, worst, a capacity to perceive other women as friends only when it’s convenient.  All of this leaves any gender themes perched atop a very rickety thematic structure that threatens to topple under its own weight at any minute.",0
60,"This film is bland and forgetable to say the least. All of the characters have little connect to their comicbook counter parts. Black Canary was betrayed as a character and Huntress could have been cut and nothing would have changed. Zasz wasn't himself in the least, Blackmask was discount Joker. The score was annoying to say the least and the visuals were vomit inducing. Editing was always a tad off and the story was a cluster of a mess. Listening to HQ's voice for nearly 2 hours was painful to say the least. Comedy was hit or miss and the action was pretty engaging for the most part, except for the ending. Every man in this film was a jerk, a simp, or a coward and color me not impressed because of that. Not worth the ten dollar ticket, I'm going to watch Wonder Woman again.",0
61,"The Movie isn't great. I really does push on the brand of Harley Queen to Much. They had a sort of good thing going with suicide squad but this just pushes the limits to far. It's great that we have more women as strong protagonists, but it just could have been done a lot better. If we look at movies and TV-shows with great female protagonists like Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) in Hidden Figures, Ciri (Freya Allan) in The Witcher or Hermione Granger (Emma watson) in Harry Potter they really played their roles well and they don't just push it for recognition or awards; but i seems like they played their roles not expecting awards or applause; it just seems more natural. I can not say the same about this movie though, it really has become the standard Hollywood sellout; ""They've got a got gig out and just sell out for max profit.Unless you really need to watch it; please stay away.",0
62,"This film breaks my heart as a DC comic book fan of the original and iconic Birds of Prey by Chuck Dixon. This is far removed far removed from the classic version that never should've been used in the first place. The characters, Huntress, Canary and most infuriating Cassandra Cain were do not resemble their comic book counterparts both in appearance and in character. The idea of this film being called birds of prey without even Barbara Gordon(Oracle) is a crime. They should've just called this film Harley Quinn or the Gotham City Sirens (with Poison Ivy) becasue 90 percent of the film wasn't about the team.All aside, the casting is decent(Margot Robbie can do no wrong as Harley Quinn), the usage of colour The use of colourswere great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences hat mostly make no sense.However this film fails on lack of characterization, decent story, generic to boring and laughable villain(played greatly by Ewan Mcgregor),heesy acting from most of the cast, the apparent sexisim tone in this film and lack of motivation for the characters except fight the patriarchy. This was a laughable film that tries too hard to be like Deadpool. DC should start reading comics from the golden age and take notes before lazily take titles of beloved franchises and make unnecessary changes from the classic comics.All aside, the casting is decent(Margot Robbie can do no wrong as Harley Quinn), and some fun action scenes that mostly make no sense.However this film fails on lack of characterization, decent story, generic to boring and laughable villain(played by Obi Wan) and lack of motivation for the characters except fight the patriarchy.

65,"This movie was a waste of money. Giving away my hard earned money to this ""film"" will haunt me till my dying days. Everything in this movie feels so forced. Pure cringe.",0
66,"I like most of the recent DC films that have come out in the last few year, so my opinion might be the odd opinion. One film I didn't like though was Suicide Squad and this film hits a lot of the same notes that failed that film. I am a Margot Robbie fan, and she is amazing as always in Birds of prey, just everything else felt off, the world they have built here feels uninteresting and the styles and costumes are just NOT appealing to me. I Really didn't like the clothes Harley was wearing, I don't think she should have do the whole sexy psycho thing, but at least a little femme fatale would be good. In this film she is dressed like a 5 year old or a cat lady or something. Part of Harley charm has always been the fact she is drop dead gorgeous and insanely intelligent. But at the same time she is straight up dangerous and even though every man wants her , most a to scared to even try. In Birds of Prey she doesn't come across as attractive at all, she is actually sort of gross ,they have leaned into the ""Mental Patient"" look way to much.",0
67,"Listen, as a constant movie goer who enjoys to see movies from DC and Marvel, I am consistently underwhelmed by how poor DC movies have been ever since Nolan stopped with Batman. Here with Birds of Prey I find myself asking myself similar questions: What is the uniqueness to the plot? Why does Quinn seem pointless as a character? Why choose this cast? Overall, there is countless questions that comes about from this movie.Overall, this movie isn't much better than Suicide Squad (which may have been the worst movie I've ever seen). The acting was absolutely atrocious, with Margot Robbie essentially saving the day with her role of Harley Quinn. Although it still seemed forced and dragged, it felt like Robbie was trying to carry the entire movie on her shoulders, which unfortunately could not happen. The screenplay was pointless, I am still questioning why someone would actually write something up like this and actually say it was good. It is baffling. The aggressive, relentless, and tiresome force to shove women's equal rights down people's throats was nauseating as well. I am all for women's rights and the injustices that women fight for on a consistent basis, but this was poorly articulated in the film. The portrayal of certain characters pains me to see because some of them have great stories behind them.Unfortunately, I find myself seeing this movie as a wanna be Deadpool movie for DC (except Deadpool is actually good). I could say a lot more, but it seems pointless to write something on this movie anyways. This movie is just bad, I do not understand why DC can't make good movies.",0

77,The problem with this movie is that it's a Margot Robbie vanity project with no understanding of these comic book characters and their leagcy. This movie reinforces the idea that the focus for Margot was only on herself and her character while dissing comic book fans. She also made the assumption that female comic fans like myself only like Harley Quinn which is another insult  because she didn't think we would notice the assassination of these characters. The film is mediocre at best like last comic book films such as Elekta or Green Lantern but it looks childish and sloppy next to a film like Joker.,0

83,"As someone who bleeds DC this was hard to watch. It does have a lot of good points about it. Action scenes are well done, The sound is great. Overall the performances are mostly solid.There are two massive, inescapable elephants in the room though. A clear misandrist platform and like Wonder Woman and Aquaman (the two worst DC movies in recent memory) its trying WAY too hard to model these films after Disney.  I am not going to go into the sexism rampant in the film because too many other reviewers will. However the Disney tropes are every bit as rampant from start to finish and ultimately what it causes is the film to be BORING. Each scene trying too hard to outdo the last scene till it just becomes a boring slog that will lull you to sleep with how ""awesome"" it thinks it is.I REALLY wanted to like this. Despite being REALLY sexist given the setting of a BoP film I only deducted two points for that. What gutted the film 5 points is yet again this is another example of DC trying to hard to be like Disney and when you have DC degrading itself to be like the #EvilestCorporationOnEarth what is the point of watching what is like 70% the same you would get from the plague rat?Warner Brothers is going to have to do something to right this ship and unfortunately, Robert Pattinson is NOT going to be the salvation either.",0

Of the 1000 or so movies I’ve seen in 50-55 years, I have only walked out maybe twice. So I stayed and just got more disappointed. The Woke feminist messages, (idiot, weak police, creepy guys, thugs, all men are evil!)  the non-sexy Harley costumes, the nearly nonexistent storyline. The breakfast sandwich? The Black Mask rarely wearing the mask, (and face, it he was not that interesting) the young pick-pocket girl that could not act. Help! Let me out of this lame, bright, crazy world!

Oh wait, when was Heath Ledger's Joker? If that was within the last ten years, then I saw that one too) I can safely say that my female friend would have to drag me out and pay me to see it.

Let's take a whimsical character originally created for a children's cartoon and put her in a hyper violent, gory R-rated film with lots of F-bombs, a paint by numbers plot and a confused feminist message [apparently empowerment is the same as being violent]. Also, we'll take one of the most beautiful actresses on the planet, make her look completely unappealing. What could go wrong? Well, everything. Everything went wrong.",0
123,"To most people contemplating Watching Birds of Prey they wish to know whether or not this film is better than Suicide Squad. To that I answer which is better a heart attack or a stroke? The truth of the matter is, this movie is bad, really bad. I could go on how this is a massive missed opportunity for a Harley Quinn/Posion Ivy film or female lead superhero film but for this review I won't. Often with movies like this it's hard to begin to note the serious underlying issues within a film but in this case it's quite easy and that is the films screenplay.This films screenplay has to be one of the worst scripts ever written for a movie. I honestly think that if you made a film about how this screenplay managed to get green-lit and filmed it using a potato you would instantly have an infinitely better film. The number of plot jumps, tonal shifts, lack of regard for continuity, awful dialogue, overuse of tropes and forgettable characters should be reason enough to burn the script and blacklist the writer (Who was also responsible for 2017's Unforgettable). What you ultimately have in this film is an inferior gender swapped DC version of Deadpool 2 mixed with elements of Suicide Squad. Anti-hero protagonist takes on juvenile criminal orphaned ward. Said ward is wanted by the films villain, anti-hero realizes they care for the kid, anti-hero assembles a team of unsung heroes to save kid, etc. Its borderline insulting to audience.Next up we have characters. Each character in this film is presented with some form of backstory Huntress, an orphaned assassins who hunts down the men who killed her family; Montoya a middle aged detective overlooked by her male counterparts; Black Canary, a nightclub singer bound in service to Black Mask; Cassandra Cain, a criminal foster child with slight of hand; and Harley Quinn the ex paramour of the Joker. They are rivaled by C tier Batman villain's Black Mask, a woman hating mob boss; and Zsasz, a psychopathic killer who marks his kills on his body. All of these however are very valid backstories supported by decade long comic runs, however every single one of these characters have no ark at all and are completely one dimension and insulting to their source material such as Montoya and whatever constitutes as Victor Zsasz in this film. I had no enjoyment watching any of them and for as good as Margot Robbie is as Harley Quinn there is just too damn much Harley and it gets exhausting. Ewan McGregor who has really shined recently is just sad to watch as Black Mask, and I also feel for Mary Elizabeth Winstead who was just wasted.The films direction is also questionable if you loved the tacky and hideous set and costume design of Suicide Squad you'll probably be okay with Birds of Prey. Once again the cast look like homeless people and the sets pumped with more than enough neon and dark colors. Fight sequences offer little that is new and feel crammed into the movie to wake up the audience. The stakes in this movie are low and I found I really didn't care about the plight of the heroes.I definitely recommend not watching this movie. If you're after spectacular screenplay watch Parasite or Marriage Story or if you wish to see a great movie co-written by a woman watch 1917. But this is a definite missed opportunity.",0
125,"Awful graphics, awful controls, awful camera and bad theme. This is a pretty mediocre release in every way. Graphics are like welcome to five years ago. Were they blindfolded when making the camera? Main character is boring. Hopefully this is the last movie in the series",0
126,"I found this movie to be a bit boring actually. The supporting characters were dry and unlikable. The other birds of prey (what little you see of them) are a bit dull. If you have nothing better to see then go ahead, but don't pay for it. It's a filler-movie if you are trapped in a snowstorm and there's nothing else on. Pass.",0

132,"Birds of prey was incredible. The movie had amazing writing, the best jokes in a dc movie so far, the most incredible fight choreography I've seen second to only that of John Wick. The movie's performances were amazing. It's a shame that the movie was marketed so badly and it's bombing at the box office because of it. It was marketed as a film that men should see so they can learn that women don't need them and they're toxic. But the film itself isn't that woke and the messages it pushes about how women don't need men are very suttle and way less annoying than I anticipated.",1

137,"Robbie shined, McGregor was an excellent villain. Everything else about this movie felt forced and forgettable. It is by far the worst written film of the DCEU, Yes even above Suicide Squad. Nearly every new character introduced did not need to be in this film, They tried to introduced too much and for no good reason.The Huntress had absolutely no relevance to the plot. Montoya is just a generic cop character that was totally unnecessary. Zsasz was totally miscast and was by far the worst character in the movie. Black Canary had potential but was poorly utilized.Birds of Prey is a perfect example of not just a terribly written movie but an example of a production that clearly had no idea wtf it was doing.",0

140,"In 2016 DC tried to get their own Guardians of the Galaxy, but with bad guys (since they never stopped stressing it) And that idea didn't work for them.Shortly after they released an extra cut of that same film giving more scenes to the character who stole the attention of the audiences: Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn.I assume that at some point some executive at Warner said: ''We should get her a film for herself and as a bonus we get our own Deadpool''.I really think that's how they started this disaster.For me Birds of Prey is the worst DC film so far, not only for how cheap it looks but for the simplicity of its execution and its devastating lack of imagination.The interactions are laughable, there's no chemistry between the girls and the cherry on the top of this disaster cake is how they manage to waste one of Batman's best villains.Let me make this clear and the title change in the US proves it: This is Margot Robbie's film and just her. She has really adopted the character and is the only real reason to see this film, but Robbie also makes clear that she needs better screenwriters and better directors to shine. We'll see if James Gunn manages to do her justice.And just to put it out there I must comment this film demonstrates again the lack of a plan behind this shared universe because unless their plan is to go down this way, at the end of it all, Birds of Prey brings absolutely nothing for the future of this franchise.Especially considering that what's behind it are Aquaman and Shazam and what comes next is Wonder Woman 1984 and just right after that one; The Batman, which is supposed to be an epic film for DC and Warner, so you kinda wonder what the hell they were doing here.",0

145,"Welcome back to Stream to Big Screen! Now, it’s time for the DC Universe to expand on the big screen. Meet the Birds of Prey as introduced by the fantabulous Harley Quinn. Yes, that irrepressible, wild card and former paramour of the Joker is emancipated from the Suicide Squad and shepherding us through the origin story of that lady gang, featuring Renee Montoya, Black Canary and The Huntress. Margot Robbie reprises effervescent and sly portrayal of Harley. Here, she dominates. I don’t know what Birds of Prey would be without her.Like most origin stories, Birds of Prey starts each character off in their own contained silo until they all come together in order to service the plot. As comic book movies go, this plot is not important. A bad guy wants a thing that will give him money to dominate the city. The “good” guys, or in this case the better girls, want to stop him because he’s a jerk trying to harm an innocent kid. Yada yada yada! Crash, bang, boom! The movie ends. Let’s be honest, you’re not going to see this movie because you want to be surprised by what happens.Cathy Yan’s direction of the film can barely contain all of the energy Robbie brings to Harley Quinn, which makes the titular, Birds of Prey, take a bit of a backseat, and the screenplay by Christina Hodson is a little all over the place. I actually wish it had been funnier. There are funny quips here and there, but overall I wasn’t LOLing as much as I had hoped. There’s so much going on throughout the film. There are cartoon vignettes, explosions, and a lot of kicking butt. Also, Ewan McGregor, playing Roman Sionis, this movie’s mustache-twisting villain, and Chris Messina, the sinister henchman, are so outsized in their performances that they make more of an impact that the Birds of Prey as well – although McGregor, in particular, should have been reined in a bit. In fact, I wish there had been more to The Huntress. She just recedes in the background while both Renee Montoya, played by Rosie Perez, and Black Canary, played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell, get good moments and hold their own against the otherwise dominating Harley Quinn.Nevertheless, there is a lot to like aside from just Margot Robbie. The film’s runtime is manageable and not bloated like some other comic book movies – I’m looking at you, Marvel Universe. In general, the movie moves at a good clip, not really wasting time. The fight scenes have a lot of pizzazz to them, which is interesting considering how dark films set in Gotham can be. Also, there are some really good and interesting music choices sprinkled throughout.Birds of Prey is worth the price of a ticket in the theater. It was a fun night at the cinema. Sure, the plot isn’t important but you’re really just there to see Harley Quinn wreak havoc. And, havoc she wreaks!I think we completely agree on this one. DC Comics has provided one of their more entertaining films with Birds of Prey. When the dust clears, DC has provided the theaters their female Deadpool-like protagonist. I do wish the movie were a bit funnier and the villain a bit more essential to the story but I’ll suffice with great fight scenes instead. This movie definitely is a good watch on the big screen but save yourself a few bucks with a matinee showing.",1
146,"funny, action packed with a fabulous performance by Margot Robbie as the star herself Harley Quinn",1
147,I honestly do not see much of what people could find wrong with this film. I expected a thing worse than suicide squad and was pleasantly surprised. I mean how can people honestly rate this film without seeing it. I do feel like it’s possibly marketed incorrectly and the wrong demo ends up seeing it and gets repulsed. I genuinely liked it.,1
148,I loved this movie! Margot Robbie does an amazing job! I had such a great time watching this movie.,1
149,"I really have no idea where the bad reviews are coming from. This movie was 109 minutes full of just stupid fun. No, this is not a serious movie. And no, it also is not a super hero movie. But if you are looking for a good action movie, Birds of Prey might be your thing. It doesn't take itself serious at all and it doesn't try too hard like you would expect from a DC movie. If you wanna turn off your head for one and a half hours and just want to have a good time then I recommend this movie.",1
150,La peor película del universo de DC.  sin identidad ni rumbo. incluso esta desconectada de Escuadrón suicida . no se explica donde esta el resto del mundo mientras se dan estos acontecimientos.,0
151,"Deadpool meets Scott Pilgrim in the most glorious way.One thing you can guarantee about superhero movies is that they often convey in their style, the tone of their main characters. And in this case that's a whole lot!Firstly the entire film hinges on Margot Robbie and there are moments in this film where I am suddenly reminded: Oh yeah, this is the actress that played Tonya Harding in I, Tonya! I forget how incredible she is until Harley is suddenly draped in humanity and Robbie activates her acting glands. In this film you can see her pain and her humanity and her strife and I was truthfully moved by that because it's made tangible and relatable inbetween all the funsies. But she's also so lively and likeable and she infuses Harley (appropriately) with the spirit of a live-action cartoon.Little stings of humanity reinforce Harley as a lived-on character; too often we see comic characters as untouchable, unknowable statues, they seldom pick up groceries, or live in dumps, or get smashed and cause trouble because they're unhappy. The script normalises Harley in an interesting way.These props go to the script which manages to feel like a solid superhero movie and a sort of cop film while also linking all the characters together in a cat's cradle of interweaving. But the real star is Cathy Yan who is a really accomplished director here; the film is often beautiful and balanced between comic booky and grounded, but she just manages to capture these women so well, we look upon them with a kind of fresh look; they're powerful and sexy but not viewed through male gaze, they're fun and rich.And I was thinking during the (solidly satisfying action) that I've never seen such a creative use of roller skates in action before, and that stems mostly from male dominated action protagonists, and I was grateful for something so exciting and unique. The hair tie moment and many others were a simple breath of fresh air. I’m also sick of the macho samey nonsense in films and the sexism. Further to this I enjoyed the respect given to Harley Quinn's lore; Her Psychiatrist background is referenced plenty, but also her madness is explored by her talking to camera and also a voice-over that infers she’s talking to herself. Also, that comment about what crazy actually was, was a cute, grounding commentary and a get out of jail free card to the film approaching the idea of her craziness. Black Mask was terrible and nonsensical and not at all the imposing monster he was in the comics, however, Roman Sionis as a character was very compelling; a rich, entitled, greedy, spoilt Trump-figure who saw Gotham and its inhabitants as his toys; roaming around showing off his masks and patronising and mansplaining his way around his spoils. As a generic mob boss (and his unexplained penchant for removing faces) failed, where his moments of unmasked, unbridled showings of sexual power and dominance was breathtakingly disgusting and effective and I was glad (for some reason) that a woman wrote it and a woman directed it. Zasz was also a welcome surprise, a good actor, fuelling Sionis, and with a rich arc for a henchman. The sets were bad and some of the locations suffered from too much dark blue and atmospheric fog, and the actual Birds of Prey were scant together; relegated largely just to a third act fight.I'm sure this film will be rated less once the novelty of it wears of, but the experience I had was fantastic watching it. And hand on heart, I could definitely stand to see another one, one with the gang all together, and I didn't miss Batman or the Joker one bit.",1

Mary Elizabeth Winstead is hot.",1

171,"A thoroughly enjoyable, laugh-out-loud, off-color superhero offering that serves as a tremendous showcase for Margot Robbie and a superb supporting cast. The picture's inventive use of animation, its spot-on soundtrack and its knock-out production design all effectively enhance the picture's tongue-in-cheek storyline and combine to make for a fun time at the show. The narrative admittedly becomes a little needlessly complicated at times, but, that aside, this is a surprisingly strong release for this time of year. It would be a shame if it's forgotten for awards consideration come the end of 2020.",1
173,"One of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life, even Margot Robbie was awful trying to act like Deadpool which fell flat on her face.

And I can say the same about Sonic, both movies are greate. Lets be honest, this movie dont deserve 0/10, nothing close to it.  There is woman empowerment but so what?

183,"went into this with little to no expectation. I absolutely think this movie deserves to be highlighted the action and the comedy are great, I will agree and say that at times the movie does kind of seem like its to out there with the colors and things but if you went into expecting any different with Harley as a main character then I think you probably didn't know that much about the character. With that being said I pleasantly enjoyed the very subtle and understating feminist points I think if you want to make a female lead movie don't make a big deal about it just make a good movie and the positive response will follow.With that being said this movie proves that point actions speak louder than words. I think that the movie was very well paced and had very little to gripe about the couple of things I didn't care for was the big fight in the end was a little chaotic and left me wishing I could of seen more of it but i honestly think that has more to do wit the projectors at the movie theaters not really giving a great contrast with dark scenes. All that being said its absolutely worth a watch lots of fun and very little bad to say about it.",1

Se que la película no cumplió con lo estimado pero tambien tengamos en cuenta la situación mundial, sin duda es una película que recomiendo mucho",1
186,"Good movie, solid action with funny one liners catching the spirit of the comics.",1
187,"this is an amazing movie to look at the fighting scenes were amazing and the overall filming and effects were magnificent and I have got to say Margot Robby really outdid her self in this movie but the story wasn't that much I have watched this movie like two days ago and I can bearly remember what it was about and to be honest I am not disappointed because I came to this movie with low expectations storywise because of the whole team of women thingy I was afraid it was gonna focus on that and thank god it didn't because it would feel soo forced and it would make the whole movie awkward. in conclusion, if you like the character Harley Quinn or appreciate amazing fighting scenes/visual effects in movies I think you would love this movie as much as I did, but if you are looking for a good story this might not be the movie for you.",1
188,I'm surprised by how good this film is. This is the first DC movie I see in a while and I really enjoyed it. The humour and the visuals are the best on the movie.,1
189,I loved it! No stop action packed fun. I didn’t expect much but ended up loving it. Margo did a great job.,1
190,"Mediano. Roteiro preguiçoso e conveniente em boa parte do tempo, mas com uma direção competente e uma boa fotografia e trilha sonora.",1
191,"I came into the movie having low expectations. I didn't like Suicide Squad and I feel like most of the DCU movies are meh at best(w/ a couple exceptions) but I left the theater pleasantly surprised! I wouldn't say that this is the best DC movie I've seen but honestly, it was a lot of good fun. I found myself laughing at alot of the funny parts- a few jokes fell flat but most were good, the action had me at the edge of my seat or cringing. I'm not a fan of seeing bones break so that made me a little uncomfortable but honestly, it wasn't a bad thing. Pros- The story was just a fun rollercoaster ride with a good amount of action, good amount of laughs, a few heart felt moments, and Margo's Harley impression was really good. Like it made me think of the 90's Batman TAS Harley Quinn voice. it was a little off but I loved hearing her do it either way!There was alot of subtle nods to the comic books that I loved. Also I saw this with a friend that isn't a huge comic book fan but they totally got it. They never felt lost or felt like they had to ask me questions in order to be filled in on what's what or whose who. Alot of nerds will rage about this but ppl need to remember that this movie was made for the masses & the fact that the general audience can watch this w/o feeling lost is a GOOD THING.There were a couple issues that i had with the movie but honestly, they were minor. Character development felt a little short bc the cast was a decent size but it felt like by the end of the movie, I didn't know much about the background of a few of the main characters. I knew about their comic book counter parts and I know that the movie can't spent hours developing the characters but the underdevelopment made me care lil less about them? Killing off the bad guy- This is an issue that I have w/ every super hero movie (http://nrdy.co/marvel-dc-comics-villains/). They kill off the bad guys so there's no chance of them coming back unlike comic books where the fact that they keep coming back is what keeps the stories going. I didn't mind Zsasz dying b/c i kinda forget he's a thing at times but Black Mask seems like a bigger villain to just kill off.Over all I dont understand the hate boner ppl have for this movie. This is definitely a better movie than most of the DCU movies, it was fun, exciting, funny, and truly enjoyable. Is it the best DCU movie? Naw (WW has that tbh) but is it a good DCU movie? Yes! Would i recommend my friends to watch it? Yes",1

193,"The Movie ""Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)"" is an incredible and fun movie, witch was very superior to its successor ""suicide squad""",1
194,"Now, I haven’t done this since Batman v Superman, but I’ve been such a big fan of the recent DC movies that I actually went out of my way to see Birds of Prey in the first-run theatre, even though it’s a sequel to Suicide Squad, which I hated. How was it? It was good! However, I didn’t enjoy it as much as the other recent DC movies. It’s not as campy or creative as Aquaman, it’s not as funny or heartfelt as Shazam! and it’s not as mature or gritty as Joker. It has all of those elements, but I didn’t think they were as strong. I enjoyed it about as much as Wonder Woman. It’s quite good, but I think it could’ve been better. I wasn’t really into the story structure of the film. It was really weird, the first half of the movie or so is told in a nonlinear way with Harley Quinn narrating over everything. It jumped around a little too much for my liking. I also think the narration is overused, it got a little old after a while. There were also some weird editing choices, but it wasn’t NEARLY as bad as Suicide Squad! There were also too many characters, it’s both a Harley Quinn solo movie and a Birds of Prey origin story. I’m not really sure why they did that. Just Harley would’ve been enough to carry the film, the other characters weren’t as interesting and the movie kinda drags whenever it focuses on them. If it were up to me, I would’ve retooled the story a bit to include Catwoman and Poison Ivy instead of the Birds of Prey and make it a Gotham City Sirens movie. Though, again, the ensemble cast of the movie is handled way better than Suicide Squad. Finally, this movie did not need to be an R. There’s just some violence that could easily be toned down and some swearing that could easily be cut. It feels like a movie that would appeal most to teenagers, but (in the States at least) they can’t see it. It’s not like Joker, which really earned the R-rating with its subject matter. I don’t feel like Birds of Prey really did. This movie would reach a wider audience if it were rated PG-13. Also, I don’t like the title. It’s too long and doesn’t sound good or interesting to a casual audience member. However, with all that said, this movie is a lot of fun. It’s very colourful and good-looking and it takes place in a very cool version of Gotham City. You actually get to see people being nice to each other on a beautiful sunny day, as well as the darkness and violence that you would expect from a Batman movie. This movie has some laughs, is well-acted and the action is well-done. When the real story actually gets going, it’s engaging and entertaining. Harley Quinn is a great lead character and the movie has a good soundtrack. The villains are also very enjoyable! Oh yeah, and I LOVED the opening with the hand-drawn animation! Also, even though this is a sequel to Suicide Squad, it does stand on its own and no Jared Leto Joker is to be found! The Joker is in this movie, but they use the comic/animated series design. That was funny. I also think it’s funny to imagine this movie as a sequel to Joker. Just a fun thought experiment. Overall, I do think the movie is holding itself back. I was expecting something more along the lines of Scott Pilgrim or Baby Driver, something with really creative and over-the-top action with great characters and comedy. However, I can’t fault the movie for what it isn’t and, for what it is, this is a good movie. I recommend giving it a watch, especially if you’re a Harley Quinn fan.",1
195,"Birds of prey!, It's a few feminine feminine movie in all time, the feminine force that the movie presents is spectacular, he surely breaks standards and leaves us with a taste of ""I want more"".",1
196,"0/10 - horrible, disgusting, nasty. Uh, wait, 1/10 - Ewan McGregor deserved, he is awesome, as always.",0
197,"Solid 7. Much better than the same recycled garbage that Marvel pushes out. Not horrible like Suicide squad. Actually has a storyline, albeit a simple one. Not as dark as other DC movies, this one is more light hearted. Doesn’t push the whole “girl power” thing in your face. Soundtracks are bomb.",1
198,"Harley is the only good thing about this movie, and it’s so packed with other characters establishing the individual birds of prey that she isn’t the star she should be. Horrible plot, over-the-top woke feminist undertones, horrible antagonist, and absolutely no respect for its source characters. I’m a huge DC fan and was horribly disappointed",0
199,"I watched the movie on the second day playing on theater in Indonesia specially in Bali. The storytelling to the audiance is percfectly catch up. Margit Robbie as Harley Quinn who I never ever doubt . The Gang of Birds of prey was si amazing as women who struggle from thier **** damn life. This movie is absolutely fun, badass, killer, feminim,blast, and.... Survive!!!",1
200,This is an amazing movie..................................................... I just Love it,1
201,"O filme é divertido e alegre, uma ótima aposta para quem ama filme do gênero.",1
202,"Bordas of prey should have been call Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey, still a very good movie and fun to watch, nice action scenes, diverse cast with is the story of a girl just finding her way to be independent without being overly feminist women, perhaps two unnecessary scenes but that's it, Ewan McGregor is terrifying as vilain, ver",1
203,"Perhaps one of the best action packed female heroine fantasy films made to date! Incredible stunts, editing, filmography, fight scenes, acting & just super fun!!! Super talented female  director, writer & of course cast!!! Walked out smiling. For S.F critic, if the cast was all men, Mick (0 LaSalle) would have given it a 10.",1
204,"Amazing movie, amazing cast, amazing director. Everything about this movie is amazing",1
205,"God this feminine **** never leaves does it? I'm so tired of it and my god another failure rise up upon us again! I'm not gonna say anything, just I hope Hollyhood can stop all of this disgusting, stupid, and childish nonsense! I had low expectations for this movie and man did it deliver.",0
206,"Loved everything about it. Its very fun and entertaining from beginning to end, with plenty of easter eggs from DC. It also includes the brutality that Gotham deserves (hence the R rating). Great movie!",1
207,"Too bad :(  was an oportunity to have some really kick ass action movie but nooooope  . all we hear is ""yeaaa we r awesome "" but not substance at all.  Whats the point to to an R movie when its really so silly??   its in the same league and made for the exact reasons as with the female ghostbusters and ocean.",0
208,"O filme é muito bom, muito engraçado, porém com bastante violência, mas q isso n atrapalha para a nossa diversão. Possui boas cenas de luta sem serem enjoativas. Podem assistir!",1
209,"One of the best DC movies in forever! It's crazy, chaotic, violent and so much fun to watch! Never knew how much fun it would be to see someone do acrobatics while crushing someone's skull, I was laughing and cheering almost the whole movie. Couldn't do Harley Quinns character any better, and I'm surprised by how much I liked the other interpretations of the birds of prey. Definatly a must watch!",1
210,"Melhor filme que assisti em toda minha vida, em minha opinião, melhor que coringa.",1
211,This has got to be the best movie I’ve ever watched! Definitely a must see!,1
212,I have been impressed by how easy it is to predict what is coming. The script doesn’t have any good content and could be written by a 15 year old feminist girl,0
213,"it was a great, funny movie. I loved Harley Quinn’s character which makes sense because she was the only one who made suicide squad tolerable",1
214,how come people are not enjoying this. literally one of the best HQ films ever made. billion times better than joker. margot served perfect acting as always. and if you don’t like it you’re just too dumb or too sexist to see (probably both).,1
215,It’s good. I recommend it. Great fight scene at the end and Harley Quinn/Huntress/Black canary are brilliant.,1
216,"I freaking loved this movie! Margret Robbie nailed the role as Harley Quinn!! She is such an amazing actress! The fight scenes were absolutely phenomenal, and it was very entertaining to get a story from her perspective. I mean, I love Mr J... but we finally get a peak into Harley's crazy mind. The editing, pacing of the movie, and narration only added to this. The animated intro was also great. People really need to give this movie a chance. Yeah a bunch of men die, but come on... it's a story about redemption and liberation from the mind of a psychotic woman with mad acrobatic skills... why wouldn't she narrate it this way? Also, I noticed the movie had a lot of inspiration from the Injustice games. I'm not sure if they used stunt doubles but it was top notch choreography. The rest of the cast was great as well! I'll be definitely watching this again!",1
217,"After the events of Suicide Squad, it is safe to say that Harley Quinn's break up with ""The Joker"" actually worked quite well in Birds of Prey. What turns out to be a surprise is the stunt choreography led by John Wick's Chad Stahelski and the colorful cinematography. And everything else except a cheap one-dimensional villain is just icing on the cake. DCEU finally has a good R-Rated film and it didn't disappoint. Is it bad and feminist as Captain Marvel? Nope, but it's certainly a bloody good time seeing these women kicking ass in this gritty Tarantino-like DC flick. At least I didn't drink bleach after seeing it.",1
218,"Robbie as Harley is hilarious... Lots of dope violent action and funny dialogue. DC continue its solid run of films (Aquaman, Shazam, Joker and now Birds of Prey)  Huntress and Black Canary are badass charcters that I hope we see more of in the future.",1
219,Well done DC movie. Better than CGI filled Captain Marvel & Black Panther. Ewan McGregor really steals the show.,1
220,"BIRDS OF PREY is a bright and insane world. While it took a bit for this viewer to appreciate the grandiose display of exaggerated violence intermixed with a bit of reality, it became harder and harder to resist as its less than two hour run time went on. Once you get used to the hyper stylized storytelling and direction, you'll find much to enjoy here.Robbie is a wonder as Harley Quinn, and she manages to bring a glorious sense of fun to her morally questionable and selfish anti-hero. While the violence doesn't necessarily seem like it deserves an R-rating , aside from a scene or two , the energy that Director: Cathy Yan creates manages to make this all work in the end. It's certainly not perfect, but with a ton of bright spots - including an ode to Marilyn Monroe.Self-aware, in your face and refusing to apologise for it, D.C., and Harley herself, have hit another home run. The birds of prey and girl power are alive and viciously kickin.",1
221,"While there is little new or innovative here (think Deadpool crossed w/ Captain Marvel), this movie is just plain fun. It also doesn't take itself seriously at all (a major flaw of almost all previous DC movies except WW). The one semi-major downside of the movie is the lack of a good villain. While Ewan McGregor chews through his lines with zeal, his character (along with his lackey Zsasz) lacks any depth or development or even any reason they are to be feared, beyond just being cruel to all the women around them. Don't listen to all the Incel idiots out there poo-pooing this movie! It is well worth a watch.",1
222,This movie is fun from the first scene. Very few movies are this enjoyable.,1
223,The film was much better than expected. Well-cast actors for the characters and lots of cool action scenes interspersed with comedy. Margot Robbie did a great job with Harley and Ewan McGregor was amazing as Black-mask.,1
224,This is one of the best comic movies i've ever seen! Who says they didn't like it is certainly a frustrated nerd.,1
225,Enough superhero movies. Movie is boring and cannot surprise you. We need more experimentation,0
226,Filme maravilhoso as cenas de ação estao incrivel a margot robbie esta incrivel no papel de harley quinn,1
227,"This is an amazing movie. Harley is so empowered, braced, beautiful and was very well interpreted by Margot Robbie. the film has been boycotted by stupid, macho nerds who are giving the film a low grade.",1
228,okay we shall start by saying that i personally absolutely loved the movie to death one of the most action packed and fast moving movies ive seen in awhile there is also huge humor and even a dash of heart so much going on too really enjoyable and you gotta love all the eye candy if your a guy like me so yeah its pretty much perfect i say see it see it see it,1
229,"Very fun movie, fresh and dynamic, awesome actin scene. One of the best from DC Universe. I passed a nice time watching it.",1
230,"Uma fotografia incrível, trilha sonora empolgante, e ver a emancipação das personagens é algo inspirador.",1
231,"DC really seems to be heading in the right direction recently, with films like Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam, and Joker realizing that sometimes all it takes to make a movie that people actually ENJOY is to, ya know, let the filmmakers realize their own vision and make the movie THEY want to make, no matter the tone or ratings. I am so glad that ""Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)"" is a film that follows suit.""Birds of Prey"" is maybe not the title I would have chosen for this film, because it is 100% a Harley Quinn movie. But if that doesn't bother you, then you're gonna have a hell of a good time with this one, because this is an excellent Harley Quinn film! BoP channels total Tarantino energy, with a storytelling style that feels very reminiscent of films like ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"", but viewed through the lense of a kaleidoscope. It manages to be totally feminist without crossing a line, as in it spreads its ""Girl Power"" attitude without shoving it down your throat. The cast and crew are majority female, but neither men nor women are treated worse on the basis of gender in the world itself (Wonder Woman handled this very well too). It has some of the most incredibly wild and fun action set-pieces with impressive in-camera stuntwork (courtesy of John Wick and Deadpool's incredible stunt team), I've seen in awhile in a CBM. There is also incredible set design, great camerawork, wonderful uses of color, perfectly endearing performances by the entire cast.Ewan McGreggor is a standout as the perfectly pathetic, scenery-chewing and menacing Black Mask, and Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary and Chris Messina as Victor Zsasz were very welcome surprises. Mary Elizabeth Winstead could have gotten more screentime as Huntress (hell, her story could've filled an entire movie on it's own), but when she's there, she kicks so much ass and is, quite frankly, adorably awkward in a way I couldn't have predicted. The rest of the cast is great as well (Rosie Perez and Amy Wong are great, and newcomer Eliza Jay-Basco is nice as well), but the MVP is without a doubt Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She continues to prove herself to be incredible in this role and is better than ever here, and here she really gets to delve a bit deeper than we might expect from her character (her background in psychology is used often to great effect). I cannot imagine any other actress filling her shoes, and I couldn't be happier to say that.Birds of Prey was as entertaining, fun, and wholly-Harley as I thought it could have ever been, and I am so glad to say that I loved this film and can't wait to see it again (Although it should've still been titled ""Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey"").",1
232,"I absolutely adored this film! It's action-packed and fast-paced, with a gripping storyline and a cast of complex, kick-ass characters. The soundtrack is killer, the choreographed combat scenes are hypnotic, and the sets are visually stunning. The twists might not surprise you, but I think the cast will still delight you. Ewan MacGregor is deliciously malicious as the Black Mask. Go see this movie if you like girls, violence, or girls committing acts of violence.",1
233,"Me gustó mucho la película. Tiene el toque de locura, ternura y violencia de Harley Quinn, tiene acción, traición, unión y me parece en general una buena historia.",1
234,Great fun movie! Margot Robbie is marvellous.Can’t wait for the next Wonder Woman,1
235,I absolutely loved this film! Didn’t really like the trailers but the film is so fun! The way they tell the story is also really interesting and the action is unique! Go see it!,1
236,"All the stupid kids will complain that this movie has lots of SJW propoganda, but it doesnt. It's not captain marvel. The movie is cool and chill.",1
237,Joy and technicolour carnage - it was just so much fun the whole way through.,1
238,"Birds of Prey was everything I had hoped it would be and so much more, it was a A+ movie. This is my favorite DC movie, my favorite antihero movie, my favorite movie of 2020, my 2nd favorite superhero and action movie of all time, and my 2nd favorite movie of all time. Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn was exceptional, one of the best performances I have ever seen. The supporting performances from Ewan McGregor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Ella Jay Basco, Chris Messina, and Rosie Perez were stupendous. The writing was phenomenal and the humor was hilarious, one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The costumes were remarkable especially the ones wore by Margot Robbie, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ewan McGregor, and Rosie Perez, I loved how amazingly unique, colorful, and cool all of the costumes were especially the ones wore by Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. The makeup and hairstyling was outstanding especially on Margot Robbie, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, Chris Messina, Ella Jay Basco, and Ewan McGregor. The music was excellent, I loved how they incorporated pop, hip hop, rock, heavy metal, r&b, and soul all into the movie and soundtrack. The soundtrack is my favorite DC movie soundtrack, my favorite antihero movie soundtrack, my 2nd favorite superhero movie soundtrack, one of my top 10 favorite action movie soundtracks, and one of my favorite movie soundtracks of all time. The visual effects were superb especially Bruce the Hyena and the ACE Chemicals explosion. I do not think that Birds of Prey could have been any better than it was.",1
239,"I absolutely loved this movie. Its honestly one of my favorite movies of all time now! Harley... omg... i cant believe how perfect she was and i am forever grateful to Margot Robbie for that. Black Canary felt SO REAL and brought SO MUCH heart to this movie. Huntress brought this fun mysterious element to the movie but then surprised with us with HILARIOUSLY endearing awkwardness. She had the least screentime, but somehow she's the one i can't stop thinking about and i want more. I cant express how perfectly Rosie Perez worked in this movie. I just loved Renee Montoya. And i really wish Ella Jay Basco's character had a different name because calling her Cassandra Cain does a disservice to that Character in the comics AND the character on screen. She's a great character who i really came to care for in this movie!! She could have easily been Holly Robinson and the problem would have been fixed. Theres so much more good to talk about like the pace, different layered tones, and writing and directing.... it was all top notch and i cant believe how perfectly each aspect complimented one another. 10/10 for me. Can't wait to see more from these characters",1
240,"This movie was surprisingly a fun and awesome comic book adaptation! Definitely a major step up from the disappointment which was Suicide Squad, this movie has incredible choreographed fight scenes, funny crude humor, and even creepy yet charming cool villain. The characters are interesting, though it would've been nice they had more character building and development, but still great characters with the time they are given. This movie and Harley Quinn may not be Deadpool, but is the closest and best thing that comes close to DC's version of Deadpool!",1
241,Great story and action. Great use of music. A little too graphic with the violence for my taste.,1
242,One of The best movies of DC Universe.Harley Quinn in The most ART possible,1
243,"THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. E V E R Y T H I N G. I loved all the details, the directing is outstanding, the way the story develops is incredible and remind us how crazy harley’s mind is. Perfect soundtrack and action scenes ARE .... OH MY GOD... AMAZING. I really want to be punched by dinah.",1
244,"BOP is a whole lot of fun, glitz, and glam! Probably DCEU’s most humor-filled entry. Robbie and the whole squad kicked ass with stunning fight sequences! 10/10",1
246,Don't listen to people that gave this movie 0 to 5 they just hating on DC...  it is a very good movie.. i like how they told Harley Quinn origin! The story and fights scenes was pretty good go watch it yourself and you be the judge on this movie,1
247,Birds of Prey stops just short of greatness. It's a well directed action movie with pretty good performances from the main cast (especially Ewan McGregor) but it's comedy also fails and it's attempt to tell a non-linear story just leads to a jumbled mess of a plot.,1
248,"incrível, foda, maravilhoso e empoderado! a atuação da margot está impecável, juntamente com a das outras atrizes, simplesmente incrível",1
249,"Окей, это не Джокер, но это НАМНОГО ЛУЧШЕ ЧЕМ ОТРЯД САМОУБИЙЦ. Уже за это я могу поставить 6 баллов. За превосходную игру Марго можно и ещё 2 накинуть и вишенкой на этом торте будет потрясающий экшн. Сюжет подкачал, как и второстепенные персонажи. Вообщем, неплохо.",1
250,Its a great movie of course if Margot Robbie is in it. Lots of fun and action,1
251,Once you take your biased opinions about the comic out of your viewing experience. You can enjoy yourself at this Harley Quinn movie. Enough said.,1
252,"Joker, The Dark Knight, and now Birds Of Prey! I watched them all in that order and enjoying this experience to no end.",1
253,"Perfect!! Margot Robbie was born to play Harley, such a wonderful perfomance. The other girls were amazing , and of course Ewan and Messina too. A must see!!",1
254,"Absolutely amazing movie. Well plotted, acted, choreographed, with beautiful sets and design choices. One of my favorites ever alongside Deadpool 2 and Wonder Woman. This movie didn't pull any punches when it comes to providing a-... at times disturbingly accurate picture of how horrific rich, entitled white men can be, so please take over-harsh negative reviews from men who are spoiled by seeing themselves in nearly every comic movie hero and therefore don't understand how to appreciate a movie where someone unlike them is the focus with a grain of salt.This movie was fun, hilarious, and had similar humor to Deadpool without being repetitive. It felt true to comic interpretations of Harley and Gotham City in general.  All the characters had their own motivations and reasons for being there, and no one felt like an unnecessary add-in. Cass Cain in particular, in this definitively alternate interpretation, is precious, well-acted, and has this When Did This Become My Life expression constantly which brought me such joy. 12/10, I was the target audience of this movie and I loved feeling heard. The casual lgbtq+ representation was wonderful. Marvel take notes.",1
255,This movie blew me away! I'm completely speechless. These women deserve the WORLD.,1
256,This movie was the best DC film I’ve seen. Most of the negative reviews are just from bitter dudes that didn’t even see the movie. Ignore them.,1
257,Awesome Movie!!,1
258,Its better than i expected ! The only thing i don’t like is they wasted Black Mask and killed him,1
259,"No, this isn't an 8/10 movie simply because it's a massive improvement over the dumpster fire that was ""Suicide Squad"". No, this is an 8/10 movie because Margot Robbie is perfection as Harley Quinn, the action is terrific (a little bit of ""John Wick"" vibes at certain points), it's deliciously over-the-top (Ewan McGregor's performance included) and our central characters are all memorable. It's a very good comic book movie on its own right.",1
260,Great action and lots of laughs.  What Suicide Squad should have been... violent and funny.,1
261,Really good time. Silly fun but with enough darkness and emotion to keep it from feeling too frivolous. Amazing fight and action choreography. All characters were wonderfully cast and portrayed.,1
262,"¡ES INCREÍBLE!, ame cada parte, los personajes y su desarrollo, los escenarios, las escenas de acción, el vestuario y maquillaje, la edición también es increíble, y aunque su peculiar narrativa pueda sentirse algo sosa, termina siendo muy divertida. Ver que hayan tomado un riesgo tan grande respecto a la película y que aún así haya funcionado bastante bien me hace esperar mucho más de estos personajes y sus historias, todos deberían darle una oportunidad.",1
263,Good but not perfect superhero movie with some unique and interesting stuff in it,1
264,"Como um filme tão divertido pode sofrer tanto hate? Bem que dizem, o nerd tem que acabar!",1
265,simplesmente lendario!! um marco na indústria audiovisual e um soco na cara de todos os incels do mundo,1
266,"My spoiler-free review of #BirdsOfPrey:The most artistic, bloody, colorful DC movie yet. Thanks to a bold vision from director Cathy Yan and a grand ensemble with Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn along with Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, and Ella Jay Basco, Birds of Prey is a action-packed bloody fun time. The best part of the movie is the opening scene that Warner Bros. Animation contributed to. And, the movie deserved it’s R-rating, box office be damned (Better not screw with James Gunn if he wants The Suicide Squad R-rated over the financial fate of this movie, Warner Bros). Now, I can understand why people may not like Roman Sionis/Black Mask, given the sort of horrific things he does to Gotham City’s innocents in this movie, but, I do think it’s a way to sort of distinguish him from the Joker as Mr. J wanted to watch the world burn, whereas Roman had a purpose for doing what he did: power. And, I think Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi himself) gave a spectacular performance of an inhumane villain that reflects who we deal with today. I think it’s really worth seeing in IMAX and you should check it out.My final rating: 5 stars out 5. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",1
267,"Director Cathy Yan packs Birds of Prey full of colorful energy and creative action. Its fight choreography separates it from the more drab comic book movie fare, and it has legitimately funny moments. However, with its foot firmly on the pedal, it too often races ahead into cringeworthy humor and extraneous exposition. Birds of Prey hopes the sugar rush does not wear off until the credits roll, and for the most part it succeeds. However, it is impossible not to notice the bloat.",1
268,"AMAZING!!! I wanna see it again, they're so incredible and i'm so proud. Amazing",1
269,Fabulous work of art once again killing the stereotype that women cannot be badass and funny,1
270,"Birds of prey is a blast! the fight scenes are amazing and the movie looks gorgeous... it has a quentin Tarantino vibe to it but it's still very original .. if you like crazy fun visuals and things like sunset overdrive , inglorious bastards and kill bill then you will love this movie. Margot Robbie  is born to play harley Quinn  she embodies the role so well, other actors play characters but Margot Robbie IS Harley Quinn! she completely understands the character her fight scenes are amazing and very harley quinn its realy a joy to watch. Black mask is a fun villian him and victor zsasz are strangely hilarious... Huntress is a badass and her backstory is interesting... overall the movie is really fun and i can't wait to see what they do next hopefully Cathy Yan and Margot Robbie will make another movie with Harley Quinn",1
271,"It's not a politically correct movie. Some people are just criticizing the movie and haven't seen it just trash fanboys. The movie doesn't follow by rule the comics but it's a good spin on it. The action sequences are on point and if you're into black humor, you're going to love this.",1
272,"Amazing film that doesn't follow the captain marvel route. Instead of saying IM a WaHmeN, the movie just tells a classic dc story of birds of prey. Cool action and funnily innapropriate!!!",1
273,Amazing Action pack thrill it was one of the best dc movies.Action Packed fun filled movie there was a ton of Harley Quinn which I loved but many did't which i understand but the movie is really funny and totally worth the wait.,1
274,"I really enjoyed it!The characters may not be extremely comics accurate, with one being rather loosely adapted, but they stayed pretty true to the basics. It was a fun ride with great action sequences and jokes. And it didn't have any kind of pushy ""wokeness"" that people keep complaining about. It's a great film, in a series now from DC. Aquaman, Shazam!, Joker, and now this! I'm hoping for more!Go see this one!",1
275,"I really liked this movie, more than I thought i would, its a harley queen movie plus the birds of prey, thats not bad, because all the birds of prey have their time to shine, and they shine really bright, but brighter that them all is Harley, Margot is terrific in this movie and she is so well written. Black Mask is a great villain and McGregor does a great job, so is Zsasz, he is really scary. The action in this movie is so fluid and well choreographed and the story is so much fun. I just don’t really like when a movie keeps shifting between present and past and in the beginning of the movie this happened, i got used to it, i just didn’t liked it. The soundtrack is amazing, all of the fabulous original songs are great. Yeah this is one of the best superheroes movie and among the best Dc movies",1
276,"Wow!absolutely insane ride cinematography is eye catching soundtracks are catchy and great score is none the less it was awesome,action was great,performances are really great,only complaint is that why this movie got over quickly i wanting to watch more of black mask and rest of team!pacing of movie is good enough to keep insaneness high!at last a great movie experience!",1
277,"A brilliant, funny, crazy film told by Harley Quinn herself. If you love films like Deadpool or John Wick, this is the film to watch. Margot Robbie was born to play Harley. I just hope they make a sequel, I want to see more Birds of Prey.",1
278,"Its actually really good lol,u guys should go to the theater and watch itttt",1
279,Such a fun and eletric movie with great character development (except from the Helena Bertinelli),1
280,"Absolutely Fantastic. The cast kills it. Margot shines as Harley, Perez plays the role of 80s cop fantastically, Winstead is a wonderful Huntress, Jurnee is a delightful Canary, and Basco nails a young Cassandra. They are foiled by the delightfully evil Ewan who is in turn supported by his own loyal lackey in Messina. The movie is a delightful ride from start to finish.",1
281,Как комедия на вечерок  фильм полностью окупается. Большего от него нечего и ждать. Я в принципе на него так и шёл и не разочаровался.,1
282,"It's funny and joyful, Margot Robbie, Jurnee Smollett Bell and Ewan McGregor are the best characters",1
283,Perfeitas a surra nos machos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.................................,1
284,an empowering and exciting movie. margot's performance was **** incredible. absolutely loved it x,1
285,"Led by an enthusiastic performance we've come to expect from Margot Robbie, Birds of Prey manages to elevate its generic plot with well-choreographed action and entertaining characters who prove to be a welcome addition to the DC Universe.",1
286,"Fun, badass and refreshing, this movie respects Harley's spirit from her more recent comic runs, especially her solo series. The fights felt real and really freaking cool, and not in the boring femme fatale way that male directors keep giving us with characters like Black Widow. The characters designs looked cool and wearable, and all of them were extremely hot (special shout out to roman's gold look and eyeliner). I'm so thankful for this portrayal of the Rogues as colourful, dramatic and violent, and having interpersonal relationships, not just a series of completely unaffiliated guys with guns and a tame aesthetic, like we've seen before. I hope future portrayals will be in the same vein, and not just forgettable mini bosses. I also loved that we actually saw a lot of Gotham, its citizens and their relationships with the more infamous Gothamites. The city is almost a character in its own right in the comics, but in the movies it often feels as if it was only a backdrop, an afterthought, and that the story could be set anywhere else. I do wish they hadn't tried to pretend that this was Cassandra Cain, because it isn't and it's weird to put her in this story, but she was a cool kid and it was easy enough for me to pretend like she was just a kid named Cass and still enjoy myself. This movie gives me hope for the future of DC's live-actions adaptations, I really hope it's not a one-time thing. I'm excited to see what comes next.",1
287,"I loved this movie so much, first of all shows that harley is way more than a sexy body and shows that she's a smart funny smart woman. The movie has funny moments. Emotional ones as well. It shows how men take advantage of her all the time, and how she brakes those chains to men objectification and just stops idea that she needs men protection!! I think this movie is so importante! Every bad review that I've seen so far is or by men, that don't understand the importance of this movie. That is not harley as a sexy ass girl. And bad reviews of marvel baby's. Comparing to marvel. Dc is Dc. Just leave it alone don't compare. I think everyone would enjoy this lovie",1
288,"Great movie loved the girl power in all of it I loved how there was a back story to every character, now yes it does start to get repetitive every time a new character or past event needs to come up to help the viewer understand but I think it still adds a few good moments to the movie so we can get the full backstory. I also think Margot Robbie is amazing as many others do especially as Harley. Another complaint though is that the black mask (main villain) is just a mustache twirling villain no backstory or anything he’s just a douche. Anyway a great movie definitely recommend to anyone reading this 9/10",1
289,"Não se deixe levar por críticas negativas de pessoas que não gostaram do filme somente por ser uma produção da Warner/DC ou por ser um filme protagonizado por mulheres, com muito girl power e 0 sexualização! O filme é incrível, tem um roteiro muito bom, um excelentíssimo elenco e personagens maravilhosos, além de que um (se não o melhor) vilão do DCEU se encontra neste longa! Dê uma chance para Aves de Rapina e se possível vá ver e tire suas próprias conclusões sobre o filme, mas cá entre nós, acredito que mais da maioria irá gostar e muito deste filme!Don't get carried away by negative reviews from people who didn't like the film just because it is a Warner / DC production or because it is a film starring women, with a lot of girl power and 0 sexualization! The film is incredible, it has a very good script, an excellent cast and wonderful characters, and a (if not the best) DCEU villain is in this feature! Give Birds of Prey a chance and if possible go and see your own conclusions about the film, but here among us, I believe that most of the majority will like this film a lot!",1
290,"o filme é de longe um dos melhores da DC, canas de ação bem produzidas, as coreografias das lutas estão impecáveis e no quesito fidelidade aos quadrinhos com certeza é o filme da DC mais fiel as HQs não liguem para críticas ruins vai ver e tirar suas conclusões vcs mesmos, mas eu garante que se forem n vão se arrepender a única coisa ruim no filme é que ele acaba pq até agora eu tô com gostinhobde quero mais e tô torcendo muito pra ter uma sequência",1
291,"I loved the movie, it was a big step up from Suicide Squad, and a fun little side adventure for Harley Quinn. The fight scenes were great and the actors were fantastic in the movie. One of the best DC movies in my opinion.",1
292,"Filme bem produzido, ótima trilha sonora, fotografia e atuação. Fiquei impressionada, parece que estou realmente lendo uma HQ. Simplesmente perfeito",1
293,"What a movie! It's amazing. I just feel Margo's act. BGM skill, movie plot & fighting skill just wow",1
294,"I enjoyed watching this movie, great acting, acting and the directing. I thought it was beautiful movie the female birds",1
295,Im not usually a fan of movies but this was an extremely amazing action packed film. Decent plot great characters with great development and thrilling scenes. Some people may argue it's not good but for me it's definitely a must watch,1
296,"The film is excellent, it is a kind of Deadpool but more colorful and funny and with much better action scenes. Honestly it is one of the ""superheroes"" movies that I have seen to date, the only problem I see in the movie is that it does not look so much like comics, but personally I prefer an original adaptation to a comic book. Please, stop believing all the negative comments about the movie, there are always haters trying to discredit good movies for the simple fact that it was not what they wanted. The movie has nothing feminist, inclusion or anything (I don't see the problem if I had it). Watch it, enjoy it and judge it for yourselves ^. ^ ❤️",1
297,"Normally don't leave reviews on metacritic but I feel compelled to stand on a soap box and shout after reading some of the review these from these man babies review bombing this movie. Because apperantly even casting female leads in a movie is PoLtIcAlY cOrReCt CuLtUaRL gone too far. This movie is super solid, is it joker? No. But it's a lot of dumb fun and well and if you enjoyed aquaman you'll enjoy this. Super well shot and  well performed fight scenes. Margot Robbie and the extended cast is a lot of fun, I'd like to have seen more of them. Especially huntress. Black Mask is a kind of one trick pony, him being an awful mysognist. But it's super apparent Ewan McGregor is really turning up the ham to play this terrible terrible man and is having alot of fun doing it. It's not some kind of Apocalyptic. **** up like Ghostbusters 2016.",1
298,"Fun, frenetic action that leads you out of breath. Genuinely interesting characters mixed with the enticing plot makes this one of DC's best films ever. Yeah. And no, this isn't man hating trash from a 'woke' era. Watch it and enjoy.",1
299,"Cathy Yan's attempt at bringing the birds together is more like a 'throw on the wall attempt' to see what sticks and it works to a greater extent. What's more relieving is that the central character reprises her role after Suicide Squad and whose shoulders the movie rests on mainly. The narrative starts from her central piece to introduce four other new characters in which the Huntress turns out to stand out among the rest with Black Canary laying out the surprise element. The fight choreography is top notch and the stunts well executed owing to the mastermind behind the action sequences of John Wick series. All this helps the movie to hit the lid on cylinders considering the fact that it has subtle references to the movies before it in the same universe, Sucide Squad being the highlight.",1
