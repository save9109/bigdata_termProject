0,"As a fan of the series so far I went into this film with a little apprehension. It's usually the third film that they tend to screw things up but honestly, this exceeded my expectations in every way and was a delightful watch. The introduction to sci-fi elements felt quite natural and the exploration of eugenic-themed politics was done with shocking subtlety. Unlike the previous films, that felt like they their settings lacked explanation, Allegiant explains enough that you feel you understand where everything is and what's happening, without making it obvious whether certain conspiracies or opinions are correct. The overall message isn't clearly for or against genetic modification either, which means it doesn't feel like the film is pushing it's political ideals at you, nor is it's politics a clear allegory for something in modern politics; though it could be interpreted that way. This is good as it means you don't have to be of one political persuasion to enjoy it and it could so easily have gone that way. So far this franchise has been a happy surprise for me as following films like Hunger Games and Twilight, I had presumed that the ""young adult"" adaptations where all going to be cringe-worthy. This franchise however had been consistently good and I look forward to the next one.",1
3,Its more adolescent nonsense to exploit teenage girls that will go over anything that has young handsome guys and girls engage in some fantasy crap. End it already!,0
4,"Terribly cliche movie, TV commercial is the worst I've ever seen, trailer is pretty much the whole movie summed up, and a poor screenplay. This film deserves nothing more than a 1, if someone argues well enough. Sure, fans of the book might enjoy, but that's as far as it goes.",0
6,"I will admit I went into Allegiant with really low expectations.  I saw the first two and gave them low ratings as I thought they were dull and lacked the enthusiasm and excitement of the Hunger Game series.  The stories were hard to follow in Divergent and Insurgent and were uninspired.  This one felt different and the storyline and action finally came together for me.  If you have endured the first two and felt like me, go see the third installment as I was pleasantly surprised.  Actually looking forward to the second part now.  To be honest I went with the friend because he had a free ticket and I was going for the popcorn.  The movie actually being good and finally coming together was a bonus!!!",1
8,"Young girl, beautiful and intelligent, but different from the rest, soon learns that she is the sole hope for saving the entire world. Where have we heard that before? This is what this movie is, its just so painfully predictable, even the things the characters say. Youve got the cliche ""just two days from retirement"" chracter deaths, obviously evil but portrayed as good middle aged balding men, you've got imaginative CGI futuristic orange bubbles that cleanse the radioactive crap from the main protagonists bodies, You've even got a character that can tell if a puddle of water is radioactive, just by looking at it! Wtf? The acting is wooden, even from the extras. I actually found the execution at the beginning to be hilarious as the extras were so terrible, waving their hands around like slightly to moderately concerned individuals at bingo. At one point my brother said to me ""hey didnt we see this movie before"" and i was like ""nah that was the scorch trials"" and he was like ""nah the other one"" and I was like ""the hunger games"" and he was like ""nah man, the one where the girl saves the world from the bad guy"" and i was like ""oh yeah you mean the mortal instruments?"" and he was like ""nah man the other one"".",0
9,I'm not angry with Divergent anymore i'm just bored with it. I'd say that the plot causes the franchise to go off the rails but that implies it ever got on the rails in the first place. Allegiant has no choice but to rip off the Maze Runner after Insurgent pretty much ran whatever originality the series had with it's concept into the ground (which even then felt like it was ripping off the Hunger Games). the plot is so confusing and makes no sense and has to establish everything again which it does poorly and i also believe fans of the book will be aggravated by the changes from the source material especially splitting the final book into 2 films. the cast also show real visible disdain for material they've been given including newcomer Jeff Daniels who really looks like he doesn't want to be there and Miles Teller is still really annoying . it's a mess there's no other way of looking at it. i was never that big a fan The Hunger Games but this series as well as The 5th Wave makes me pine for it,0
10,"Congratulations to Jeff Daniels - having done Dumb and Dumber, you've now participated in Dumbest. Honestly the worst thing I've had to suffer through in a theater in recent memory. Having quite enjoyed the first movie, I approached this one with the wide-eyed innocence of the lamb being conveyor-belted to the saw blade. Imagine my surprise upon being assaulted by a nonsensical plot, awful 2D characters and even garbage special effects. Also, Ladies and Gentlemen - let's pause for a moment to take on a special feeling of disdain for the acting. In particular, Triss' delivery of ""maybe they're here to rescue us?"" which was delivered with all the emotion and poise of a preschooler reading aloud to class (apologies to all the preschoolers out there). It's sad that this festering turd of a movie will ride the popularity wave of the books and do quite well for itself. It is most certainly not deserved. Avoid at all costs.",0
11,"As with The Hunger Games, another series finale that is going to suffer from being dragged out into two parts. Allegiant is slow, dull, redundant and stale. The extended story line has destroyed the pace of the last two films and has opened up holes in the story line. When part 2 of part 3 comes out, hopefully it will find its legs again.",0
12,"Aren't we already tired of this continuing series that manages to exist for only money at the box office? That's what I thought. With Allegiant, things are starting to get old and the Divergent Series manages to overstay its welcome by wearing off its greatness from the first installment even though Divergent hardly had any greatness anyways.",0
13,"When I walked into The Divergent Series: Allegiant, I had very low expectations. But, the film turned out to be even worse. The acting is dull, the plotline is week, and the film itself is just boring.",0
14,"Allegiant is the best film in the franchise! Even though I read all the books I was still on edge through the entire movie. And to be honest, Shailene, Theo and Chloe never seem to disappoint.",1
15,"This movie is absolute **** The characters are bland and have no personality, the special effects are terrible, and it is trying too hard to be the hunger games. The dialogue and jokes seem like they were written by a five year old. The plot is incredibly formulated and quite frankly, stupid. The only reason you should watch this movie is if you want to get cancer.",0
16,""" Allegiant "" was a very bad , seriously boring , bad film photography , as the "" Divergent "" series focused on what we wanted to focus on Allegiant but I did not understand the story, a little saturated and stay with flavorless",0
17,"Simply Brilliant! Best episode in the Divergent series. Love the TRON & Mass Effect twist to the story arc. This new high-tech Sci-Fi feel to the series is certainly uplifting and refreshing (somehow audience in general don't like change). Never liked the old, rusty distopian feel of the earlier two episodes. With the stage now set for an epic battle against the Pure, I'm eagerly awaiting with anticipation for the final episode. Bring it on! ;)",1
18,No no no! This was a horrid movie! Who could sit and watch this mess of a film without walking out or falling asleep. Big disappointment. See something else!,0
21,"I thought this would be a good movie in the vein of the Hunger Games. Boy, was I wrong. It was cliched, poorly scripted, and bad acting, and would be better off as a SyFy Original. Mega thumbs down :(",0
23,"Just when you think the series can't get any worse, this movie comes up. Woodley's performance is dull in every single way. The plot is torn apart in billion pieces. THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE.",0
24,Worst movie I've ever seen. Big waste of time. Bad acting and reminded me of something off of SyFy. I'm surprised this isn't a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. :(,0
25,I'm not even sure where they got their movie plot...certainly didn't even remotely follow the storyline..its embarrassing that they would try and name this movie after the book,0
26,"The movie was pretty good overall. I have to applaud the actors on an amazing job of acting. However, i wasn't expecting that the rumors on a fourth movie coming out to be true. I was hoping they'd ""stick to the script"" by keeping only three movies, but maybe this next movie will make my assumptions wrong. Loved the movie. Totally awesome! Must SEE!",1
27,"I actually wouldn't call it bad movie! It was better  that the second one and around the same as the first. While the plot sometimes does have issues and some things just don't quite make sense, it was highly entertaining. I think everyone did a good job and there was one particular scene where I thought they did have a very good and thrilling job. Overall, it was a pretty good film to see with your friends and if you liked the first two, you would most likely like this one. (87/100)",1
28,"Allegiant ? More like a detergent. Wash up our evenly little interest to take a look at this pile of crap. Never interested since the trailer of first movie.",0
29,"Allegiant is unoriginal, bland, dull and a complete embarrassment to the source material that it's based on. I can't wait for these teens novel adaptations to go extinct.",0
30,"I went to the movies with low expectations after seeing the weak outcome of The Hunger Games . However , I discovered that the Divergent Saga has action, romance and an interesting plot that keeps the viewer intrigued throughout the movie . I do not understand why so much negative criticism because it is an action film with a good cast .",1
33,"La saga va de mal en peor. No leí el libro para juzgar pero la película ha sido muy vacía y muy predecible. Para ser una guerra civil solo hubo 4 muertes, y solo de un personaje destacable que igual no era la gran cosa. La traición de Peter, el perdón de Tris a su hermano, la mentira de David, todo es muy predecible y aburrido. Lo peor de la película fue el asesinato despiadado a cientos de personas en el final, tirando la nave a la base y que mate a todos, y los personajes simplemente sonrían y festejen cuando al principio abandonaron Chicago por estar en contra de la muerte. Lo único que destaco es el personaje sarcástico y malvado de Peter que siempre es grato ver. El resto de personajes, para mal. Los efectos de la película si que fueron bastante buenos y es lo único que destaca de la película. En resumen, la película es muy aburrida y densa, y las escenas interesantes solo fue la pelea del final, la cual fue bastante corta.",0
34,"I don't know what they had in mind when they made this movie, but it is nothing like the book. the pace of this movie is also weird and they lose touch on emotions halfway through. still worth the watch if you really keep up and slow down with the awkward pace. also try to pay attention to the plot and ignore the repetitive (and i mean repetitive) cgi action. Other than that it is really not an entertaining movie with a weird pace and confusing plot.",0
35,"Awful,dull,stupid,annoying,bad,stupid,horrible.I could do this all day.There isn't a single good  performance.This movie is the worst thing i have seen in my life.",0
36,"Spectacular! Great plot and amazing cast. Divergent's fans will enjoy this experience. Shailene Woodley gives the character kindness and courage , while Jeff Daniels as David gives humanity to one of the new enemies of this saga, which in my opinion has one of the best ideas of youth dystopia .",1
37,A film specially dedicated for movie fans with an exciting plot and a cast that shines all times. I really liked and Shailene Woodley is spectacular as Tris.,1
38,"This movie embodies the very thing I hate about movies. The thing that popular books need to be converted into poorly done movies, with **** ass acting. No one in this movie seemed to give a **** about it, except maybe Miles Teller, who I thought was just trying to have fun with it. There are good YA books out there, and Fault in Our Stars showed us they can be made into good enough movies, but this is just the plot of Hunger Games recycled, with a little bit of changeover, so that it seems ""original"". And to think I kind of liked the first one. That's the thing about trilogies though, either they can awesome and super well formed, like the Kung Fu Panda trilogy, or suck like these three movies(or the Taken trilogy, for that matter). All in all, listen to everyone on this website and save yourself some money.",0
39,This films predecessor's are bad no matter what but this film is pure garbage. This film have become worse and worse and I am tired of it.The maze runner is also bad but The divergent series is the worse.,0
41,A pile of garbage and ridiculously stupid from start to finish...........................................................................................................................,0
42,"Surprisingly smart and fast-paced, but fatally flawed and cliched, Allegiant just continues it's predecessors steps in an every-time-worse way, also thanks to it's dull storytelling that lacks a good point of view to it's cast.",0
43,"I really loved this movie. I do not know why there was so much hate and disdain for a movie like this. the cast is great, and the plot generally over all kept to the book. I really enjoyed it and I am sure everyone else did too...",1
44,"They were going mediocre for the first two, and now they are going bad. The quality is really off for this one; bad acting, bad story, bad visual effects, and tons of badness. The only real redeeming quality of this movie is some of its ideas, but other than that, it sucks.",0
45,"I enjoyed the first two films and was expecting to like this too, but the franchise seems to have gone off the rails for some reason. The plot seemed a bit dumbed down from the previous movies but even so was pretty nonsensical. I was able to suspend my disbelief for the first two films but this one just seemed a bit more silly and the action sequences were pretty contrived and lacked any real threat to the characters, although one of the characters at the start of the movie got shot by a bullet that could apparently change direction at will, seeing as she was standing away from the edge of a really large wall and got shot by someone at the bottom. It just went downhill from that point onwards. Just about worth watching if you have watched the previous two films, but otherwise its a pretty lame film in its own right.",0
47,"The Divergent Series: Allegiant renders the Divergent Series redundant with another completely forgettable installment in the franchise. One note-characters, obvious use of green screen and terrible dialogue contribute. At least it wasn't boring.",0
48,"Alright look. Modern professional criticism is not worth your time. Metacritic exists solely to divide professional critique, and individual critique. Several of the reviews list the CGI as unimpressive. They are mistaken, and are improperly defining, what is really a ""simplistic futuristic cyperpunk"" style. The film is beautiful. From its breathtaking sunsets on the destroyed crumbling buildings of Chicago, to the floating pure city of providence, Allegiant is much a visual ride such as Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack is very overwhelming, especially for fans of deep cyberpunk tonality. The cast is less than worthy of the film. However, Shailene Woodley has greatly improved throughout the series. My least favorite pick was Miles Teller as Peter. Enjoy the movie. Disregard professional critics. It is a business practice for them to drive you away from films that do not impress box office results.",1
50,Another underwhelming movie from the Divergent series. Just like the previous 2 it seems like no one is actually trying and there to just collect a paycheck. Some points make zero sense at at when they reach the end credits which had no conclusion to an apparent conclusion of the series.,0
53,I was so disappointed with the acting in this movie and it doesn't compare to the previous divergent series movies in my opinion. I won't be watching anymore divergent movies when they come out in the future as i believe they will be the same level of disappointment as this movie. I do not recommend anyone to buy or watch this rubbish.,0
54,A troca de diretor fez com que a história se perdesse e fosse parar em um rumo totalmente diferente do que foi escrito. Não adianta colocar milhares de efeitos especiais se a história não for boa com o livro. Decepcionante.,0
57,"While, definitely the worst of the Divergent Series, it still kept me interested the whole way through, even though it did stray from the book a lot. Allegiant could have been better, I think it is a satisfying prelude but actually, the conclusion since Ascendant won't be happening, which is very disappointing. Besides some horrible and very noticeable performances by background characters and straying from the book, Allegiant is really good!",1
59,"I tried to like the first two. And they weren’t the worse. But this, this is just disgusting. Even more so predictable and the dialouge and acting has been turned down about fifty notches. Rating - 15%",0
60,Very disappointed. The acting is sub par and the ending is unforgivingly anti climactic. Most of everything that happens throughout this film was painfully predictable. The most anticipated film in the series yet the most disappointing one.,0
61,"This is the second last film in this franchise, meaning that it should be more gripping and stirring than previous entries. Unfortunately, it is the dullest entry in the series yet.",0
62,"I can only say that I loved watching this movie, along with my family, and it caught our attention. Thanks to the production team, for all the moments of pleasure created.In short, against critics, I and my family have been excited about this movie!",1
64,"I didn’t think it could get worse but it did. I heard people like the novel but the movie is so predictable, this can’t be how the novel is right? There is absolutely no drama or suspense because it is just so cliche. How the ridiculous is it that Tris overcomes one massive conspiracy and rises above it in the first two movies to fall for another massive conspiracy. I’m not saying that it needed to be different but please be more creative, if not in substance at least In execution.",0
