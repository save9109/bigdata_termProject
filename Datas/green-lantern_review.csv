0,"I came into the movie expecting it to be bad but reasonable summer movie entertainment. Being an avid metacritic reader, I was fully aware of score of 40 and the bashing the critics gave this movie. What drove me to what the movie was the trailer (which seemed reasonable) and the fact that the user score was 6.7, suggesting that this movie is full of mindless but fun action.And how I was wrong. Really Really wrong.This movie lacks action. For a movie about a lantern who's powers were only limited by ones imagination; a fittingly ironic plot considering the lack of imagination in the writing, storytelling, acting and CGI found in this movie.  I counted only 3 action scenes of 30 secs each in this whole movie, all of them nicely summarized in the trailer. On might thing me shallow and argue that a focus on character development could be interesting, like in Ironman. This would be possible if not for the terrible writing AND acting in the story. None of the characters were believable if you are over the age of 6. I guess knowledge of the characters prior to the movie might help fill in the backstory which was never really explored in the movie. It seems mos of the people who enjoyed the movie were fans that grew up with GL. Unfortunately for me I do not fit this category . Honestly, 10 minutes into the movie I was already bored. The actors were all cliches and none of them were even convincing. The same plot lines were repeated around 30 times and again and again. I honestly felt like walking out of the cinema because it was that bad. Overall, stay far far away from Green Garbage and watch Xmen again if you have to.I feel bad for contributing to the revenue of this movie. For those who enjoyed this comic, watch it and feel free to disregard what I say.",0
3,"This movie's special effects are super good and this movie also features quite a lot of action. I did not really like Hal Jordan's suit in this movie as it looked like it exposed too much of his flesh. Nonetheless, the character is great in this movie. Overall, this is a good movie.",1
4,"While I can see why many critics disliked it, Green Lantern is NOT deserving of the bashing it's been getting.The superpower of being able to create anything you could imagine through willpower has, in my opinion, always been unbeatable in terms of HOW COOL IS THAT? I knew going into the theatre that although it probably wouldn't be executed as well as I would have liked, a story like Green Lantern couldn't possibly fall into the ""been there, done that"" list of superhero movies. I've took notice when I first began reading comics that DC characters tend to be more fantastic and space-bound than Marvel, which tends to focus on internal issues. So far, DC hasn't had as many shots as Marvel in films outside of their Batman/Superman franchises, so I was really hoping Green Lantern would be new and exciting.It was disappointing, yes, but it's definitely not a borefest to the average moviegoer with no invested interest in the comics or characters. It's action-packed, funny, very cool powers with very cool effects, romantic, and certainly fresh in the sense that I can't recall any other superhero movie that's been released that had a place like Oa be a major part of the storyline. I also want to mention that as a female comic book fan, I tend to take notice of how the female leads are treated throughout the movies. In the past few decades, I've never really been all that impressed by the love interests outside of Lois Lane. Before the movie was even announced, I had already known that the only iconic characters that would be able to hold  a candle to Lois would be from DC. I had high hopes for Carol Ferris, and while she wasn't executed all that well, she's still impressive to me. There wasn't much focus on it, but I think more people should consider that she's a pilot and is business savvy. Having seen films like Spider-Man accurately portray Mary-Jane Watson and keep her as a plot tool lead the way to comic book movie formulas, for me, the fact that Carol saved Hal from death counts for something.I'll hold off on saying I loved the Carol in the movie, but the writing made her recognizable as Carol Ferris, and simply because there haven't been many women in comic book movies that have impressed me, I'm going to give Carol Ferris the credit I would never give to characters like Mary-Jane Watson, Pepper Potts, Betty Ross, or Jane Foster etc. The DC women I feel I can respect and look up to, and I'm very glad to add Carol Ferris onto that list with Lois Lane. I expect the same for Catwoman in the next Batman installment. Overall, the movie is very what much what you expect from the trailers. Yes, it probably could have been the next Star Wars and is one of the only comic book franchises with that type of potential, but it wasn't. However, just because of that, it doesn't mean that this film should be bashed because Thor or X-Men: First Class handled themselves better, in my opinion. Green Lantern at it's best would blow everything else out of the water. At it's mediocre, it's on par with the rest of them.This is, of course, speaking in the context of what I was looking for when I went to see it.",1
6,"Not the greatest hero flick I've ever seen, but it's enjoyable.  I thought Ryan Reynolds did a good job as Hal, and Peter Sarsgard's perfomance as Hector Hammond was great. I also couldn't get over the scenes on the beautiful planet Oa. Hopefully the sequel (yes, there will be a sequel; if you sit through the credits for a little while, you'll learn this) will be a little better.",1
7,"This was a really good movie. I didn't read any reviews before I saw it so my expectations were unaffected. I was hoping for a good eye popping visual feast with a cast that didn't disappoint. Well it was a good as I hoped. The acting avoided the cheesiness that sometimes plagues films like this. I was pleasantly surprised that during the relatively lighthearted moments (read: not dark like Batman) it still maintained seriousness and the characters never crossed the line on believability with overacting. By comparison this movie was better than THOR in my opinion. The only thing I can critique is that it was a little short. They could have added about 20 minutes to flesh out the character development a bit more, but overall it still worked pretty well. I thought Ryan Reynolds did a good job. His character seemed like an unassuming approachable guy that got chucked into this role of responsibility, but had the raw potential to be a hero under the right circumstances. It was believable in a similar way as Peter Parker in Spiderman, but more so because Hal wasn't a dork to start ou with. Heck in costume Reynolds even looks like Lantern in the comics. I think he was a good choice ultimately. I can't wait for the sequel. If you were lucky enough and stayed for the closing credits you had a chance to see Sinestro put that yellow ring of fear on and bask in it's evil. Smells like sequel materiL to me. Can't wait..",1
8,"To telll the truth, after reading some truly savage reviews by some of the critics I have learned to trust, I intended to skip this film.  But as a kid I loved Green Lantern more than Superman, Batman and Supergirl combined.  After Wonder Woman GL was my fave. Now I'll tell you right off, this IS the film to leave the deepest part of your brain home.  Don't expect deep thought or, y'know, ideas.  This is a comic book.  Come to life.  That's all. That said, its a whiz-bang, crazy wild ride.  Whether you're riding in the **** of a fighter jet with an experimental robot plane hot on your exhaust or you've encountered a dying, handsome purple alien who has just given you the mother of all crackerjack prizes--and a free charger to boot--if you're Blake Lively's title character Hal Jordan you've got just the right aw, gee-ness to carry it off. Lively's Hal isn't a great brain, but he's a brave guy and a s**t hot seat-of-the-pants pilot.  And the flying scenes in and out of vehicles make me want a power ring of my own.  All the necessary plot points are here, the plucky girlfriend, the staunch buddy and the evilest evil since Sauron.  And then there's the Green Lantern Corps.  Not since Luke Skywalker strolled into the cantina have such an amazing array of alien life forms been gathered together.  And here Hal makes some friends.  I won't tell you about them lest I spoil the fun. If you want intellectualism, check out anything by Lars von Trier.  If you want a rollicking good time to go with your popcorn--see Green Lantern.",1
9,"Although the cheese factor takes away from the story at times (not surprising given the lead actor) it was refreshing to see a superhero movie that is proud to be just that. Green Lantern isn't afraid of its spandex, or colorful alien backdrops. When Hollywood attempts to make larger than life icons more realistic for the average audience (such as turning the X-Men into a biker gang, Galactus into a large ominous cloud or beefing up the Batman by sporting him in armor) they only seem to succeed in producing a less believable action flick instead of what we wanted to see: a silver screen adaptation of the well-rounded comic book crime fighters we love",1
10,"First thing I need to say is this is not a thinking movie. It's a superhero flick. So if your intention is to watch a movie that'll make you feel warm and fuzzy, or make you cry, or make you ponder the nature of life, don't see this. What this movie is, is an exceptional representation of an iconic superhero, which is a rarity today. I had initial concerns about Ryan Reynolds playing Hal Jordan as he's a very quirky actor, but he pulled it off well. Carol Ferris wasn't as well played, but she was still passable. What really struck me about this movie was how it really stayed true to the origin of the green lantern and yet at the same time dumbed it down for casual audiences. As a for instance, those of you who have read the comics know that Parallax's backstory is long and complicated and one can't really understand it without understanding the war of light, but the movie makes a few minor changes and makes him an acceptable villain to someone who hasn't followed the comics. This is getting a little long-winded, but what it boils down to is Green Lantern is DC's Iron Man: A healthy amount of action, true to the origin, accessible by both long-term fans and casual viewers, and not too much cheesy crap.",1
11,"I thought the movie was very good.  The pacing as great as it seemed like there was never a dull moment.  There was excellent balance between action scenes and story development, humor and seriousness, as well as internal and external conflicts.  I think it's a shame the movie seems to be getting the low scores it's getting.  I thought this was not only a good super hero movie, but a pretty good science fiction movie as well.  It is definitely worth seeing for yourself.",1
12,"I may not be a huge Green Lantern comic  book fan, but Ryan Reynolds delivered in his role as Hal Jordan. I'm not quite sure why the critics have been bashing this movie, because it's a pretty solid popcorn movie. If you're expecting Citizen Kane from Green Lantern, then you've only got yourself to blame.  A solid superhero movie and pure escapism!",1
14,"I saw Green Lantern with a number of friends, one new to the character.  We all agreed it was a fun movie and good story.  Basically the reviewers got it wrong, not even sure the reviewers watched the same movie as we did. Overall a good time.",1
15,"I enjoyed Green Lantern. So the pacing was all over the place, they overloaded on exposition and they stuffed too much into one movie. I still really liked it. It was a shame it wasn't closer to the original mythology, because I think that the story suffered where they strayed from the comics, and there was really no reason to. Hopefully the relatively negative response from critics won't discouraging DC from putting some more second and third tier characters on the big screen. In the end, I found the movie pretty enjoyable.",1
16,"im not a massive dc fan. being a big fan of marvel. so i probably enjoyed this more than a dc fan. sure it wont win an oscar. but its an enjoyable film to watch an everyone i went with enjoyed it, so ignore all the critics an just go watch it. an decide for your self",1
17,"The movie was fun. Acting was well executed. Especially mark strong as sinestro, it's not his fault the writers dropped the ball with his character. But the problems with his character could be fixed with a sequel. The rest was fine compared to the comics.",1
18,"I thought it was much better than what the critics thought,  I would recommend it.   I thought the special effects were good and tha Ryan Reynolds was excellent in his role.  Remember they had to spend time with the background of the story,",1
19,"My husband & I really enjoyed Green Lantern alot!!!  We thought Ryan Reynolds was great and the special effects were very good. We think the critics were way wrong - Green Lantern was so very much better than Thor the bore,  Hope they do a sequel wirh more romance between Reynolds & Lively",1
20,"The movie was really entertaining.  Critics got this wrong.  Yes, the movie was a little short and a bit rushed.  It should have been 15 minutes longer.  However, aside from that, the special effects were pretty good and the origin story was pretty close to the comic.  I hope they still make a sequel with Sinestro as the villian.",1
23,i think some of the criticism was very harsh indeed. Ok it is no masterpiece but it's very entertaining and has decent humour. I think the problem was with the plot and the lack of real enemy. Also the whole idea that ou can create any weapon you like it's too easy and maybe not too interesting on the big screen. Regardless I would like to see a sequel.,1
24,"This movie is a lot better than what many critics are trying to make it out to be. I am a fan of the Green Lantern super-hero idea (and not just because my favorite color IS Green) but because of the fact that the powers of a Green Lantern is that while a chosen one wears the green ring, he and/or she and/or it can create virtually anything they can think up of in their mind. The character designs, C.G.I. and special effects were all amazing, and the actors/actresses' who made up this movie all played their parts to perfection! Comic book fanatics will be especially pleased, as this movie explores in great detail, the origin of one of the greatest Green Lanterns (some would even argue the BEST Green Lantern ever) known as Hal Jordan. If you want to see action, romance, and humor in a comic book superhero movie, than this is a great movie to see! :D And a sequel is definitely not out of the question, I recommend checking it out to see what I mean. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it! :idea: Enough said! ;)",1
25,"If you loved the comic book series, then you will totally get this film.  All others, just go find something else to watch.  The 3D version of this film was actually a worthwhile endeavor as opposed to being a distraction like so many other movies with the word 3D tacked onto them.  Not destined to take in as much as most Marvel efforts, this DC Comics movie still does the Green Lantern mythos proud.  I'd rate this as a strong contender for your matinee dollars and a reserved recommendation for your evening greenbacks.  Enjoy and let darkness fear your might.",1
26,"Green Lantern is so much better than so many other films that have been released recently I expected schlock from all of the negative reviews but I found it to be fun, visually engaging, and the characters interesting,and likeable.  This is NOT A BAD MOVIE.  It is not perfect but it doesn't insult your intelligence and isn't ultra violent like most.  I seriously don't understand the bad reviews it didn't deserve it.  This was way better than Transformers- all of them. Also better than the Jar Jar Binks Star Wars atrocities.",1
28,"Thoroughly enjoyable movie and shouldn't that be what movies are!  Great action scenes, not enough main bad guy for my liking.... and not enough Sinistro either! Roll on Green Lantern 2...",1
29,I liked it. Adventure with a side of humour. Ryan Reynolds was great.  Clancy Brown is a great voice for Parallax. Peter Sarsgaard is a great villain (Hector Hammond) . I'll probably see it again!,1
30,"I really don't get all the negativity. This was a fun movie that introduced me to the Green Lantern universe. Did I have complaints? Yes. First of all, the actress playing Carol was horrible. Second, while not completely terrible, the pacing definitely needed some work. But these complaints are only minor compared to the fun I had watching this movie.",1
31,"I liked this movie for what it was, a superhero movie. It won't win academy awards but it was fun to watch. Just make sure it's what your looking for before you see it.",1
32,"What can I say, I'm a sucker for comic book movies. If you're going into this expecting ""one of the most brilliant films of our time"", you might want to just go get your money back, but if you're looking for an eye-popping, action-packed, good time, then you picked the right movie. You may not enjoy this film as much as I did, unless you're like me and grew up on the Green Lantern comics and cartoons, but I do think you will enjoy Martin Campbell's marvelous take on the world of the Lanterns, and the Lanterns themselves.",1
33,"Half way thru the movie I was completely bored and didn't really care much whats gonna happen next, besides that main characters were presenting zero chemistry, only reason that made me stay all the way till the end was group of friends.",0
34,"Disappointing. While the cast does a generally good job with what they are given, and the visual effects are pretty good, the dialogue is poorly written, the pacing sometimes suffers, and the movie tries to do too much in too short of time.",1
35,"Books often don't translate well to film. A good writer can make it work. The acting in the film is fair, but no actor can transform a bad script into a good film. Those who chose the script should be hit with the bill for failed sales at the box office. Their opinion of the public verges on contempt and therefore the public shows its contempt by ignoring this trite effort at cinema.",1
36,"I was surprised how good this film was. First, you have the ""professional critics"" saying that it's a bust and then, the users? I walked into the theater expecting Fantastic Four! It was legitimately well done and brilliantly written! The weak points were the score (I couldn't hum a single line from the film if you asked me to right now. It's very forgettable.), one line delivered by Hal's friend (""But doesn't the hero always get the girl?"" The audience just sat there, confused. It was completely out of context and made NO sense.), and the apathy the audience is supposed to feel for the Dr. He may have wanted the girl, but I'm not sure I believed that. Also, his dead was a little underwhelming. The movie gets very ""real"" in a couple of parts...and they are both believable. Reynolds has always been a phenomenal actor, but he really shines here. These people tearing the film apart were in a bad mood. They had to be. Of course...these are the same people who told me Thor was a good film. Ha. You will enjoy it. I can almost guarantee it.",1
37,"As someone who has been reading comic books since I was 12, I have to say that GL was great. After watching Superman Returns and the last three X-men movies I had almost given up hope that any superhero screenplay would be anywhere close to the source material (Superman having a son? Jean Grey killing Cyclops? blasphemy!) GL, and the Dark Knight before it, renewed hope that Hollywood can make a comic movie without completely rewriting 50 years of character development. Other than the presence of Paralax, 90% of the Hal Jordan origin story reflects what you find in GL: Secret Origin (by Geoff Johns), which keeps this from becoming just another cringe worthy attempt to cash in on the wave of superhero films since the late 90's. That being said it isn't Shakespeare, so if you're looking for a heady drama you're not going to find it here. Overall it was a great summer adventure that keeps you entertained for an hour and a half, which is just what it is supposed to do. The Pros - True to the source material- Ryan Reynolds plays Hal like he is supposed to be: flawed, but working to overcome his shortcomings- Amazing character design for the other GLs (Sinestro, Killowog, Tomar)- Enough (but not too much) humor to prevent it from being dark and dreary. GL isn't Batman, and isn't supposed to be.- Didn't feel like it was overloaded with visual fx, but they still looked awesome- Good dialog overall. no ""are you an angel"" (to quote phantom menace) lines in this to make you wonder what the writer's IQ isThe Cons - needed a bit more action, if they make a sequel they should find a villain who's main ability isn't that he's a ""thinker not a doer""- not enough character development for the supporting cast. other than Carol the average audience wont really be able to tell you anything about Tom, Killowog, Tomar, etc. and if you haven't read the comics you really won't know why Hals older brother is an assbottom line: not a bad job for GL's first time on the silver screen. I'd give it an 8.5 if they'd let me",1
38,"Yeah critics shame on you. I really liked this movie. Critic's are fools and trolls and shouldn't be trusted. Make up your own mind and support a good movie. I mean i thought Thor was awesome, but i still think Green Lantern deserves way more credit. I saw no problems with the plot at all other than changes that they made from the comics which is always expected from Hollywood. Ryan Reynolds acting was good had a good story and he wasn't annoying like as Deadpool in Xmen.",1
39,There is a fine line between a good movie and a great one â,1
40,"Green lantern was a wonderful comic book movie come to life after all these years. it was brilliant & bold to use the cgi effects to give an Epic action sequence, including the costumes. Hectors mutated head was very realistic, and Parallax even more deadlier  than the comics.  This is an all entertaining movie for everyone.",1
41,"I may be one of a select few people, but I don't listen to reviewers to decide what I watch. In fact I HAD to create an account just so I could further prove why I'm glad I don't. Everywhere the critics have it voted worse then I have ever seen a movie rated. Yes it had some minor flaws, but I still don't believe it deserved HALF of the brash words it received.Let me start off by saying that I am an AVID green lantern fan, in fact I was going into this movie EXPECTING to be disappointed. Just because I felt that it could never convey what I believed the Lantern Universe deserved on the big screen.I was still looking forward to it, even with my negative expectations.I truly believe from the bottom of my 'comic book guy' level of 'fan-dom' that it could not have portrayed Hal Jordan and the lantern Universe any better.Yes, There were some issues with the plot, and I truly thought that the Hector Hammond story arc, could have been saved for a later movie. I also felt that there were things that did NOT stick to the comics but overall it was close enough to stay ballpark accurate for the fans and coherent enough for the newcomers.Now, while I did think there were minor flaws, the one flaw that bothers me most is everyone keeps comparing it to something IT IS NOT.It is not The Dark Knight, it is not Iron Man, nor is it by any means trying to be either one of them.While I love them both the problem with those movies is the dark and sombre tone to them, and the lack of connection to the characters themselves. Think about it, Batman can only do what he does because he is a billionaire, same with Stark. While that is a nice setting, Green Lantern does away with that altogether and basically says: ""No."" No you can not join us, no matter how smart you are, no matter how rich you are, you have to be CHOSEN.There is absolutly nothing else like it, maybe that is why the critics hate it, they don't really know how to review it.In today's dark, gritty, and all around perverted style of comic book movies, Green Lantern actually does us a favor and tries to be different.Instead of gritty caves, murderers and terrorists it gives us a place we can escape from the human concerns and tragedies that surround us.Every scene that had both Hal as a lantern, as well as the other members of the corps left me wanting more. Every scene where he was just plain ol' Hal gave me more insight to what was going on in his head, and yes the script was corney at times, but it was SUPPOSED TO BE! That is actually Hal's character. The part of Sinestro was amasing as well, often times I forgot he was an actor.People now-a-days complaining about 'Obvious CG' need to remember one bloody thing.""The original Star Wars/Star Trek movies/series USED MODELS ON STRINGS!""WHO CARES?! Frankly I didn't notice anything obsurd about the CG, nor did it ever feel out of place. In fact I felt that it was the most stunning CG I have EVER seen. When we were on OA it felt how OA should feel, magestic yet completly alien. When we saw the other lanterns it was the same.I am finished with this review but I leave you with one final and important thought.I went to see this movie with my fiancÃ©e and my best friend.Neither of them had an understanding of the comics yet, when all three of us walked out of that theater after the credits had finished rolling and the screen turned off.We all asked the same question:""When is the next showing?""",1
42,"I saw this movie (in 3D) with two friends of mine... et we loved it ! I say there are a few flaws in the script, but it's not that important. And... It's what ""I"" wanted to see in the fist place. Great action, great fun !!! I can't wait to see what they will with Sinestro in the second movie... LOVED the whole thing ! G-R-E-A-T !P.-S. This movie make me want to join... the Grenn Lantern Corp. LOL. :-)",1
43,"How there can be such huge fans of Harry Putter and say this movie wasn't great is beyond me.  Funny, action pact, awesome special effects, great message that wasn't environmental.  Great movie for the whole family.  Thank goodness for finally a great comic book movie since Iron Man 1!!",1
44,"This movie is trying to make it a better DC comic book film that brings the awesome The Dark Knight and Superman, but I'll admit that this movie is more less than the other superhero films that doesn't get hype that too much. Green Lantern is okay and decent, but this movie is a lot of fun to see in summer and we can see it in 2D instead of wearing in 3D. The background is pretty awesome to look at, the action is so cool, the effects are pretty damn good (I love it when the Green Lantern is using his powers to fight with cool techniques that transform into anything), the cast is okay, and the story was a bit strange, but it works for a comic book movie.",1
45,I actually really enjoyed Green Lantern and I might have to put that down to that I love comic book movies or the surprise of liking it even after reading bad reviews. I had no knowledge of Green Lantern history going in so maybe it helped coming in fresh. I was really impressed by the 3D and SFX. The fact that the lanterns can create anything just by thinking about it is so kick arse cool. Hal Jordan (a surprisingly good Ryan Reynolds) is likeable and I stuck with him.Now thats not to say that there are not bad points. Its all so predictable and the two enimies are really cheesy. To even think that this came from the same studio that gave us the truely epic Batman movies that are so in a different league. Think taking a Ferrari (Dark Knight) out for a spin on a racetrack and then a Lada (Green Lantern). The Ferrari you will always remember but hairing around in a Lada would be fun when it lasted.  If you just want a good popcorn Friday night and some light hearted fun this is worth seeing.,1
46,"I honestly have no idea what the reviews are talking about, Green Lantern was amazing!I loved every thing about it. The fights were awesome, Oa looked fantastic, Hector was creepy as hell, Ryan was wonderful, the CGI was great, the pacing was near-perfect and the jokes were spot on! Sure it wasn't 100% faithful to the comics, but what movie is? GL was very fun and exciting. And all of this is coming from a big GL fan.I went in expected to be disappointed, but I came out with a huge smile on my face. I can't wait to go see it again!",1
48,"This movie won't make you think however it has a solid story and solid acting. If you are a fan of the comic book this is a must see, for the general public overall its not a bad movie.",1
49,"Fact: Green Lantern has a history spanning over four decades and DC tried to cram a lot of it into a 2 hour flick. Is it any wonder then that the content seems a bit rushed or compressed? I think not, yet consider it a foundation movie. Okay, many DC Hal Jordan fans will probably not appreciate some of Hal's ring constructs. Hal never used complicated machinery like mini-guns or Anti Aircraft guns, but at least they kept to the more contemporary treatment of overcoming fear rather than the original fearless concept, definitely more believable! The more missing bits for me were more the camaraderie of the Corps, they have always been something like the Musketeers, all for one and one for all. Still they did come save Hal from burning up in the sun, too little too late for me personally. If you are not a rigid fan of the comics you can appreciate the struggles of the Hal Jordan that suddenly and very unexpectedly is handed over such power. You can even root for him as an underdog against the somewhat condescending alien species who look down on the young emotional humans. But they got one thing right, though often doubting, Hal never gives up and fights for his friends, the world, and yes also the universe. Sinestro, Kilowog, Tomar Re, and Abin Sur were well portrayed and most comic book fans would appreciate that but have wanted to see more. The final scene was classic Sinestro and well positions the sequel in what could become a great franchise if they don't try to cover so much in the next movie. 53 million the opening weekend may make the sequel a reality and if so they need to have a stronger plot, more Corps camaraderie and more character interaction between Corp members that somehow manage to unite in purpose despite such diversity.",1
50,This movie does not deserve the critic reviews that it has received so far.  It almost seems that the reviews are paid by Marvel studios!  Special effects were excellent!  The 3D was arguably the best executed since Avatar. Even Thor looked fuzzy and out of focus compared to this movie.  The story could have been better and the pacing was off and that means this movie will not win an oscar but i never tried to.  This movie is meant to be family fun while managing to give GL fans many of the things we wanted to see. This movie does not bastardize the concept or the story that was developed over so many years in print. I give this movie a 10 to make a point. It does not deserve a 10 not does it deserve the current critic score of  39. IMDB has it right.  These ratings just go to reduce my trust in  metacritic and rottentomatoes reviews.  Go and Enjoy the film.,1
51,"Everyone sounds so stupid on this page.  ""OMG Why would anyone like this movie?  They should've seen *insert less successful movie here* instead!""  Its summer, its a comic book superhero movie, it had  a bazillion dollar budget just for advertising... you're right that pretty much adds up to ""lame movie"" however, they aren't even attempting to make genre changing, Oscar winning gold, they are trying to sell some tickets to a movie that costs a **** to produce.  Its fun, its entertaining, and the changes made from the comic book were necessary for time constraints.  If you have read the Green Lantern run that has been written by Geoff Johns the past few years this movie would satisfy your craving to see these epic space battles in live-action rather than on the page or in a usually bland reinterpretation on animated DVD.  This movie is easily one of the most entertaining superhero movies made and it sticks to the spirit of the book more than most superheroes even try to pretend they do.  Loved it.",1
52,"Don't believe the haters.  If you like superhero movies, you will like Green Lantern.  If you don't like superhero movies, then you won't like Green Latern.  It's a good movie....maybe not GREAT....but a good movie.",1
53,Bursting onto the screen with a winning combination of action and dazzling effects DC Comicsâ,1
54,Excellent movie... and 3D made it all the better. It was the best 3D effects I've ever seen. I really hope there will be a sequel. The end of the movie (after the credits) left room for one.,1
55,"Seeing the boyish image of Ryan as Hal Jordan was the major influence not to see the light of the lantern. However, even though Ryan brings to life Kyle Rayner, in my opinion, Green means a must go in my book! I'm more into the way a movie conveys a message. Especially in a comic book movie, we want to know how to be the hero of the day. Have some courage and check this movie out!",1
56,"Yeah!  DC rules!  Or so I said at  the end of the movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  What a welcome respite from the loathsomely puerile likes of ""Thor"" and ""X-Men: First Class"".  Was it high art?  Hell no.  Was it great fun.  Hell yes.  I might even see it again, and I don't often do that.",1
57,"Its good to see dc going in the same direction as marvel, this movie is what its supposed to be fun..a good popcorn flick worth seeing and worth buying when it comes out..",1
58,"Don't believe the critics. This film is a lot of fun! Its got great action fun locations and a list of great characters as long as my arm. Going to a comic book film should be a fun experience at all times, it should be light and fun. This is that movie! Its only rival would be X-Men: First Class which is another great comic movie. Green Lantern starts off with some great adventure and will keep you entertained until the end. The special effects are a lot of fun to look at, and the 3D conversion looks fantastic. Its a must see for comic fans and fans of fun summer movies, because when it comes to summer movies this is head and shoulders above the rest!",1
59,A very good movie for a first run at this particular hero! R.R was the right choice. A good balance of action both in the suit and out. I look forward to number two!,1
60,"I am pleasantly surprised, after reading numerous critical reviews that trashed this film, to walk out of it feeling as if it was a pretty good way to spend about 2 hours of my life. This film isn't going to win any groundbreaking Oscars, such as Best Movie, but it sure did entertain me and left me with a pretty good feeling. Sure, there were some moments that felt off but all-in-all, a solid collection of performances and some intriguing special effects kept this film from falling into the ""Worst Super Hero Movie"" category. It had a whimsical charm to it and there was a decent amount of tension as well. Ryan Reynolds did a fantastic job with the role he was given and Blake Lively did not disappoint as his love interest, mainly because she was not the damsel-in-distress type... well, sort of. The other world was cool but most of the fun stuff happens on Earth. Actually, this film kind of reminded me of Thor in how the different worlds are presented (theirs more colorful compared to our earthy pallet). Its villain (Peter Sarsgaard) was a little underused which is a shame because his performance was quite creepy. Angela Basset was good but criminally underused while tim Robins was snarky and suave. The script could have used some tweaking as that was perhaps the weakest link in the film but it wasn't horrid enough for me to think ""this is total crap"". It kept me entertained. In this regard, Green Lantern did its job.",1
61,"It does a disservice to contentious comic fans, moviegoers and the Green Lantern brand itself.  It attempted to do far too much with far too little time.  Three different tangential story-lines that never really flesh themselves out, action sequences that are all-too few and far too short, and a horribly cliched by-the-numbers comic book movie script ('Eh, slap it together, we'll get some CGI to cover-up all the inadequacies').  All due to far, FAR too many Blake-Lively-dramatic-pause-faces.  Put it on a t-shirt, you know you love that phrase.   The most disheartening thing for me is that it probably won't inspire people to pick up any of the canon of Green Lantern comics, an infinitely more enjoyable and rewarding experience.",0
62,"If u r a complete bore with no friends or sense of humor DON'T go see this movie as no one wants to read your post crying like a baby about how ""Your"" version of the movie wasn't met! This flick was an awesome roller coaster ride that was never a dull moment and had some of the most gorgeous visuals of late. I love all the comic book movies that have come out and this one has made me a fan of the Green Lantern. Go support the studios!",1
63,"After all the critic reviews I thought the movie would really suck but I found myself thoroughly entertained.  The plot is not the strongest ever, but the visuals are amazing and the movie was fun. Go in with a light attitude and you will probably enjoy it.",1
64,"Definitely worth watching if you're a fan of Green Lantern, but they tried way to hard to cram as much Green Lantern fan service as possible. The whole sequence with Kilowog and Sinestro training Hal prove this. Kilowog shows up, calls him a Poozer, punches him in the face, then leaves. Sinestro calls him weak, humiliates him, then leaves. They should've either went all the way with the training, or had it in the next movie. The actual plot was pretty straight forward. Nothing fancy, but it worked.",1
65,"I was expecting an absolutely terrible, painfully cheesy comic book movie, and I ended up genuinely enjoying it.  What makes this movie is the visuals - if you have any interest in incredible 3D and special effects work, then you will definitely get your money's worth.  However, be warned that every single romantic scene, as well as a handful of others, are PAINFULLY CHEESY.  Let the cheese do its thing, let the visuals blow your mind, and I bet you'll enjoy it too.",1
66,"I was looking forward to this moving for a long time, then I started seeing the critic reviews rolling in and my balloon began to burst and I was not sure if I was even going to spend my money to see it. Obviously I did, and mainly because critics, the majority of them, suck. They are too full of themselves to enjoy a good movie. This movie was fun. It was a great superhero flick, and I am glad I went to see it. There was no bad acting, nothing to speak of takes you out of the fiction of the movie. Go see it in 3D if you can.",1
67,"I'm an admitted comic book fan, but not a rabid Green Lantern fan, and I fully understand that some liberties have to be taken in order to translate a comic character into a live-action movie.  Still, I found myself utterly disappointed with the mess that was Green Lantern.  While the movie did stick reasonably close to the comic book lore, it didn't do it in a way that drew me in and kept me on the edge of my seat.  At times, Ryan Reynolds just seemed bored and like he was reciting his lines.  Parallax was more dull than scary, Hector Hammond was not nearly as creepy of a villain as he could have been, and the buildup to Sinestro's turn to the dark side seemed more like an afterthought than a logical progression for the character.  Sadly, this just movie just ended up being another in a line of disappointing movies starting DC Comics characters.",0
68,"I've never really been a Green Lantern fan, so I wasn't expecting much...and there wasn't. The film just seemed boring and nothing likable except a couple of scenes.",0
69,"I don't think the story is interesting , so the movie is about blah blah blah you suddenly gain power and oh **** your only a human and you cant fight god damn aliens than suddenly big scary final boss which looked like very powerful and strong and than the big scary strong boss is killed under 10 **** MINUTES. This god damn movie spent too much time on talking about love and boring things....Boring!You know what the 2 score for? It's for the air fight at the beginning which is quite nice for me.",0
71,"There are plenty of bad movies been released this year, but i will draw my attention to the biggest disapointment of the year. Green lantern looked AMAZING in the trailer and it really does portray an epic tale of good vs evil , Will vs Fear. Me being an avid green lantern fan and a follower of DC comics i was looking forward to DC's 3rd major movie release other than batman and superman. With the huge depth of super heroes from DC unvierse to make movies on i thought that this movie would be one of the best movies out there this year. Oh how wrong was I. Even for me a true fan of the GL, this movie is utter rubbish. Its really boring, takes forever to get going and when it does it ends. It feels more like a setup for a second movie (at the end you will see why) but given how much it has flopped unless they know the 2nd movie will be a million times better than this, no one would go near it with a barge pole. The acting is okay in my opinon, Ryan Reynolds does a good job as the GL but his supporting cast look like they couldnt care less. The Special effects are good when you get to see some action but its not enough. If you are not gonna have action scenes then at least replace them with an engaging story, Unfortnately it dosent, stay away from this title its very, very poor.",0
72,"As I've said many times before, it's all about expectations. I didn't expect a ton from the movie, especially after many of the critics panned it, so I was pleasantly surprised by it. No, it's not high art - it's a comic book movie. But I felt more emotionally engaged in than I did with Thor and many other films of this genre. Reynolds is solid, and the relationship between him and his scientist ""nemesis"" is much more tangible and human than many comic book conflicts. There are sympathetic feelings going both ways before things get perverted. What's more, while it's a little cheesy, the will vs. fear conflict is very Romantic. The physical manifestation of the human feelings is something that Nathaniel Hawthorne likely would have found interesting. I enjoyed it. Blake Lively wasn't as bad as many in my theater would argue, but there wasn't enough chemistry between her and Reynolds. Yes, they are exes and mere colleagues now; However, there is more heat between cop partners on TV procedurals than there is here. So for me, it's better than Thor, Spider-man, the new Superman, and the Hulks, but not as good as either new Batman film - though that's a high bar.",1
74,"Going into this movie with an extensive knowledge of Green Lantern comics history and characters, and having followed previews and reviews of the film, I had been quite concerned. Initial trailers and previews had looked uniformly uninspiring at best.  Also, the choices of Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively for the film were areas of some concern to many fans of the original comic source material, who doubted whether either performer would be capable of projecting the level of depth and gravity that appeals to modern comic fans familiar with the revised and modernized source material largely created by the film's Co-Producer, Geoff Johns. Finally seeing the film in 3D at my local theater, I was pleased to see that many of my concerns were either unfounded or overwrought. Reynolds and Lively both delivered adequate performances, though at times both suffered from a bad case of ""I'm reading my script now, and it says to say this line with emotion!""-itis. The film's computer generated graphics were largely competent, with a few stop-motion style artifacts in some scenes that were likely exaggerated by the 3D process.   As fans had actually suspected from early in the process, Mark Strong's performance as Corps member Sinestro was a particularly bright spot in a film that needed them.  On the other end of the spectrum, Peter Saarsgard does his best to channel John Malkovich, turning in a performance just so over-the-top as to fit in right at home in a movie based on comic books. Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell whether the problem with Saarsgard's Hector Hammond is with his portrayal, or the writing his character endures. Angela Bassett turns in an excellent performance as Amanda Waller, who seems to be given a far smaller role than the history and depth of her character's comic incarnation but almost seems to be there in order to offer a way to tie in further characters and background with other possible sequels or connected films.Fans of the comics will have a whole host of characters and story elements to find in the backdrop and scenery, particularly on the Guardian planet Oa. Newcomers to the Green Lantern mythos might feel somewhat overwhelmed at those moments, but fortunately the filmmakers seem to sense that as a possible problem and move the story, and action, forward without much delay. Fundamentally, Green Lantern provides through pacing and a solid if largely genre traditional script, what could have been derailed by a few small but easily spotted flaws of the variety critics seem to love to hate.  For a comic movie to have a script with so few plotholes is quite praiseworthy, but it does fall victim to a problem more often seen in sequels where one villain would likely suffice but two are offered instead.In all, Green Lantern presents itself as a fun, well-paced story with a few flaws in the production that either result from a relatively short production schedule or moments where it appears scenes may have been cut to reduce the running time.  The pacing and action sequences make it a good popcorn flick, and one that will probably spawn an entertaining Blu-Ray release with added scenes and special features.",1
75,"What were the critics thinking? I loved this movie. I liked the story, acting, special effects, I really loved this movie. I went to see Super 8 last week and didn't think it was near as good as this movie. It was just like the comics that I grew up reading. All I can say is if you read the Green Lantern back in the 70ies like I did, then you are going to love this movie. The guy playing Senestro looked just like him! Don't listen to those stupid critics, go see this movie.",1
77,"This movie is a horrid, wretched, and miserable experience. The movie is full of superhero movie cliches, it contains a bland writing, Ryan Renolds (an overall decent actor) looked totally oblivious to what was going on in this movie, the supporting cast, with the exception of Sinestro, is basically nonessential to everything going on, the special effects range from average to outdated, and the production as a whole is sloppy. The movie acts as if it doesn't care so why should we?",0
79,"Wat a pile of crud.  And now the studio wants to give us a sequel!  the trailer was good, but that was the only thing that was.  Honestly wanted y money back.",1
80,"No one was anticipating this movie like I was - I've been a GL fan for forever. It was a complete and epic letdown.  Though it looked very much like everything I had ever envisioned a GL movie to be, it never elicited any emotion from me other than embarrassment for the squandered actors delivering some of the worst dialogue imaginable. But that dialogue is extremely forgivable however, considering the genre.  Flash Gordon has some of the worst dialogue in movie history, and it is head and shoulders above, in terms of forgiveness. It's the complete lack of any solid action that damns this adaptation to a place where some of the worst of comics-to-movies go to die.  I thought at the very least, Martin Campbell would take me to the edge of my seat with action sequences like he did with Bond. I was lulled to genuine boredom by them.  The only thing this movie managed to do was dull some of the pain away from my previously-huge disappointing memories of The Phantom Menace and G.I. Joe.",0
81,"Don't expect this to be a movie that actually moves you or makes you think, like fellow DC comic book blockbuster The Dark Knight. Instead, bring a bag to barf in when the words fear and/or willpower are mentioned three hundred times in a blurred montage of vague green colors, poorly written dialogue, and Ryan Reynolds' ass. Go with friends for a cheap laugh.",0
84,"The Guardians! The Parallax! Ryan Reynolds lost Scarlett Johannson for this mess! I certainly hope Ryan cashed a hefty paycheck and was, in fact, fooling around with Blake Lively. Blake, by the way, is the best part of this movie. Ryan also has another problem. He has a baby face and a feminine voice, definitely not super hero material. The special effects are fine but if you have a choice (I didn't at my theater) skip the 3D, it's not worth the extra 3 bucks. The plot is disjointed and really bad even by super hero standards where we tolerate a lot. Some decent actors (e.g. Peter Sarsgarrd and Tim Robbins) also give lackluster performances and I am still trying to figure out why the Dr. Hector/Senator Hammond subplot was even inserted into this movie. The age old adage ""If you buy the premise, you buy the bit"" just doesn't work here and half way through this movie I was looking at my watch trying to figure out when the 105 minute running time would let me out of this cinematic mistake. Save your money and cross your fingers that Captain America does a better job with the super hero genre.",0

87,"Being a lapsed GL fan, and a forgiver of much (I even found merit in the Electra movie) I went into this with my mind open. Sadly it would take a professional safe cracker to open it enough to allow for the fact that this utter, complete, total, rancid and appalling thing cost between 200 and 300 million to make. I suspect that money was spent mainly on pushing this on the masses and what was left was split between Ryan Reynold's fee, fizzy drinks and sweeties for the 5 writers. My brain actually boggles that this was passed by WB as something they could put out.",0
88,"Comparing this movie to other superhero movies its BAD. Bad Dialogue, just bad. Good scenery though i'll give them credit for that. This movie is so bad I can't even write a bad review. Read another bad review and that is how I feel lol.",0
90,"This was not a well conceived film.  So much has already been said about how this that I'm not going to pile more on.  Instead I'm writing this as a request to future superhero filmmakers.  Please try a little harder to take into consideration the age of the mythology.  Green Lantern has been around since 1940.  That's a full 70 years before anyone thought to put the story on film.  That means that if his first fans are still alive, they're in their 80's.  Have a little more respect for people's memories.  Spend some time on the writing, put aside the egos and let the writers who have talent and are fans of the subject weave the reasons for that love into the story.  There are thousands of superhero stories out there and most of them are rightfully forgotten, so the few that stand the test of time have something that has been speaking to people for generations.  Find that truth and make it the foundation of every thing the story communicates.  And THEN make it look really cool.  Also, yes there is subtext, but these are also comics not Shakespeare, so you don't have to bury that too deep.  Story first, then merchandising opportunities or whatever else the suits are making you squeeze into it.  This film was clearly made for junior high kids, and that's about money, we get it.  But throw us 30, 40, 50, and 60 year olds a bone.  We want to be transported too.",0
91,"This is a great example of a non-Nolan DC film, it stinks and its quite horrid. Superman Returns also joins this list. So therefore, the High Council of Film should pass legislation that Christopher Nolan should do all the films for DC Comics, even as a producer, because he'd still have power over the film. These are just my comments, but below is the review.It nearly induced me into a deep sleep. I don't know why. Oh I know! It was very bland, it had a weak, formulaic script, overacting (yes, Ryan Reynolds growls like Batman on one part), convulted direction, and some very crappy CGI. I didn't watch this in 3D, but I was probably smart not to.Pretty much, this was a terrible movie that was rushed and just was released at the wrong time. I say, they should have put more emphasis on the script than the CGI.It was pretty funny though how Tim Robbins' character looked almost like Glenn Beck.",0
92,This movie was trash. The fact that the actors in the movie are big names they still messed it up. The movie was worse then Batman and robin or Spiderman 3.  IMO. A trash movie. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.,0
95,"Ryan Reynolds has officially ruined his career with this movie.  Until this point, he'd been a great comedy actor with some crossovers into drama & action.  The only movies of the comic-book inspired superhero genre worth seeing, in my opinion, are the revived Batman series of movies.  Even those are getting a bit campy with Bale's overly-dramatic angry whisper-delivered dialogue.  Hollywood needs new creative minds badly.",0
99,I'm a big fan of the superhero movie genre. I grew up on comic books. I don't expect movies to directly channel the comic books; there has to be some allowances for the different medium. I thought Daredevil and X3 were decent movie fare.Green Lantern is easily one of the worst big-budget superhero movies I've seen. The story was boring. The pacing was boring. The dialogue was boring. The chemistry between Reynolds and his female romantic lead? Boring. The villain was boring. The Corps was so amateurish that a noobie like Hal Jordan easily shows them up in the boss fight.This is a terrible movie.,0
103,"I can't agree more with DaleHeisch. Those who hate it, don't understand the genre. The makers of GL made this one for the fans. As a comic book fan myself, I enjoyed the subtle visual homages to the comic art style employed throughout the movie by the photography direction. I don't want to spoil anything, for those who have the keener eye but there is one shot in particular that I found fantastic. The Green Lantern story is all about Hal and so it is in the movie. I found the movie to be a lot of fun and terrific to watch in 3D.",1
109,"People liked the Star Trek film because it wasn't a Star Trek film, it was an action film based on Star Trek. People hated the Green Lantern film because it was a Green Lantern film, not an action film based on Green Lantern. If you like plot, mythos, and cool concepts, you'll like this movie. If you came just too see things hit with a big green hammer, you'll be sorely disappointed.",1

113,"Don't listen to the critics. They were probably expecting another ""Batman Begins"", were disappointed because they instead got something more kid-friendly, and overreacted about. Well, except for Armond White, who thinks Green Lantern, X-Men: First Class, and Thor are racist. Green Lantern and Thor are NOT racist, and I haven't seen First Class, but I'm 100% sure it's not racist either. Okay, back on topic. This film is entertaining, fun, and refreshing. It did feel rushed at times, although not as much as Spider-Man 3, and out of the two, Green Lantern is the better one. I was disappointed in Parallax, who looked fake. Green Lantern's CGI mask still looked very fake. As itsjustsomerandomguy's Magneto said...... are they gonna be done with that thing before the blu-ray comes out. Well, everyone should be glad it wasn't as fake as the shark in ""Jaws: The Revenge"".Like Thor and Captain America, Green Lantern stayed true to the comics. If any of you wonder why Sinestro was Hal's mentor rather than his nemesis, it's because that was the case in the comics. So frankly, X-Men: First Class, from the looks of the trailer, looks like it's the only superhero movie of the summer that didn't stay very true to the comics. But anyway, Mark Strong did his role better than anyone else. Ryan Reynolds did his role well, too, but not as good as Mark Strong. Same with the rest of the cast. Like I said, don't skip this movie because the critics hated it. In my opinion, this movie is a lot of fun, and go see it and then have your own opinion about the movie.",1
116,"I'm a huge fan of green lantern and this movie certainly didn't disappoint me at all. It had great 3-D, ryan reynolds was perfect for the part. The guardian's of the universe looked great and there was some amazing action. It was kinda weird that yellow wasn't a weakness but whatever.",1
118,"Fun superhero movie, very true to the original comic book and great (corny but cool) comic book stories of its heyday.

Performances are good!  Dialog could have used a little spruce but it served.",1
120,"There have been some awesome super hero movies that have come out, and Green Lantern has earned the right to call itself one of them, Ryan Reynolds does a fantastic job, as does the rest of the cast, I would have liked to see more interaction between Hal and the rest of the Lanterns, but that's a small complaint, and it does have some other minor flaws but in the end that doesn't detract from what is one of the best super hero movies of this year.",1
122,Basically this is a movie about a guy who finds a ring and saves the world. That story dates back to like 1930 when comics first came out. This movie is filled with cheesy special effects and dated story. I was very surprised to find this movie was a total bomb. This movie is just terrible and I didn't like it at all.,0
125,"I wonder why i still want to watch this movie. maybe it's just too infamous. for me reynolds still can fit to physical qualification of Jordan. And yes, i like the likeness of Sinestro. But everything else....it just...can be thrown out of the movie. The story...doesn't not engaging at all. All the corps doing nothing just making lamp through the space...just Hal...even Hal action sequences also feels boring and inconsistent. some of the battle he's weak, but he beat Parallax himself. Poor Hal, poor Sinestro, they deserve better.",0
128,"There are movies willed to life by the passion of their creators, and there are movies like Green Lantern, which are willed to life strictly by market forces. Superhero movies are popular right now, no one had tackled Green Lantern yet, and voilà, here’s an adaptation that only the mouse-clicking digital artisans behind the effects shots seemed to give a **** about. Beyond the undigested lump of information about the origins and purpose of the Green Lantern Corps and a new rogue force threatening the universe, the early scenes are a marvel of CGI landscaping, presenting deep space as a shimmering Technicolor arena that pops like the pages of a particularly arresting comic book. Then the film comes down to Earth, repurposes Top Gun as a superhero story, and goes through the motions with a kid-friendly arbitrariness not seen since the last Fantastic Four movie. Returning to the Van Wilder unctuousness that he lately had successfully dialed back, Ryan Reynolds plays Hal Jordan, a hotshot fighter pilot who rides into the danger zone at every opportunity. He also ignores the rules of engagement, has more raw talent than anyone has ever seen, is haunted by his pilot father’s tragic legacy, falls for his superior (Blake Lively) on the tarmac, and would likely serenade ladies with “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling” if Anthony Edwards were his wingman. Hal’s raw talent (and ripped abs) are not lost on the galactic forces behind the Green Lantern Corps, a brotherhood of warriors that maintain peace in the universe. As a new enemy called Parallax threatens the balance, Hal comes into possession of a ring that gives him the power to fight back with the force of his will and imagination. Green Lantern tries to make a case of human exceptionalism: Out of the thousand-plus species comprising the Green Lantern Corps, only Hal, the newcomer, has the humanity that can save the universe. But a message like that is hard to believe in a film so utterly lacking in conviction, it needs a 25-year-old Tom Cruise vehicle just to keep its spine straight. Peter Sarsgaard seems to be enjoying himself as a nerdy shut-in turned evil scientist, but Green Lantern otherwise goes through the motions, even when it has the chance to deploy any digital weapon its hero can imagine. In staging an interstellar battle of will vs. fear, all it can offer is a shrug.",0
129,"The DC Comics have always been populated by many characters of different abilities... but the two most popular characters are, and always have been, Batman and Superman. Not to mention that we have had many variations of movies with Batman and Superman... maybe it's because they're easier to translate well onto the big screen, more so than most other heroes. The character of Green Lantern also proves to be a challenge to adapt into a feature-length film... and it seems that, in 2011, that challenge has not been attempted well. Ryan Reynolds stars as Hal Jordan, a hotshot test pilot for the Ferris Aircraft Company. Reynolds seems to channel mostly what Chris Evans did as Johnny Storm in 'Fantastic Four' (2005), often disregarding the health and safety of himself, and always breaking rules when he sees fit. His limitations come from Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), who always has to tell him to take better care of himself or else he will end up either hurt or dead. She is also the daughter of Carl Ferris (Jay O. Sanders) who is the aircraft designer for the company named after him. Hal ends up discovering something along his travels... he finds a green ring that has chosen him, for some reason, and sees a crash where a dying alien-like species named Abin Sur (Temeura Morrison) informs Hal that the ring chose him, and must use it to protect and save the race. It seems that things get out of hand when Sur's body is taken to Dr. Hector Hammond (a hilariously awful Peter Sarsgaard), and the life of the alien species is drawn onto Hammond, leaving him to change in appearance and become hungry for power. Hal trains to become the powerful ""Green Lantern"" through a series of training montages, executed in such a cliche fashion, that it is not funny... it is in fact, very excruciating to watch and sit through. Luckily, these training sequences don't last long... but at the same time, they don't give us, as the audience, time to develop with Hal as he becomes used to the powers and abilities. The ring is able to create whatever it is Hal is thinking. He uses it to save anyone from danger, but this leads to a string of badly rendered CGI action scenes that look more animated than a Pixar movie. 'Green Lantern' is a 2002 superhero movie, disguised as a 2011 superhero movie... it uses all of the long-dead cliches and traits that you expect from a typical superhero origin movie... a nobody finds something and becomes a somebody. He must train to become this somebody, and meanwhile, an antagonist finds himself poisoned and deformed in appearance and just wants power... for some reason. He also kills people as a threat to get what he wants. The hero's main love interest is kidnapped and he must make a decision that will secure everyone from danger. If you've seen virtually any superhero movie over the past decade... then you have definitely seen 'Green Lantern'. It's hard to believe that director Martin Campbell, who directed the brilliant 'Goldeneye' (1995) and 'Casino Royale' (2006), would go on to make a superhero movie lacing depth, compelling characters and a series of well-crafted action sequences. Plus, I must mention how awful Peter Sarsgaard's performance was as Dr. Hammond... the constant screaming, and bad CGI to deform his appearance is unintentionally hilarious to watch, and drags the movie further down than it should.",0

OK, I'm not a fan of Green Lantern (he is probably overrated), but how come they still going to make a sequel if it was #1? Are the filmmakers making a second chance opportunity at greatness against Batman and Superman movies? The answer is NO. Nobody even critics wants a Green Lantern sequel because of Ryan Reynolds slow but awkward performance. Green Lantern was another mediocrity in 3-D movies so far and a mild one. I hate Green Lantern and it is one of the worst movies of 2011.",0
148,"Certains m'avaient critiquÃ© du fait que je donnais mon avis (pÃ©joratif) sur le film Ã  partir de la premiÃ¨re bande-annonce, qu'il fallait que j'attende le rendu final. Et je dois bien avouer qu'ils avaient raison : Green Lantern est bien pire de ce Ã  quoi je m'attendais. Avec un humour qui tombe toujours Ã  plat, un rendu visuel trop poussÃ© Ã  en Ãªtre moche Ã  regarder et des acteurs pitoyables, s'ajoutent un manque de punch incroyable (la puissance d'un pouvoir sans limite n'est vraiment pas prÃ©sente) et tout un tas de clichÃ©s incroyables des films du genre. En somme, Green Lantern ne rÃ©volutionne pas les films de super-hÃ©ros, mais il a le culot de se montrer Ã  la hauteur alors qu'il ne l'est pas. Batman peut dormir sur ses deux pointes.",0
149,"In brightest day, in blackest night, no crappy movies shall escape my sight. Let brain-dead hacks who cannot write, beware this critic... (referring to Green Lantern) IT'S NO DARK KNIGHT! No indeed. Green Lantern is far, far away from The Dark Knight.",0
150,"In this film you can say that the plot is awful and has serious shortcomings ... some parts are nice, but not appreciable. We say that the work would have been better. The Italian dubbing, because I come from 'Italy is very poor compared to the Italian tradition of dubbing would say that is bad in comparison. As soon as I saw him I was not happy ...",0
151,"It's a good movie. It's got action, sci-fi, a beautiful woman, a charming male actor, a super hero... The movie's problems lie on its dialogues; and on its obviousness. But it's definitely not a Elektra. It's more like a Hulk 2.",1
152,"I should say i am an Marvel fan rather than DC Comics but nonetheless this movie was good and definitely worth to be watched. I was not so familiar with Green Lantern before this one and didn't read any comic books of him.Ryan Reynolds did fine and was fit for the role, Just like the time he played Deadpool in X-Men movies. Blake Lively was hot & stunning as we all expected.  The boss fight with Parallax in city was actually looking like Kraken scene in Clash of the Titans but all the space fighting and brawl near the sun was exciting. Wish i could be watching this in 3-D.",1
154,"Is incredible how in a movie that lasting 2 hours, nothing happens, this movie is boring and lifeless, 2 villains and both didnÂ´t scare you or make you feel danger, one super hero that is more busy flirting with a girl than actually saving the world, and even worst a nonsense story",0
155,"Based on the DC comic character of the same name, Martin Campbellâ",0
156,"I can sum it up in a word ""Disappointing"".  The entire start to the movie, from the badly v.o back story, to the whole fighter pilot scenes, set the movie up really badly. There was no substance, nothing clever, and overall just anti-climactic.  Each year, comic book heroes are coming to life nd getting better and better, but unfortunately this one missed the mark entirely.",0
157,If Blake Lively is the person that has to be saved all the time then there isn't much saving involved in the film. But with all the superhero films I have watched in my life it is definitely up there.,1
159,"This movie was OK! It wasn't great, but it was just ok.The first scene, where you see his father die, was terrible. I mean, come on! This is an action movie, not a drama/sad movie. The movie was way too focused on Hal Jordan's earth and his life, and not the outer space (which is the meaning of the movie). We wanna see how he defeats the giant monster step by step, and not only one hit!It takes way to fast for Hal to defeat the monster, haven't you realized that? And the monster is so ugly and slow and just.... boring. I'm sure tons of you guys are thinking ""Ah, I can make such a better movie, If i was the director i would have made a masterpiece.""- Jason",1
162,Not as bad as everyone is saying. Some of the CGI is very very questionable but besides that the story of the Hal Jordan is told fairly well. I like d the action sequences and how the power of the ring was explained and used.,1
163,"A great performance by Ryan Reynolds and it was really fun he played a test pilot who becomes a superhero with will as his main power i think this was a great movie, the greatest superhero movie i have ever seen.",1
166,Hollywood have done it again!This movie felt rushed from beginning to end. Plot wholes everywere and as a comic book nerd i felt raped after watching this movie. Did they even READ the comics? This is just as bad as AVP & AVP:R.This movie had a BIG budget and where did all the money go?  If you are a comic book fan and like marvel/dc movies i advice you NOT to spend money for this pile of shi*. Go and watch Captain America or even Ben Afflecks DareDevil.,0
170,"This movie is corn-al-icious, and was painful to watch. It was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Do not watch this, it is terrible, and you could probably AVP more.",0
171,"It's not NEARLY as bad as most critics claim it to be. The action was quite good, but from a comic fan's perspective, there really wasn't that much of a focus on the world of the Green Lantern Corp. It's a very Hal Jordan focused origin story. I also did not like the female lead actor's acting. Not the perfect movie, but it was worth an afternoon and 10 bucks.",1
172,"Pretty good movie but it seemed short. I loved the dialog and action, but it just seemed to go by really quick and was surprised how fast the final battle happened.",1
175,"Green Lantern is laughable because the hero is neither charismatic nor heroic he is just this human being with a lot of special effects on him. The special effects are awful and the acting is terrible. This a severe disappointment. I give this movie 16%. I say this is the worse superhero movie, ever!",0
178,"I had never heard of the Green Lantern before The Big Bang Theory but now I know why. This film is awful and the whole idea of the character and the universe from which it derives is awful. I know the filmmakers clearly didn't come up with the character's powers but how did this comic ever become successful? The film itself was below par, Ryan Reynolds did his best but no one else can really say they did anything positive in this film (or at least anything of note). Do not watch this film.",0
179,"Ok, there are better superhero movies, but ""Green Lantern"" is still enjoyable (I would give it a 6, but it's been bad reviewed enough). Ryan Reynolds is a good actor, he really looks like the comic-character Hal Jordan and also the rest of the cast has made a good job. Not a masterpiece, but still worth watching it!",1
180,"A guilty pleasure. This was the most disappointing comic book movie I ever saw at the movies, that and Spiderman 3. How could they do this to Green Lantern? They have a superhero who travels into space all the time and is practically Star Wars material. WHAT DO THEY DO?!?!?!?! MAKE A MEDIOCRE MOVIE OUT OF AN AWESOME CHARACTER!!!! .... What did you expect? For it to be good? This movie is a so-bad-it's-good movie. I was hoping for a ""Dark Knight in space"" epic, but what we got was an over-produced, poorly written and terribly acted piece of $200 million dollars that went straight down the box office toilet. What a shame. Now the guilty pleasures of this movie: Well this is Green Lantern's motion-picture debut, just not a great one. Some of the scenes are entertaining but HEctor Hammond is so bloody annoying you want to staple his mouth shut for the rest of the movie. His screaming is unbelievably annoying. It's like listening to a podcast of a baby crying 24/7 and never stopping once. So pointless. As for the plot, the whole thing is a mess and it messes with Green Lantern's mythological background quite a bit. Parallax was never an entity trapped in the ring. Instead he was a corrupted Guardian who wanted to use the power for himself. Hell, if that wasn't enough, the imagination that Hal uses for the ring is just as limited as the writer's abilities to write awkward dialogue let alone stronger plot and character development. Thankfully we got The Dark Knight Rises from Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment so we can forgive them for Green Lantern.",0
181,"It's not treacherous, but it's laughable, and it doesn't intend to be.",0
182,"Green Lantern is a decent movie that could have been better but is still a decent movie. Plot: Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) has a great relationship with his father Martin Jordan who is a pilot. When he watches his father fail a takeoff he also witnessess his father die from the jet's explosion. When he grows up he is judged by many for being extremely **** and rebellious which is a form of courage. Meanwhile a Green Lantern, Abin Sur part of the Green Lantern Corps; an army of different specied aliens who have sworn to protect the world with courage converted into energy by rings which possess the green essence of willpower, has failed to re imprison the guardian of the yellow esscence of hate, Parallax. As a last hope he escapes to Earth where Jordan stumbles upon him and inherits his ring. After a series of events Jordan is a trainee in the Green Lantern Corps and swears to use the green essence of willpower as a means of preserving peace. My opinion: If your interested in Green Lantern I would watch this movie, if not this movie is still good at delivering the origin story but compared to other super hero movies does not compete.",1
183,This film is awful. I was really looking forward to watching It and I was really disappointed. The film is slow paced and the fight scenes were abysmal. A film I do not recommend at all.,0
185,Bad movie in general. The story line was dumb and bad acting. I dont mean to offend any comic book movie lovers but this was the worst comic book movie Ive seen in a long time. And what kind of a mask only covers you eyes???,0
189,why would anyone think that this is a good movie idea is beyond me  even so the Execution is ridiculous  how can someone is Exposed to something that can travel him anywhere in the universe never act surprised  like it was happening to him his entire life  this movie don't make any sense in the slightest.,0
190,"Of all the second-rate comic book movies that has occupied most of 2011's summer, ""Green Lantern"" is the only one of its crowd without a saving grace. ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" saw a true hero in Steve Rogers, giving as much attention to his human character as with his superhuman attributes. It was the goofy playfulness of ""Thor"" that made its overall silliness acceptable. ""X-Men: First Class"" was a prequel that founded itself on prior knowledge, instead of avoiding it. ""Green Lantern"" doesn't have a singular thing that could make it more than what we already expect. It fulfills the requisites of the superhero genre, then immediately stops trying. Millions of years ago, long before the nuisance of 3-D, an assembly of aliens called the Guardians formed an intergalactic peace-keeping organization. Each member, called a Green Lantern, was assigned to protect one of the 3,600 sectors of the universe. We're not sure how many planets or galaxies each sector covers, but we trust the judgment of the Guardians. With the whole universe accounted for, the blue, big headed Guardians have decided to spend the rest of their immortal lives in a planet called Oa. This peace is interrupted when a colossal, evil force named Parallax figured that it would be real evil if he started to eat planets; Earth and Oa are on his menu. Meanwhile, on Earth, our central human characters who coincidentally all have daddy issues, are introduced. Hal Jordan is a reckless test pilot whose actions on the job are always questioned by his authorities. When a severely injured Green Lantern crash lands on our planet, Hal is the one chosen by the Lantern's ring as his replacement. His duty later lands him in Oa, where he meets the Guardians. Plot details are discussed, obvious questions are asked, and shallow dilemmas are regarded with undeserved seriousness as a delay for the obligatory climactic confrontation, like taking 90 minutes to get to a destination 60 minutes away. Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/green-lantern-movie-review/",0
191,"When launched the Green Lantern thought would be a cool movie, but it was not, for me it became a rich experience weak and exploited. Not worth it to have spent money for nothing in a disposable product.",0
192,In an era of the comic book movie this is one of the worst.  A lot of pointless story telling mixed with an unimportant villain and some mediocre acting makes you hope they just cancel any sequel plans.,0
195,"Reviews were mixed for Green Lantern although all the trailers I viewed indicated that it would be a movie that I would thoroughly enjoy. And I was right. From beginning to end Green Lantern is a special effects extravaganza and an entertaining origin story. I generally do not care for origin stories because being familiar with a superhero character means I already know the story and would rather see something new. With Green Lantern we really have the best of both worlds. The movie does not delay in placing the ring of power on the finger of Hal Jordan. From there we watch as Hal struggles to meet the burden placed upon him while the Earth is threatened by Parallax one of the Guardians of Oa that has turned evil. There is good character development with Hal who is depicted as being a womanizing  and brash pilot to a responsible superhero. The CGI is top notch and the depiction of Oa, the guardians and many of the other aliens that are a part of the intergalactic Green Lantern Corps rivals the special effects seen in the more recent Star Wars prequels. The relationship between Hal and Dr. Hector Hammond, who is infected with the yellow power of Parallax, could have been better fleshed out and brought to more depth. The same could be said with Hal's relationship with Carol Farris. There seems to be little justification for the affection between the two given the characterization of their earlier antagonism toward one another. Parallax has a habit of easily defeating the other Green Lanterns in the Corps and after the Guardians of Oa refuse to help him, with the encouragement of Sinestro a future supervillian, Hal faces the Corps most notorious villain alone. I won't give away the ending and although origin stories can be predictable, as this one certainly is, the story is told in a manner which is exciting and entertaining. I am unabashedly a CGI junkie and this movie delivers on that account. Therefore combined with a story that is pretty riveting despite its predictability along with great eye candy The Green Lantern is a good introduction for this underdog and little known superhero.",1
196,"There have been better superhero movies, MUCH better. But this is still a good superhero film that'll make the comic faithful excited and happy. I liked this movie, there's just something missing, but I really do think this movie was good.",1
197,"Going into this movie, I didn't expect much. But what I watched was a disaster! Probably the worst super hero movie made!? The story was typical, the cgi was awful! I felt like I was watching cut scenes from PS2 game, the movie felt rushed. Avoid!",0
198,"Although  people have been heavily criticizing this film for its lack of quality and it seeming rushed, both of which I agree with, they had something in there which could have developed into a much better movie. It was entertaining, on the whole, and I found it managed to keep me interested for a long time. I'd like to think myself as a DC geek, and I found myself impressed at how well they'd managed to keep to the original stories.I think the critics are complaining primarily because it couldn't get anywhere close to the Dark Knight, which is a very hard act to follow for DC. Anyone remember Batman Begins? It was good, but nothing special, however it led on to one of the greatest films ever made, in most people's opinion. I think that if Warner Bros. wade through all of the bad reception and decide that they will continue on this, they will be able to produce a far better movie for the sequel. Ignore the critics. Rent it if you can and see what you think.",0
203,"This movie is so bad I don't even know where to begin. It has bad acting from everyone in this film. Its almost like the director said ""act like you were on a school play, but worse"". Second, the graphics were awful. They even put in a CG mask. Who does that? Third, the script was garbage. It folowed no real plot, which just went from bad to worse. Easily the worst superhero movie of all time.",0
204,"The trailer made this film actually look like a summer blockbuster to watch out for, the problem was the casting, acting, writing, editing... pretty much the entire film despite the spectacular effects. Mark Strong was the shining light through this storm of terrible.",0
211,Sadly this movie had a really bland plot and dialogue with a boring villain. Another big problem with this movie is there was way too much CGI. Well I can understand everything that is made by the Green Lanterns but did Hal's costume and Sinestro have to be CGI? Overall this movie was a mess.,0
212,"If the dark knight is how a superhero movie should be done, this is how it should not be done. Everything the Dark knight did, is reversed here. Really if you've seen a poster for this movie, you have experienced about as much character development as there is during the film. The special effects, actually, are woeful which is a real problem for a film solely reliant on special effects. Overall really, this is the worst superhero movie to be released so far, and really it would take a pretty monstrous effort to undo that.",0
215,The biggest crime with Green Lantern is the utter disrespect of the source materiel. Apparently DC executives have begun filming themselves taking a crap and expect it to make money.,0
219,"It's a bizarre thing - by all rights this movie should be complete rubbish, but somehow it manages to be quite a lot more. it has its share of cheese, but overall this is a fairly solid super hero movie with a reasonably decent script, with a few decent laughs I might add, story and characters as well as a ample dose of interesting comic book lore. The action is well done with some fairly epic set pieces. I can't understand why it got so panned, as super hero movies go, it's certainly one of the better ones! Let's face it there's been some real turkeys, and this ain't one of them!",1
225,"Personally,I think this film gets way more hate than it deserves. Ryan Reynolds does a pretty good job as Hal Jordan and I actually didn't hate the CGI suit. One of my favorite characters was easily the character Sinestro. My main complaints were the villains, Hector Hammond & Parallax. But in the end, this is a very enjoyable film.",1
226,"I'm being generous and giving Green Lantern a 7 because, unlike many other films, including many superhero films, I watched this film without pausing to check my watch and do a quick calculation of how much movie I still have left to sit through.It's not the greatest film ever made.  There's at least one major plot point that defies all logic, such as why the ultimate evil villain needs any henchmen at all, since he's already proven himself capable of defeating some of the most powerful good guys in the entire universe.  But Green Lantern does one thing that many other movies fail to do:  it kept me entertained.It doesn't dawdle.  The fights do not go on so long that I start falling asleep.  The dialog is competent and manages to avoid a lot of trite buzzwords.Now I'm not familiar with the Green Lantern comic mythos, so maybe this film plays better for me just because most of it seems brand new.  Unfortunately, I've got no way to judge that and all I can say is give this film a try.",1
227,I have to say that this is very overrated. One of the worst film I've ever seen. I don't want to talk about anything. It's the worst.,0
228,"Deadpool Said it Best""Don't Make The Suit Green Or Animated!"", As Well As A **** Script, Bad CGI, Ect",0
229,"A very good movie, well acted, well done. Of course for cinematic needs everything has been put togheter a little bit fast, but still respecting the story.",1
230,"It's a good movie. It's one of those movie that, for some reason, has some bad reputation and bad press but I cant' understand why. It narrates the birth of Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) and introduce the viewers to sci-fi and aliens aspects of DC universe, introducings of course the Emotional Spectrum Powers and various rings colors.In this time it can look a little simpler and with less budget than modern superheroes flicks but it does his work properly.Try it, I've fount it on Netflix in HD and special fx are all aged well (Aliens, Suits, Green-ligth Constructs and so on).",1
232,Do not watch this movie! save your soul. It was soo bad that I was laughing soo hard during the Deadpool 2 end credit scene,0
233,"The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Back to the Future, The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight. These movies changed cinema forever for the better and set an example for movies to come. Green Lantern easily fits in this list as one of the most emotionally encapturing superhero films in the film industry. The critics AGAIN were paid off by Marvel. They are such shills. I mean, what real critic would accept money from a production company to give their movies good reviews? Pathetic. The critics mention how the visual effects are an eyesore. This is certainly untrue, as they do not understand true art. They have to be fair, as this movie was released in 2011, so the effects couldn't be as good (except the Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man 2, Captain America, Incredible Hulk, and any other Marvel film). Moving on, I am a true comic book fan. I read Batman: The Killing Joke Twice and TWO Green Lantern comics so I know what I'm talking about. The story is inspiring and has great characters. The main protagonist, Hal Jordan, is very annoying, which is very true to the 2 comics I have read because the Hal Jordan we all know and love is a cocky douche bag. To be honest, I haven't watched the film since 2012 so I don't know the characters that much, but I'm sure they were great and very accurate to the two comics I have read. Lastly, villains come and go in movies. Some good, like Joker, and some bad, like every Marvel villain in their bland franchises. Dr. Eggman, I mean, I mean Hector Hammond, is the greatest comic book villain ever projected in cinema (except the marvelous Steppenwolf, but I don't want to talk about my second favorite movie, Justice League). I don't remember him in the two Green Lantern comics I have read, but I'm sure it's very faithful to the other comics. Speaking of comics, I have read on Wikipedia that Sinestro is the main villain of Green Lantern and was seen in the end credits. Unfortunately, I was asleep and did not pay attention to the final 45 minutes of the movie. Though he wasn't featured in the two Green Lantern comics that I have read, I am sure he was a fantastic and MARVELOUS villain. Some MARVEL SHILLS agree that villains should be developed like their horrid Loki or Thanos, but they fail to recognize that this is a new era of character development. No longer do we NEED character development, this film has shown me that. Now, as a REAL and UNBIASED critic. I do have some MINOR complaints. The story is underwhelming and all over the place and the trailers made it look better than what it actually was, but it was a FUN movie. For a movie to be FUN it has to show that the production company did not take the movie seriously at all, like who gives a crap about a good story and characters, let alone a good ending. BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THESE MINOR DETAILS????? As long as I see punches thrown, that is a good movie to me (UNLESS IT IS MARVEL. THEY WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD AS DC AND MARVEL SHOULD STOP TRYING TO REPLICATE DC'S CRITICAL SUCCESS). All in all, I just want to say that I gave a fair and unbiased review for this CULTURALLY CHANGING AND IMPACTFUL FILM. Thank you,DCShill12",1
237,"Overall, Green Lantern was forgettable. I just finished watching and I can hardly remember it the film. The shallow story, weak acting, lack of action, and terrible CGI make this film seem longer than it actually is.",0
238,"UN film divertente e che ti porta nell'universo dei Lanterna Verde, l'attore mi e' piaciuto ed anche la storia l'ho trovata congrua con i fumetti.Forse dovevano spiegare meglio il potere dell'anello e far capire quanto sono importanti i Lanterna Verde nell'universo.",1
