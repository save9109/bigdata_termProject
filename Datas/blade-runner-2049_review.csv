0,Blade Runner 2049 is a beautifully crafted film and as good as any fan of the original could realistically expect it to be. I was nervous about what Villeneuve would come up with as I was not a fan of Arrival which I thought was far too ponderous. Fortunately he's delivered the goods and then some!,1
1,"A near perfect movie, and a sequel we never thought would be possible. It touches themes from the original with respect, while expanding the plot and adding to the world intelligently.The cinematography and music is also exceptional, often the music and picture works together to show us a hypnotic view of a grim future that seems too real. Denis Villeneuve is definitely one of the best directors of our time.",1
2,"There's certainly more style than substance on show in the new sequel, but the story is still engaging. At no point during the nearly three hours running time did I feel bored or frustrated with how the plot was moving along. There will obviously be negative comparisons with the original, but this film should taken on it's own merit, and great merit it has.",1
3,"I went in with low expectations and a feeling that I was going to come out disappointed. I'm thrilled to say that while not perfect, Blade Runner 2049 is in my opinion the best film of the year {so far} and unlikely to be topped. Worth the wait? You bet!",1
4,"While it doesn't raise thought-provoking questions as effectively as the original, ""Blade Runner 2049"" earns its position as a worthy sequel thanks to a captivating mystery, action that feels earned, intelligent themes & world building, and lush cinematography which synthesises perfectly with an unearthly soundtrack. Never felt bored throughout the runtime and could have watched it for longer.",1
5,"For those previously watched the first installment of Blade Runner or haven’t seen it, it’s safe to say that the latest installment of the Blade Runner franchise is easily one of the best sequels ever made PERIOD! Since this film is directed by the man who made jawdropping films like Prisoners, Sicario, and Arrival, his articulation of direction and storytelling really does capture the right atmosphere that Ridley Scott has set since the first Blade Runner. Most people that worked with Ridley Scott had already returned for another ride, but this time with Denis Villeneuve. The things that Denis had done for this installment really shines without a shadow interfering at a splitsecond while watching this. The new characters and familiar faces for this latest installment impressed me, futuristic-like production design, electrifying visual and sound effects, kickass performances, spine-chilling orgasmic soundtrack, and the god-like cinematography that Roger Deakins set really does spark a lot of amazement for the sequel. (Get Roger Deakins his OSCAR ASAP!!!!) However, there’s a thing that kind of caused a very little ruckus throughout the movie, but it doesn’t affect the movie’s quality that much since there will be another sequel readied for us to see what lies beneath the door (If confirmed...) Like Deckard said “I did your job one—I was good at it” it clearly refers that someone else besides Scott or Villeneuve will take control and finish the story (if confirmed..)  Without a doubt, Blade Runner 2049 is an outstanding achievement and a technical masterpiece that will be enjoyed by many sci-fi fans around the world.",1
6,"Creating a worthy sequel to one of the most influential films of all time is one hell of a tall order. It deserves no less than a dream team of talent and thankfully that's exactly what it got. The direction is sharp, the visuals pop, the performances emanate, and the writing is true to the source without merely aping all the old notes or ruining all the mystery. Core themes of the genre it helped create like the line between illusion and reality or defining humanity and one's identity are both upheld and explored in increasingly nuanced ways. Those worried about a neo noir film devolving into an action fest can breathe too as that was oversold by the marketing. The one trademark I do miss though is Vangelis' multilayered, ever present composition. 2049 strikes a different tone and isn't afraid of quiet moments, but the absence of one of its predecessor's most defining features remains conspicuous. Still, nearly everyone involved in the project is at the top of their game and should be proud of the work they've accomplished. Time will tell exactly how well the sequel stacks up to the 'original', but in any case it comes as close one could ask for today. I can still scarcely believe it, myself.",1
7,"An absolute feast for the eyes {and ears} and despite it's running time and pace, absorbing and captivating. Unlike Arrival which I thought was  very overrated and dare I say dull, Villeneuve has triumphed with this definitely worth the wait sequel.",1
12,"Bloated, portentous and worst of all, dumb posing as smart, for a Blade Runner obsessive like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is pretty much a worst-case outcome from the decision to “reboot”.​​It combines the ultra-slow pacing of a Russian art-house movie, with the implausible action sequences of a mainstream blockbuster. It has intellectual pretensions, but no real ideas, other than some half-baked biblical referencing. It takes a lazy, hand-waving approach to its plot and world-building. For me, that’s all unacceptable. If you decide to make the sequel to one of the most revered movies of all time, you need to get your quality bar pretty damn high. Blade Runner made its name by being genuinely intellectual, and having an insane level of attention to detail. This film fails to achieve either.There are plots holes you could fit the Tyrell Corporation's headquarters through. I can’t talk about those without spoiling, but lets just note that the core premise of the movie as spelled out in the opening crawl, the invention and legalisation of unquestioningly obedient replicants, is in direct contradiction to almost everything that follows, including the rationale for the mission the protagonist is sent on. The acting is fine, good even, BUT the actors are doing their best with horribly written characters who constantly make decisions that are absurd, often in order to set up action scenes that shouldn’t logically occur. Where the original revelled in moral ambiguity, we get a cartoonish boss villain who looks and talks like an evil-yoga instructor and appears to live in a health spa, and an even more cartoonish hot-lady-assassin henchwoman. In keeping with that Holywoodisation, all the women in the film are presented as lust objects, either evil or victims, and not in the knowing sense of exploited Zhora or Rachel, but as sadistic titillation.There are a bunch of scenes basically nicked from other movies, in particular Spike Jonze’s brilliant Her.Where the original asked genuinely profound philosophical questions about what it means to be human, this one has some quasi-religious guff about miracles and souls that jars badly with the paranoid, psychological Dickian source material and the post-religious bio-technological world that was presented in the first film.The world building is terrible.The world we are shown also doesn’t tie in with the mostly deserted, “kibble” strewn dying earth of the original. That was a place where almost all the able-bodied have left for the off-world colonies and the only remaining animals were manufactured. Despite some kind of second eco-disaster and a tech disaster both fleetingly referred to in the opening crawl (and in Matrix2esque short films on youtube), the world presented here is less dilapidated, more progressive, more organised, etc. than in the original. Fading art -deco has been replaced by Scandinavian design.The technology is all over the place. Again, that’s hard to talk about without getting into spoilers, but basically the film assumes that flawless AI’s and super functional “normal” robots/drones exist, and then doesn’t in any way address the ramifications of how those facts would impact the whole idea/purpose/issue of replicants, and how and why they are used, and how/why Blade Runners are used to track them down. I think that comes back to a recurring problem ideas being included because someone thought they were “cool” rather than being story/world driven.There are constant heavy handed and unconvincing analogies beween replicants, and real-world slavery and racism which the film then does nothing to explore.In some ways it’s a bit like the Force Awakens, another recent reboot that I hated. It’s a technically competent film that heavily references the original, in terms of props, characters and art style. It even features Harrison Ford. It has a plot driven by a series of improbable coincidences and chance discoveries that seems more like an excuse for “cool visuals” than a logical, character driven progression. But whereas the Force Awakens knew exactly what it wanted to be, going unashamedly for a nostalgia-fuelled, international, mass market audience, B2049 falls between stools.I feel a lot of people are going to disagree with my negativity on this one. There’s massive hype and hope around this movie, and it is mostly beautiful. Understandably, Blade Runner fans will want to like this movie. but going back to the Force Awakens comparison, after six months have passed, and people have moved through denial and anger stages, the sad reality of how average this film is will sink in.I went in to this one with mixed expectations. I loved Arrival, the director’s previous foray into SF, but on the other hand I thought that a reboot of Blade Runner was an inherently bad idea. For me, this one failed hard, both as a sequel and as general entertainment.",0
13,"This is visually exciting and a feast for the ears. Unfortunately every shot lingers on the screen for 3 or 4 times the length necessary to tell the story. And the story is hampered b y a lack of logic.  When the villain Wallace tells Ford he can take him off-world to torture him and get an answer he wants...he could do the same thing in the room he is in. And the big secret is obvious from early in the script.This needs a rewrite from a skilled screenwriter and then a serious editor to trim out the fat...by which I mean you could keep every shot cut to the length to make the next story point and the movie would be less than 100 minutes.The audience I saw it with was restless. There was no applause at the end, they just filed out in dispirited fashion.",0
14,"While the film wasn't terrible, it wasn't amazing either. The interactions between characters was superficial and their motives were as well. There was nothing profound like there was in the first Blade Runner. The scenery and sets were beautiful, as were some of the special effects, but a film can't be based solely on these things alone. It needed to have a villain, but it lacked this entirely. There was barely an iota of conflict during the film, it was simply void. We didn't know why the 'villains' were doing the things they did. The problem was again that these villains didn't have real motives. Nothing was believable, there was simply fabricated disdain and strife which didn't serve the purpose of creating a compelling story line. Also many of the scenes were too long, drawn out and weighed down with superfluous pause.",0
15,Movie seemed intent on putting moviegoer to sleep and then waking them with loud bangs. I would awaken to think I was watching some kind of cruelly beautiful Czechoslovakian arthouse film.,0
16,"Style over substance, pretentious emulation over valiant ambition. It's corious that this movie, in a sort of meta-narrative way, tries its best to be a replicant of the the original masterpiece but it totally fails to be what a replicant is to a human, a perfect alternative of the original. 163 minutes of Gosling boring looking expression while not a single thought is passing through his damn head, cliché insane villan with zero substance and his clichè nazi dog kicking asses around for reasons. Wrong photography all over: it's a **** noir with a white and orange palette, totally lacking the oppressive atmosphere of the original movie. Plot bad written and bad narrated, full of plot holes and incongruencies. This is not only a bad movie compared to the original, this is an atrocius sci fi movie to the level of 2017 GoTS.",0
17,"The new Bladerunner is so wrapped into symbolism, metaphors and themes that it forgets to make sense of it's world building, storytelling, character definition. Completely void of any inner logic, it falls short of even being a movie: it is indeed a magnificently crafted slow motion picture consisted of ingenious albeit often out of place designs and populated by a very talented crew of actors. Technically superb on a visual level, it is a gorgeous eye candy that gives you amp time to observe it's visual mastery and wonder why the heck couldn't they find someone to write for it, not that fanatic Ridley Scott that ruins Alien franchise with his last movies. The story is a series of most amazing coincidences that lead up to nothing at all, leaving you with deep questions like what do 12 hives of bees eat in a mad max fury road wasteland.",0
18,"Contrived story and Pretentious story telling. Over the top exposition that drones on and on to overly explain and give feeling of importance to an unimportant plot.  So the plot goes something like this;  Rachel and Deckard had a child. so the movie spends 2 hours trying to convince you its important somehow. CGI Rachel was the lowest point of the movie, with the villain suggesting that it was planned for Rachel & Deckard to meet in some sort of master plan.There are a handful of good scenes in this movie. Such as the opening scene, or in some of the visuals. But much of it is style over substance. The good pieces are far and few. And in between are just horribly long expository scenes where characters you dont care about talk about nothing at all. Nothing important or interesting happens throughout this entire movie. Just some stuff happens, some nice visuals thrown in, then it's over. I just wanted something to happen that I could care about. ANYTHING. go down in the streets. show what life is like down there. Let things happen on screen. Get me invested in a character or in the world. I just got so tired of boring people talking. Many of the sets are bland and uninspired. Bland white walls and bland white floors. or yellow walls and yellow floors. Don't bother if you enjoy the small details, because they aren't there. Many of the environments look sterile and lack the Blade Runner 1982 details. The Original movie wasnt like this at all. The environments were dirty, messy. unorganized, and lived in. You don't get that feeling at all in 2049. I get it that its supposed to be like 30 years later. But come on. This isnt meant to be **** star wars.The soundtrack was calm and sentimental at times, and then at other times very obnoxious and loud. I didn't enjoy the tone of this movie. The original soundtrack by Vangelis was beautiful. But this was like a dying cat at times. Also, dubstep. Really? What I would have liked to see in a new Blade Runner film would be a grounded movie about a Blade Runner who hunts replicants. We got that in the opening scene like an appetizer. But then the rest of the movie is just up in the clouds, trying hard to push its meaningless plot as interesting and meaningful when in actuality it isn't. Blade Runner 2049 is style over substance.My rating: Mediocre",0
19,"Blade Runner 2019 is the ultimate fan film. On that level it works incredibly well. It answers all the riddles posed on the first film  while offering new ones (possibly for another sequel). It also has incredible effects and cinematography that will probably net this an Oscar nomination.  Yet there lies its ultimate weakness: it is not an accessible film.  If you haven't seen the first one, forget about understanding this flick.  It is also bladder busting long at 2 hours and 45 minutes. It is a film that is budgeted for cinema, but can only be savored in home video (a bit like the original's 'faith'). This is why studios sometimes are reluctant to 'please the fans' too much.  At the end of the day, they are not enough to make back the film's enormous budget.",1
20,"True homage to the original. A great sequel. Truly refreshing. The ending tapered off and some characters should have been better developed for a trade of some of the other scenes. A must see, especially in 3-D.",1
21,"Blade Runner 2049 is a visually stunning movie.  It is the most beautiful movie I've seen since Interstellar.  That being said, I wasn't a fan of the pace of story and felt like it dragged on a bit.  Don't get me wrong, I think the story is good but the pace of it was too slow at some points.  Overall, I would give it a 8.1.",1
22,"I loved everything about this movie. This is the kind of movie that makes you travel to another world but at the same time treats of very concrete human topics. It is so rich, it's full of information and questions at the same time. It makes you travel both visually and mentally at the same time. During the whole movie you'll be wondering if it is science-fiction or anticipation? Some philosophical topics are treated without getting boring. What's the meaning of destiny or sense of purpose? What's the difference between man and machine if both are capable of having feelings and emotions? Denis Villeneuve, his crew and the cast just set new standards to what a masterpiece can be. Well done guys.",1
23,This movie was visually amazing. The sound in the theater was hard to sit through however.  I hope it was just the theaters sound system.,1
24,"A great sequel, with just one problem: 10-15 minutes too long.Beside that: awesome atmosphere, visuals, audio and storytelling.A simple story for complex characters.New classic together with the immortal first chapter.",1
25,"A good sequel to the original Blade Runner with excellent visuals - but is to long, the main villain is not that interesting and Deckard doesn't do much in the movie. Also music is better in original movie.",1
26,"It's visually stunning with a semi-easy plot to follow with some of the best performances you'll see from Gosling and Ford. This will go down as not only one of the best movies of 2017, but also one of the best sequels of all time.",1
27,"Director Denis Villeneuve continues his hot streak of stunning films with a sequel to one of cinema's - strike that - art's most influential pieces of expression. ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a mesmerizing plot-thickener with just enough intrigue to keep you hooked until the film's incredible final act. Let's not forget the unmistakably beautiful production design and cinematography, ultimately rendering this final product into what I believe to be 2017's best looking motion picture. A real wondrous feat that's left me salivating for whatever Villeneuve's got cooking up for next time.",1
28,"Like many of us I've seen the original Blade Runner movie countless of times (Director's Cut is, by the way, the only version I acknowledge) but I've also read late Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Unfortunately this movie isn't a masterpiece although director Villeneuve has left his mark to every frame. And those frames are beautiful!Blade Runner 2049 will receive Academy Award for best cinematography without a doubt. But it will not receive such honours for its screenplay.If you've read Dick's novel you may share my opinion which is that this movie totally dismisses its biggest catch, androids. Now we have an android Blade Runner which has a virtual girlfriend. We have also an blind oligarch who desires to spread his androids to the rest of the universe. We have a retired Blade Runner who's gone missing and at some point you'll have a deja vu regarding Harrison Ford if you have seen Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of The Crystal Skull. Heed my words!It takes a bit too long to build the athmosphere for the plot twist and we spend too much time inside this android Blade Runners apartment. His female supervisor is also quite useless and I felt she was in the movie only to emphasize how heartless android villain can be. But then again, android doesn't have a heart.Our protagonist does wonder if he's something more than a mere machine. However writers didn't had the courage to write a human character because there is a quite popular theory about Deckard being a android himself.In conclusion Blade Runner 2049 is a great movie but unfortunately doesn't beat the original. If you like Villeneuves earlier works you'll love it and if you love Ryan Gosling you'll probably watch it more than once.",1
29,"I have been waiting for this movie for a few decades it has the same vibe and open ended questions left by the first movie, and extended the first movies story in ways I never thought it would. I wish it did better at the box office I would love to see more chapters in this world.",1
30,"My greatest disappointment with this movie is that it probably wasn't good enough to make the old version's fanboys stop talking about that boring submediocre movie as if it was the greatest thing in sci-fi history. To me this is the only enjoyable one of the two, and a rewatchable collectible at that.",1
31,"I never had seen the first Blade Runner film in any of its versions, so when watching this film I was nervous that I would not understand certain parts that referenced it. Thankfully, the film does nods and respectfully grows from its previous entry and sparingly gives those references.The visuals and technology used in this is phenomenal and this makes it one of the most impressively shot and well constructed worlds and society I have seen in films for years. The technology is believable and the apocalyptic-like world Blade Runner presents is creative and yet relative to the viewer. The acting was pretty dam good with Ryan Gosling , Harrison Ford and a few other characters putting a really impressive display of emotions and realistic humanity to the scenes. The action is a bit low, but it serves to move the plot forward and can be somewhat unnerving to watch. If you were expecting constant action in a sci-fi noir film, you will be very disappointed.While I think the film was shot excellently, the cast did a great job on acting, I feel the story and certain scenes could have been better improved or toned down. The running length of the film has become a sort of like a joke for critics and they are not wrong as it is nearly two and half hours. Certain scenes could have been cut out and shorten a bit to propel the plot forward much more effectively. A couple head scratches came from me when certain plots were revealed and felt some moments were sort of cheesy to boot, so I would say that going in to see this film has to be under a certain mindset and test in patience. If you like constant action and ADHD style pacing, you will not enjoy this movie. Blade Runner 2049 is a well done film that successfully stands as its own sequel rather than a copy and paste of the original. Its world and visuals are award winning excellent, the casting was pretty good and only through excessive use of scenes and certain confusing areas do I feel the only cons for this film. If you like films and appreciate art, you are required to see this film. If you like a good detective movie, this is a recommendation. If you seen the original Blade Runner and not this yet, you should as soon as possible. This will not get everyone on board loving it, but those who appreciate its world and film as art will relish in this films for years to come.",1
32,"The Blade Runner sequel was an unexpected surprise, seeing how the original is now over 30 years old.  I have a love hate relationship for the original as it was a bit of a slow burn, but I respected it for its world building, unique cinematography and great ending.  That being said the sequel did a great job of building upon the already established mythos.	Blade Runner 2049 did not feel revolutionary to filmmaking, but was an overall very good Sci Fi film.  The acting was great, most notably the performances by Sylvia Hoeks and Jared Leto.  Both actors really stole the show for every scene they were in.  Some audiences  reviews stated the movie felt too long, but honestly the pacing felt fine to me. My only critique of the film is that it did not have the bizarre vibe of the original.   Gone were the mini clockwork replicants, crazy night clubs and claustrophobic streets.  This is less of a knock on the film and more of a nod to how much work went into making the original film.	Overall I recommend this film to any fan of Sci-Fi films or those who like the original 1982 film.",1
33,"Blade Runner 2049 is a slow and methodical film with plenty of interesting ideas and visuals, but it struggles through the second half. Ryan Gosling, Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, and even David Bautista are excellent. The opening act was a joy to watch as this cast effortless draws you back into the alienating world of future LA. Unfortunately, that strong beginning gives way to a meandering film that falls back on nostalgia for the original and struggles to forge a compelling new path. The villains feel superfluous and there are hints of a broader world that never really take shape. I wish I could rate this film more highly, but it just doesn't stick the landing.",1
34,"Has some pacing issues, especially near the end, but this was pretty good.  Nailed the atmosphere of the original, even though the story isn't a retelling but an entirely new direction.  Harrison Ford also put more effort into his performance as Rick Deckard here than he did as Han Solo in ""The Force Awakens"".  Still the ""old guy"" showing up to pass the torch of the brand he helped build to the next generation by being recast in the same role to give it more credibility (not that this movie needed him, but it certainly doesn't hurt), but he definitely put more juice into this role.  Maybe Han is a money thing to him and Deckard is more important - after all, Ford *did* want Han to be dead for good after the events in Star Wars: Episode 5.Jared Leto puts in an uncharacteristically calm performance here.  I would've liked to see his character get more development so he could have more screen time.Would love to get a modern point-and-click game in this new universe - the only downside to this idea is Westwood isn't around to do it proper justice, so maybe it's better if that doesn't happen!",1
35,"visually glorious, intense and dark; this direct sequel to 'Blade Runner' works as a futuristic journey with a mixture of nostalgia, but ultimately disappoints with a basic and repeated story - ""more a machine than a person""",1
36,"typical slightly prolonged movie w/ Gosling. you can easily not watch a 1982 film, if you look at the prologue. Gosling is a god. symbols symbols symbols xd.",1
37,"While it's hard to say any movie is perfect this movie sits at the very top of the pile for me when it comes to science fiction.  The artistry, direction, acting, writing, sound and music are all spot on.  It's a thought provoking science fiction rather than an action based thriller.  If that's something you enjoy then this is an amazing film.  One that I hope will set the bar for films to come despite not bringing in much at the box office.",1
38,"Unbelievably brilliant. As a sequel, it builds on the universe and characters created decades ago, but creates something new. Absolutely breathtaking visually, orgasmic score, great sound, superb acting and directing. Villeneuve deserves an Oscar for this.",1
39,"Blade runner 2049 is beautiful and breathtaking. The characters are all well acting. The world is stunning and believable. This is not a action movie, is a normal story. That will make you think of it after you walk out of the theater. I didn't give this movie a higher score is because the slow paste and some plot that they didn't explain. Hope they make a third movie.",1
40,"Enthralling,mesmerizing,visually stunning,masterpiece and a future classic are the words that suitably describe Blade Runner 2049Blade runner 2049 is an exquisitely crafted sequel which stands shoulder to shoulder with its predecessor,Blade runner,one of the greatest movies ever made.The neo-noir setting with an unwavering sense of impending doom amplifies the eeriness and adds dimensions to the film.The plot is solid , rich with characters and minor details all building up to an intense climax.Ryan Gosling , Harrison Ford, Ana De Armas, Jared Leto, Sylvia Hoeks act masterfully in their respective roles .Ryan Gosling plays the role of the lead perfectly .The characters are well built and rounded .Much is left to be desired out of Jared Leto’s character who feels kind of left out in the movie plot but is sure to play a major role in future sequels ,if any are made.The direction and cinematography is where the movie hits a homerun.Denis Villeneuve has created a mindblowing, sci-fi masterpiece no doubt.He is hands-down one of the best directors in the industry at the moment.Villeneuve has done a great job by skillfully integrating suspense and tension with the core of the movie plot.Roger Deakins does an amazing job as the cinematographer .The cinematography is one of the best I have ever seen in a movie.Every shot tells a story ,represents a theme chaos,beauty,love,fear,tension,insecurity etc.The production design and quality is top notch.The cinemascore and sound effects are amazing.The plot pacing is where the movie dips and could be turn off for some moviegoers.The movie is long,plain long(163 minutes) and the pace is slow.Not all moments are part of the main movie plot ,but introduced for possible movie sequelsFinal Verdict:Blade runner 2049 is a plot driven,intense,lengthy and a mindblowing sci-fi movie not less than a piece of art.If you love this kind of cinema this movie is for you.If your movie preference is the cars blowing,fights-breaking,explosion occurring every 15-min Michael Bay movie then this is not for you as you would lose all patience by the time movie reaches its climax.Score: 9/10: Translates to “Must Watch”",1
41,+Excellent visual style+Memorable soundscape+Fantastic cast+Superior existentialist plot+Welcome addition to the 'blade-runner-verse'-Be warned dystopic themes and 3 hour running time awaits!As a huge fan of the final cut blu ray I was blown away by how this film bested my expectations. Worthy of the hype and in a lot of ways felt it could pass as a delightfully dystopic 3 hour black mirror/twighlight zone episode.,1
42,"Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel that measures equally to its predecessor, a masterpiece in its own right. However, it seems much like the original, that Blade Runner 2049 will not meet its status as an iconic sci-fi film for some years to come. This is a visual masterpiece, depicting the most beautiful ruin of a city that has graced a film. From beginning to end in its 2h 44min run-time, it captivates the wonder of a decrepit dystopian world, all of which is shot beautifully by the incomparable Roger Deakins. The cast led by Ryan Gosling who plays ""K"" and Harrison Ford who returns as ""Rick Deckard"", act superbly to create an awe-inspiring film on the big screen. Under the direction of Denis Villeneuve, Blade Runner 2049 shows that he is one of the most talented directors and one of the few masters of storytelling in the movie business today.",1
43,A decent film. The directing is on point and the settings are quite as good as the original blade runner. The problem is the plot. Especially in the last third of the movie. Still a good film thanks to Gosling acting and Vileneuve directing.,1
44,"The P.H. Metric 78.75/100During my showing 7 people walked out, and there was only probably 15 of us, and they made it no more 50 minutes in. Several people I went to the theater with fell asleep, yet critically applauded and here comes the divide. Movies critics love, film does not make money even when they have huge investment and movies critics don’t love film makes enough money to fund 5-15 more movies. So in short this film is a disservice, because ultimately fewer studios are willing to take the risk on artsy films and all this film needed was to tighten up its pacing and it would have probably broken even and in terms of cinematic vision that is hardly selling your soul.Directing:  8.75/10The directing is superb and I am shocked with the level of investment that Villeneuve was given as much control as he was. Though it must be said that this film draws out shots for too long and this is from a man who loved the film Stalker. Where as something like Stalker is completely about the philosophical nature this film still tries to make it self an action/thriller/mystery film and these long takes end up killing the mystery and feels more like there is not enough story to go around, which ultimately is true. The shots themselves are lovely.Acting: 7/10Ford is Ford the man is not that great of an actor and he really is just cashing in on old franchises at this point. Gosling’s muted touch was decent enough and while Leto’s weird character was weird in a good way the character itself was unneeded. The main villain of the piece was over the top and worthy of being in a film that is trying so hard to be nuanced. She ends up coming off as a jarring screeching noise.Cinematography: 10/10Deakins’s cinematography shines, absolutely shines and this has to be his year. 13 noms and with Lubezki currently attached to a special award Oscar his major comp for the year is not there.Editing 8.5/10I feel bad for Joe Walker he kept the ship as tight as he could throughout, but ultimately due to the nature of these long drawn out takes that it feels like he was ultimately overruled when it came to where to cut the film.Score/sound effects: 5.5/10I would have scored this higher if I had not seen Arrival, where as the industrial style sound design should have been more engaging I could not help feeling they were reusing it from Arrival. Of course the sounds were meant to be jarring given all the silence we were fed, but ultimately it feels like that opening sequence in the remake of Funny Games, it is not shocking or jarring in the sense the creator wants, but more in the sense please turn down the TV those noises are starting to give me a headache.Visual Effects: 9/10I get a sense of Silent Hill (the first game) it feels like the fog and dust in certain scenes is there to hide rather than enhance and when one goes back to the original Blade Runner these modern effects (specifically shots of the city) do not look like the technology has really pushed the boundaries, in fact it looks more like the status quo, which mind you the status quo is excellent, but not genre defining.Writing: 3/10I am sad to find out there was a writer for this film. Now I previously mentioned Stalker which is similar in many regards, however the dialogue in that is profound, where is the dialogue in Blade Runner 2049 thinks it is. With such cliche android film lines as basically sacrificing yourself is the way to prove you are human. This concept never sits well with me, as apparently for an android the most human thing is to sacrifice yourself so that the human may continue to live a better life than you. That sounds like the kind of thing an android would be programmed to do. Asimov anybody? Everything just keeps pushing the fact that these androids want to be human, but ultimately it keeps slapping them down and saying they are not. It adds nothing to the greater debate over AI and ultimately when compared to the sheer quality of everything else in the film it looks out of place and useless, as if someone was brought in last minute to patch it up. Secondly the whole it could be him story was let out of the back to early on, so it made the double twist so predictable that it steals any power it had.Production Design: 9.5/10Those in production design you all need more respect and deserve to be pushed further into the foreground, because when you do an excellent job no one says anything, only look how well this and that is, but you owned this film.Costume Design 9/10Well done, especially Leto’s character, though I will say the only real negative was Wright’s outfit. What is this 2049 and she is channeling the 50’s or was she literally a copy of the police chief from Futurama. Also Ford’s was a little meh.Make-up/Hairstyle 8.5/10Again Leto is the high point, but not much else as everything is high quality, but nothing feels astounding.",1
45,"Most sequels can not keep up to their high expectations. Blade Runner 2049 does.i was satisfied with story, visuals and pacing. Not boring at all.",1
46,"The original Blade Runner was my first introduction to metaphysical philosophy. It was one of most profound and beautiful movies of the 20th century and it still affects me to this day..When I saw Ryan Gosling cast in the 2049 I was very disappointed. I swore to myself never to attend a movie of his again after the disgusting abomination that is ""Only God Forgives"" but I relented eventually, Blade Runner is that important.. He is the weakest part of the movie for me. I just don't like his voice or face. Thats personal preference.And what is the movie? A continuation of the transhumanist question from Blade Runner 1. Can replicants ( or even AI's who receive very positive treatment here) have souls? Can man be a God and create life? My anwswer is no and the movie answers in the affirmative, understandably. Judge for yourself.Symbolism and esotericism saturate every scene. Every line of dialogue, prop, stance, quirk, image,prominent and obscured has an obvious meaning ...and  hidden one...It feels religious in its exposition because in a way it is. Its arcane and occultist. It makes one think and want to return for closer inspection. Whatever your philosophical position there can be no denying the beauty visually and aurally of this devastated dystopia. Gosling apart, a masterpiece..",1
47,"A young blade runner's (Ryan Gosling) discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down older colleague (Harrison Ford), who's been missing for thirty years. In the future, there are people whose job is to find and kill human-like robots, you know, and they are called blade runners.Also appearing, Jared Leto, Robin Wright, Dave Bautista, Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Mackenzie Davis, David Dastmalchian et al.The original „Blade Runner“ (1982) is lauded as one of the best and most important sci-fi movies ever. I have seen it, of course, even more than once, and read the Philip K. Dick’s story it’s based on, but never see the appeal, honestly. Was quite bored with it, actually.So why do they like it so much? I am too lazy to research it on the interweb, so I am just gonna take a wild guess and offer that when it came out, it was a long-waited antidote to all the silly sci-fi movies craze that had ruled in the previous five years.You see, throughout history sci-fi was always a „serious“ and artsy cinema genre but then „Star Wars“ (1977) came out and made huge amount of people want something different entirely.So „Blade Runner“ was, for sci-fi geeks, a long-awaited return to form, with its moodiness, sombre atmosphere and deep philosophical questions such as what makes us „real“ anyway, and is human life more important than artificially created one.„Blade Runner“ flopped in cinemas originally but over the years it has built an admirable cult following. And the fans are surely glad to know that the long-planned sequel is finally here and stays far away from mainstream fare, respecting its „serious“ roots and everything.Yes, the trailers look spectacular and have plenty of rip-roaring action but the new „Blade Runner“ is all about returning to the form, easily supassing the original movie in every aspect, at least for yours truly.Be warned: not only does it last for close to three hours, it’s so artsy that you may feel the need to go grab some junk food later. Just to, you know, compensate.The story is slow, not too eventful, a few action setpieces, not much dialogue – and the existing sounds more like monologue than real natural conversation between persons.Filled with futuristic landscapes and environments, the movie looks gorgeous but there’s a noticeble discord between viewer and characters/events. The experience is cold and disheartening by design, always keeping you at arms length, so to speak.It does have Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford starring, but the result is far from perfect date movie… unless both are big movie lovers and/or loved the original „Blade Runner“.You may also have trouble with understanding the backstory and certain things about the characters. It is even difficult to say whether everything is meant to feel so ambiguous, asking us to offer our own answers, or the makers have tried to remain as „artsy“ as possible. I think it’s meant to be that hard to grasp. It’s directed by Denis Villeneuve after all („Prisoners“, „Enemy“, „Sicario“, „Arrival“).To be honest, the movie does not have any good reason to last for close to three hours, but at least it’s full of thoughtful and well-crafted material, not filler crap like many „event“ movies.The main topics such as the future of artifical intellect and the value of life, especially human life versus the artificially created one, are intriguing if you are able to open up to the whole experience.And if you manage to open up already, you may admire how spiritual this bleak and cold futuristic story can be at its core. I dug throught the symbolism evident in the story and found out that it is really about the importance of feelings – this is all you really have to get through life. Just what the spiritual systems have taught us for thousands of years.There will be many who will feel turned offed by this approach, I am sure. For an expensive 150 million U.S. dollar movie, it sure tries its earnest not to be easily liked and digested.But it’s gorgeous and after a while, you may notice that it really speaks to you. Some may dig the moodiness, or Gosling’s face, but there’s enough serious content beneath the surface.For all it’s emotional distant-ness and terrifying length, „Blade Runner 2049“ is not my cup of tea, but I think it’s a noteworthy piece of modern art. Considering the hefty budget, it is also probably the most expensive piece of modern art ever made.All in all, for what it is, the movie could not be better in any aspect. Except for maybe giving Leto a bigger role.",1
48,"Blade Runner 2049 returns very few of the characters from the original film but they manage to breathe life into this movie through the new ones they created. Officer K isn't the most lively protagonist but he gets an eye-opening character arc that kept me involved. Deckard doesn't appear till later in the movie but he remains interesting and what they decide to do with him makes his appearance worthwhile. I also really liked some of the smaller supporting characters. Sapper really helps kick off the movie, what Joi represents is extremely emotional and Mariette is so mysterious that her involvement brings up more and more questions. Add in that Niander Wallace and Luv make for pretty menacing villains and you have a pretty well-rounded and fascinating script.I don't think that the actors/actresses will be the focal point of the awards attention that this movie will get but that doesn't mean there aren't exemplary performances. Gosling is good as K, he's deliberately robotic and he accomplishes a lot through his subtlety. Harrison Ford isn't in the movie as much as I wanted him to be (he's still one of my all-time favourite actors) but he holds up his end. He works with Gosling well and they have a solid rapport. Surprisingly, I really liked Sylvia Hoeks. She stole a lot of her scenes and I thought she was great even acting against a stacked cast. Dave Bautista showed he has a lot more range than people give him credit for. Jared Leto is in a very Jared Leto role (deliberately weird and hard to understand) but he does it well and although he might be a little creepy, the guy is still a great actor. I also want to credit Ana de Armas, she was distinctly warm and she showed a lot more emotion than I had seen from her previously.",1
49,"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Yes, they do. So the film says, not the book. And new part of the Blade Runner continues the story of those who have souls, even if they're nothing more but replicants. Deep loud music written by Hans Zimmer with bright neon pictures of the future draws this world you'd never want to live in, but the world you'd want to take a look at. Blade runners still chasing replicants, replicats still trying to save their lifes. But now there's a greatest goal in this world. Replicants need to find a messiah, who will lead them to the freedom.",1
50,"Coming from a new fan, this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. Definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year. The cinematography was probably the best I've seen in a long while. I highly recommend this movie to anyone new fan or old.",1
51,Sziasztok. Hol is kezdjem. Ez a film valami zseniális. Rendezés hangvágás operatőri munka látvány színészek. Szinte hibátlan film. Ilyen jó sci-fi-t igen rég láttam.,1
52,"The best posible sequel to a cult classic like Blade Runner, with the most beautiful visuals I've ever seen. The story is deep with lots of symbolism and meaning, if you are expecting big action scenes and explosions everywhere this is not the movie for you. Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Ana de Armas, Leto, etc... everyone is goddamn perfect in its rol. Thank you Denis Villeneuve for this new master piece.",1
53,This movie is everything that I expected of it and more.It's amazing to see how a sequel in 2017 can top what used to be the best sci-fi of all time. This movie is actually better than the first Blade Runner movie.,1
54,"The original Blade Runner is still my overall favourite movie so far in time. I went into 2049 with high hopes. It met my expectations but does not surpass the original as I thought it would. The story is good, especially once the second half commences and a big plot reveal is made. Visuals are astounding and makes up for the length of the film. I felt the movie could have gone longer and I would have remained interested because of the cinematography and excellent acting. The only real let down for me is the musical score, it just didn't contain the same emotive vibe as Vangelis' provided in the original. To me Blade Runner breathes life because of that amazing soundtrack whereas 2049 was too low key and decidedly similar to many another sci-fi movies of recent years such as Oblivion and Interstellar. I hope there will be a ""Director's Cut"" once released on 4K/Bluray. I also hope one day Blade Runner will evolve into a story that includes the mysterious Off World location(s) that the to films elude to.I'm glad I saw 2049 on the big screen.",1
55,"This is the first movie that truly fills up my senses in almost every way; it kept me nervous and anxious in my seat, wishing that it would not end, even if it is +2 hours long. The environment they create is perfect and even better than the one in the first one, with a better arraignment of colors and perfect acting from the cast, making me believe every action and phrase they said. The story is very good, much better than the first one, but leaving me wishing for more of this world, something that I would not have said from watching the first one.",1
56,"As a sequel to the original 1982 film, this latest chapter from the blade runner universe holds its own. We find our protagonist, played by Ryan Gosling, working with the police to hunt down replicants, cyborgs indistinguishable from humans. A special mission sets him on a particularly dangerous path of self-discovery. Gosling is superb here. I initially criticised him as a choice for this role, but I was hands down wrong. He portrays the character with an innocence and sense of vulnerability that is very touching and heartfelt. Harrison Ford is excellent but doesn't have as much screen time as I'm sure fans were expecting. The story is well paced for the most part and manages to keep the audience engaged. I saw this in a huge theatre that was packed to the brim and you could've heard a pin drop throughout the entire screening.  The visuals are stunning and progressive without being separated too far from the first outing. It's creatively graded to emphasise certain atmospheres and moods which I found interesting. The attention to detail in the sets is impressive although most of it is CGI. The cinematography is also very impressive, and overall it's a beautifully conceived film. On the downside, at nearly 3 hours it's incredibly long, and you do start to feel that towards the last 30 minutes or so. Disappointingly, I also found some of the themes to be quite derogatory to women. Lots of brothels, hookers, nakedness, digital women created as companions. There was no gender balance in this somewhat sordid area. Although we did have a female villain, and head of police so at least some attempt at strong female characters admittedly. Overall, it's one of the best films of the year and will probably make the list as one of the finest sequels ever made. Highly recommended.",1
57,"An incredibly beautiful cinematography, a great story, great characters and performances, and a powerful and beauty ending. One of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.",1
58,"For me it was one of the best Sci Movies of the last decade. Amazing photography, scene... the actors are magnificent acting, Ryan gosling just astonishing.",1
59,"I don't know what can be possibly bad in this movie. It excels in everything it proposes itself.It is slow, yes. But it is slow in a positive way. Every scene is carefully thinked to be audiovisually exquisite. At that pace, you can truly think in the deep moral and phylosophical themes the movie proposes. You can suck all the main character's emotions.The world both blade runners have created is extremely interesting and coherent. I saw the first like 2 weeks before seeing Blade Runner 2049 and I consider myself a devote fan now.10/10 for me!",1
60,"Outstanding sequel, shame the millennials can't wrap their heads around it without an ""app for that"".  Continues the Philip K. Dick tale in great form, great cinema, great story. I suspect some the criticism is from people to lazy to read the book, or, watch either movie, or have no semblance of imagination, and just read critiques and pile on. Needs to be seen in a theater, do not wait for Redbox, pretend its 1982 and the VHS store isn't going to see a rental issued for at least two years!",1
61,Seen this on Imax with my Girlfriend and it is one of the best sequel to date. Don't watch it on Wi-Fi make sure its Hi-Fi because this is the best Sci-Fi. It is a well-delivered film the ASMR at portions of the film gives me chills. The surround sound of this film is also one of the best in film to date.,1
62,"Great movie in every aspect. The true sequel of Blade Runner. The movie has stunning visuals, incredible music and plot is very solid. I don't afraid of Dune adaptation any more.",1
63,"It was more than what I was expecting and I was expecting quite a bit. It was ""wow!"" from start to finish and had me immersed in the world of Blade Runner. This is what reading a good book or playing a good video game feels like when it's over...just...overwhelmingly great.I can't wait for this to come out on blu ray so I can watch it another dozen times.",1
64,"The histoty retains fidelity to original of 1982, especially in philosophical context. It stans out in particular for the design of production -that tributes Metropolis- Roger Deakins photography and Hans Zimmer score. One of best choices of autumn 2017.",1
65,"Blade Runner 2049 is in my mind the best looking movie i've seen in a long time. But the story isn't slacking either, its beautifully written and just super super like good",1
66,"good acting, music, scenery, sound (was too loud though)....................................................................................................................................................",1
67,Couldn't have been better made to do justification to the original cult classic. Audio-visual treat and beautiful storytelling. Box office performance was expected to be low considering the original movie was too catering to a particular cult following.,1
68,"With the first film being my favorite film, i was hoping for big things with this film. It did not disappoint, however after the first viewing i was unsure what i had watched,being unable to quite figure it out. But after the second viewing i realised that like the first it is a master craft and years down the road many will come to have this are their favorite film.Visually amazing,the story whilst paying homage is its own film, and what else can you say about the cinematography, its unbelievable. It's just just sad that the box office is not being reflective of how good this is.Highly recommend!",1
69,"Those SJWs can piss off am I right? Seriously though, this is the kind of movie that shows exactly why people make movies. This is the kind of movie that we'll look back in thirty years and when everyone complains how no one makes good movies we can tell them it's because they never went to see them. Every shot is eyegasmic, every scene blocked well, all performances are perfect, Villeneuve consistently proves himself as one of the best modern directors. This movie is about as perfect as it gets when it comes to films.",1
70,"One of the best movies I've ever had a chance to watch in theater. The cinematography, direction, and acting are some of the strongest I've seen in quite some time, especially considering the style of movie it is. To some it may feel a bit long, which is understandable, but it is still the best sequel made since The Dark Knight, and before that, The Godfather II. Kudos to all involved.",1
71,"It's not quite the instant classic the first movie was, but it was nearly impossible to do so anyway. This new Blade runner a an excellent movie nonetheless. I've read some bad reviews before watching the film and was kinda sceptical, but in the end this movie is about as good a sequel can get. The visuals obviously are astonishing, the music is creepy and moody, and the story is gripping, good enough for me. Still It has some weaker moments, especially the last 20-30 minutes. The movie then become a bit messy and schizophrenic. But It's those crucial last 20 minutes that would have made Blade Runner 2049 a masterpiece like the first, but it kinda miss the spot. I also didn't like the Jared Leto character, the guru who speaks in parabolas and metaphors...it felt a bit cliché to me. Despite all that i can't give a lower score than 9, since the movie overall really lives up to the expectations. It's the kind movie I will watch 5-6 times without getting tired, this Blade Runner universe is just too fascinating.",1
72,"Blade Runner 2049 is a audio-visual masterpiece which thrives on its innovative scenery - each location is unique. It's hard not to get mesmerized by it's thrilling story which leaves as many questions open as it answers. The three hour experience holds your attention up to a point where you don't want it to stop. While the acting doesn't deliver anything out of the ordinary, the attention-grabbing unlinear storytelling combined with purely beautiful cinematography makes this film a true gem. This is one to watch over and over again.",1
73,"A super smart, dark, mysterious, and methodical sci-fi flick that we rarely get these days. It's an anti toxin for all the popcorn, blow 'em up action movies masquerading around as sci-fi. The absolute best thing of this movie is the atmosphere, backed by a near 200 million dollar budget this futuristic world comes to life and leaves you wanting to see more of it even after the near 3 hour runtime. Flying cars, super realistic ruined landscapes, holographic advertisement in the streets, and amazing sound effects bring it all too life.Acting there wasn't a bad character in the film. Most stoic in personality, too match the oppressed world. Gosling is solid, although not quite oscar worthy I'd say. At one point he yells at the top of his lungs when he finds out a critical piece of information, it was one of the best moments for him and the film could use a little more of that from him. Silvia Hoeks is downright chilling as the central villain, a little too ""female terminator"" at the end but one of the most convincing female villains I've seen. Overall the women in this show brought the movie up from good to excellent. All were spot on in their roles and memorable characters. Ford is featured less in the film than the advertisements might indicate. He did better in this than in the Force Awakens, partly from having a more important, convincing role. Quibbles as I said before, Gosling could run the gamut of emotions a little more often. The final fight scene a little overdone, and a few too many things put in for sequel purposes (which we may never get). There are a ton of details packed in this movie. You'll need at least 2 viewings to catch everything. Too bad it didn't perform as good as expected, we may never see another true sci-fi epic on this scale.",1
74,"Denis Villeneuve has made a $150 million art film that also happens to be a sequel. Roger Deakins' cinematography a career best here; the way he plays with natural light and color is breathe-taking. The costume design is impeccable as well; the outfits look like they belong on a runway without feeling disconnected from the universe. Sadly it is not for everyone. While the pace is steady, some people will certainly find it slow and boring. However, in my humble opinion, Blade Runner 2049 is the best film of the year, and superior to Ridley Scott's original Blade Runner.",1
75,"First of all what i loved the most is the atmosphere and the story telling. I had watched the first one before and was impressed by how little dialogue was needed to move the plot along and to convey the message. Most recent movies left me with a sower aftertaste and with the impression that it was numbed down by having a huge amount of dialogue and explanations. The original used the atmosphere, the sounds and the characters to tell it's story and the difference from the modern approach was really obvious.  The feeling i had while watching the original i found again while seeing 2049.It is a sequel but without making you feel that not watching the original was a big mistake.  This was the one movie in a very long time that did not disappoint me. I have loved it. It is something else and i could go on and on about the plot twist that was introduces incredibly well but at the same time was not in your face and then what happened afterwards when you felt that you passed the traditional twist... Anyway, if you love SciFi movies and have felt violated by the abortions that came out in the last years (at most 3 were good) or the traditional Hollywood recipes i cannot recommend this one enough.",1
76,"10/10. Way underseen movie that made much less money than it should have. This is a true successor to the original Blade Runner, and is a completely self contained story. There is no sequel baiting here, though one could be made if they wanted to. This is unlikely though, seeing as how, while highly rated, the film just didn't bring in the audiences to make the kind of money that the production company was hoping for, and it's made quite a bit more money over seas than in the American market. It did make back it's budgeted money and with a small profit to boot, but the numbers just aren't there such that this will likely be the last Blade Runner movie. That being said, this movie will certainly live on as a sci-fi cult classic for years to come! This is easily the best movie that I have seen all year. The acting was superb by everyone, especially Ryan Gossling. Honestly, I haven't been a huge fan of Ryan as he normally acts in a lot of romance and artsy fartsy types of films that don't interest me much (see ""The Notebook"" and ""La La Land""), but this movie showed me what a broad actor he truly is and the depth of his acting ability. As for aesthetics, the movie is beautifully shot. The cinematography is very cool and the CGI isn't noticeable. The story is also amazing. It more than lives up to the standards set in the first film and in my opinion surpasses it. Also, in some ways, BR 2049 more resembles the original work ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" by Philip K. Dick (the book that Blade Runner is based on) than the first film. Obviously neither film are really all that close to the book except in general concepts, but 2049 captures the dystopia portrayed in the book much better than the first movie did, likely due to advances in our film technology. I won't go into the story too much as I don't want to spoil anything. All I will say is that this film explores many of the same questions in the first movie and then some, with plenty of twists and turns and revelations to keep you hooked from beginning to end.Denis Villeneuve as director, once again proves himself to be a true modern master. Many people have been complaining about where the next generation of genius directors are to replace people like Coppola, Scorsese, Spielburg, Kubrick, Stone, and Scott. With the exception of the Cohen and Nolan brothers we seem to be in a drought in our modern age of new upcoming genius directors, especially when the lions share of films are made by Michael ""BOOM SPLOSIONS"" Bay and J.J. ""Lens Flare"" Abrams. Well, one day we may very well be adding Villeneuve to that list of true masters if he continues to create movies like this.Conclusion: If it's still in your local theater, GO SEE BLADE RUNNER 2049! It's my choice for Best Picture, and it would be criminal in my book if it wan't even nominated.",1
77,"Denis Villeneuve unmistakably captures the tone and aesthetic of the Blade Runner universe, while bringing an original story that further explores the predecessor's themes. Combining that with state of the art visual effects and compelling new characters, Blade Runner 2049 is exactly how a modern sequel to a classic cinematic experience should be tackled.",1
78,"Like a fine cognac, you have to be in the right mood and without distractions to thoroughly enjoy this Masterpiece.  Time will prove this....like the original.",1
79,"Blade Runner 2049 is a shining successor to the original. It stays true to the first movie in almost every way. While there were a few dry sections toward the beginning, the overall design of the film begins to dawn on you toward the end. I reconsidered my entire opinion of this movie from a negative to a positive one somewhere past the halfway point. I hope the success of this one means many more additions to the Blade Runner universe.",1
80,"Overall the movie is enjoyable, with stunning visuals and great score. It lacks that punchy Hollywood action and buildup. But the movie sticks to its theme and genre and explores what it is to be human. It is definitely a critical masterpiece and surely be nominated for Academy awards.",1
81,"Very good, movie. Keeps you entertained and engaged in the story throughout its long playtime. The lore, the environment and the risks it takes with the subplots is well written.",1
82,"Бегущий по лезвию 2049- качественный и прекрасно сделанный фильм, не утративший дух оригинала. Это фильм с хорошим актерским составом и с неплохим сценарием и отличной картинкой. Что в фильме не понравился, так это слабый злодей и ляпы в сюжете. В целом фильм отличный, всем рекомендую идти!",1
83,"Easily one of the best movies in the gere among years.. since Avatar i think. With a lot of turn, while it's amazing to watch also catch your mind to think about things that are happening",1
84,"Blade Runner 2049 will probably be looked back upon in the future as one of the more compelling sci-fi dramas of all time. It executes nearly everything to perfection, continuing to build upon some of the great aspects of the first film while being able to avoid some of the narrative blunders of the original. The setting and visuals of the film are beyond beautiful. It does a great job of building upon the already majestic world of blade runner while adding some unique aspects of its own that helps it not feel like just an extension of the first film. The music is subtly very good as it helps you feel immersed into the film while not feeling overbearing. The narrative and characters are the things that stand out most about the film. Despite being nearly 3 hours long, it almost never feels boring and is captivating the whole way through. The only time I noticed that the film slowed down a bit was around the end of the first hour of the film, but quickly picks back up again and is incredibly engaging the rest of the way through. Ryan Gosling gives a great performance as he usually does and Harrison Ford gives one of the best performances of his career. Ana de Armas also gives a surprisingly good performance, although her character occasionally felt underutilized. Blade Runner 2049 is an amazing film that both fans of the original and new fans alike should enjoy.",1
85,"Película visualmente muy bella, con buena fotografía y efectos. tal vez uno de los fallos es demorar algunas escenas mas de lo necesario ademas de ser lenta, esto puede llegar a ser aburrido o tedioso para algunos espectadores, aunque a mi en lo personal me gusto. En cuanto a la trama me parece muy buena, es cierto que tiene algunos fallos de guion muy pequeños, pero en general muy buena pelicula.",1
86,"Smart. Elegant. Beautiful. Relevant. All the things ""great Sci-fi"" is and can be will be found in this film. Beautiful performances captured by an innovative Director bring to life an amazing story in the world of ""Blade Runner"" WETA workshop outdoes themselves in their amazing model work as well as in the digital effects arena and this screenplay is passionate and powerful with a deep respect of the art that came before it. Hollywood should focus on making more pictures like THIS and less like ""Transformers 5"".",1
87,"One of my favourites of the year. An absolutely visually stunning movie deserves the Special Effects Oscar this year for sure. The sound is also amazing the soundtrack and sound effects really immerse you into the film. All of the performances lead by Ford and Gosling were very good. The movie is a little long a few boring scenes, if it was cut down by 15 minutes or so it would be an almost perfect movie. A must see this year.",1
88,It had moments that gave me that inner tingle that surged through my entire body.  Only a handful of movies have ever be able to hit those nerves so well. Truly remarkable cinema.,1
89,"Though this may sound less like a review, but I will put it as simply. Words cannot describe this film, and only by watching it will you understand why it deserves this 10. From the stunningly beautiful and well-crafted cinematography, and with a plot giving the film it's a standalone perspective. Even as a sequel, Blade Runner 2049 is truly a film never to forget.",1
90,"This was by far my favourite film of the year. It has a clear and well executed vision, sumptuous visuals, an intriguing plot, which is a strong natural sequel to the original film, not some un-necessary ""reboot"" or unconnected story. The acting is great and the ending really well done. Some said the movie was too long, but I didn't think so.",1
91,"Wow! The potential of this movie was so big. I really loved the way each scene led to the next. I loved the transitions, pacing, timing of the scenes and emotions and colors. It was just so well done! However, I found the story really hard to follow. I wanted to understand because it all seemed so well put together but this is one of those movies where I will need to watch again and again and then also read a summary online to really grasp what was happening. I would love to watch this movie in a 7.1 surround with a UHD TV though... wow it's beautiful and deserves to be rewatched for its beauty and complex story.",1
92,"I dont know wich film i love more if this one or the original, so this movie is almoast perfect i cant see anything wrong in it or something that ill change but still i wouldnt recomended it because is too slow and its not for everybody. Loved Ryan as ""K"", Dennis getting better film after film and Deakins is god in it.",1
93,"In an extremely rare case, I believe Blade Runner 2049 manages to outdo the original story it's based on. The acting and writing superb, atmosphere is glowing and awe-inspiring, the direction is top-notch, and the story is just as great as the first one. The score by Hans Zimmer and Ben Wallfisch is arguably the best of the year and holds true to Vangelis' original score and exceeds it in many ways. This film encapsulates everything a movie sequel or remake should do: expand on the original's ideas and improve on it. Blade Runner 2049 does just that, making it a rare sequel that can match the legendary original.",1
94,"Excellent film. Perfectly picks up where the original left off and continues with the themes of empathy vs. artificiality. Some questions we had from the original film were answered, and some things were purposely left unsaid in true Bladerunner fashion. I don't want to give anything away, but fans of the original film will not be disappointed.",1
95,"Blade Runner 2049 is a spectacle in story, sound, and visuals. A flawless piece of film making that should receive numerous awards, especially for Roger Deakins the time is now give this man his Oscar already. This is a true masterpiece!! A+",1
96,"It's been years since I've experienced a movie in theatres where almost every image left me in awe. Not impressed, not merely captivated, but in awe. In most “good looking” films, it's easy to find several scenes in images where your eyes feel like shrugging compared to the rest of the film's imagery. It was difficult to find very many scenes like that in Blade Runner 2049. Even when there's next to no visual action going on in the frame, these images still find a way to impress. But thankfully, there's more to Blade Runner 2049 than just pretty pictures. Director Denis Villeneuve never forgets that this is a Blade Runner movie, a dark mystery about what it really means to be human in a world filled to the brim with advanced technology. The lovely visuals aid the story, instead of trying to bury it.The sound design also really helps in bringing this troubled world to life. The musical score, while lacking the magic of Vangelis's score for the original film, still works in harmony with the moods and emotions for each scene. From throat-singing in Wallace's (Jared Leto) chamber, to the menacing drums used for a futuristic L.A.P.D. tower, to the playful chimes used in Detective K's romantic encounters with the optimistic Joi (Ana De Armas); these little touches in the soundtrack truly emphasize the emotion of each scene. Again, supporting the film, not trying to make up for it. It's a miracle that this soundtrack turned out as good as it did, considering the last minute change of composers and the fact that the soundtrack is almost entirely original. And of course, a dystopia could never come to life without convincing sound effects, and Blade Runner 2049 is no exception. This is an overused statement, but every sound used outside of the soundtrack truly feels real. No blaster sounds, no explosions that sound way quieter than they should, and no other silly overused sci-fi sound effects. Every bang, crash, jump, shot, step, and yell sounds exactly like it should. For example, in Dave Bautista's scene, we originally find him farming in a heavy radioactive suit. And with that moment, we can hear the heavy steps, echoes, and breathing that would go on in such a suit. The audience is there in his suit, and we didn't need any cheap POV or overlong establishing shots to get that level of immersion. It's such a short, inconsequential scene, but it's impressive that even the smallest scenes in Blade Runner 2049 are trying to pull you into its world instead of pushing you away.And then, we arrive at the final stage of crafting a fictional world: the characters. Admittedly, there are few characters that feel like they never get any time to properly develop. Although, looking back at the film, maybe that's because I enjoyed their company so much. Ryan Gosling, an actor who should win the most improved actor award at this point, is perfect as a morally conflicted detective. I truly believed every step of his struggle, every emotion he conveyed, and every blow to his face. And this is all done without a shred of overacting or “phoning it in”, so to speak. Harrison Ford, reprising his role as Deckard, feels like he's actually acting this time. I was afraid that he was gonna “Bruce Willis” this important role, but he actually delivered. Is it because Harrison actually cares about this character? Or because the director cared enough to get him to actually act? Who knows? What matters is that he conveys a character that is both emotionally devastated and slightly desensitized to his previous events. All of the actors also suit their characters quite well, especially Jared Leto as Wallace and Ana De Armas as Joi. The actors certainly make the film's world all the more interesting and emotional, even when the story and writing fail to do so.It truly shows how special this film is, however, that these story flaws seem so small. This is still an intriguing mystery story with a lot of tricks up it's sleeve, even for longtime fans of Blade Runner and dystopian Science Fiction. It's also impressive that the film never loses touch of it's themes, like the first film this is still a story about how life and reality can even be considered special in a society filled with technology and prejudice. And it's a breath of fresh air that every aspect of the film effectively conveys that message, instead of just a clever script and a few great performances. Yes, the film isn't quite as smart or clever as it's predecessor, but any movie that gets even close to reaching the magic of Blade Runner is well worth your time. The visual experience alone is worth the price of admission, but thankfully there's so much more lurking beneath the smooth surface.See it in IMAX if you can.",1
97,"Firstly the negatives - its not a popcorn movie. If you see that as a positive rather than a negative, then its likely you will really enjoy this masterpiece of a sequel. You really need to have seen the first film, if you enjoyed the first then this film  should be a treat. The story, cinematography, acting, and sound are as good as you could hope for and this is the best follow up to any film I've seen.Blade Runner is one of my favorite films, this has just been added to my list. I wont spoil the story but you wont see many better sequels than this.",1
98,"What a movie, Denis Villeneuve delivers again! I honestly cannot fault this film, it was gripping from start to finish. Every scene is carefully crafted, and oozes with atmosphere.",1
99,"WOW – a near perfect sci-fi movie. I have seen a lot of shorter films, that felt much longer than BR2049. Every minute of BR2049 is important. From the long “atmosfear” scenes, that does nothing more that add depth to the dark, sinister, gray world that is BR2049. Stunning sound and visuals go hand in hand to create a world like no other. Gosling, Armas, Leto and Ford all do a great job in bringing their characers to life. See it in I-MAX if possible !For me a much more powerful I-MAX experience than Dunkirk.",1
100,"From the spectacular acting performances, to the groundbreaking special effects, to the very effective story, Blade Runner 2049 has everything to make a good sequel. Villeneuve directed a masterpiece. I do believe that this movie will go down in history as not only one of the best sequels, but also, as one of the best science fiction movie ever made. I highly recommend watching this one.",1
101,"For me, the ""Blade Runner, 2049"" was the most anticipated film of the year. Ditched the pair for first in session and in view I can say that the expectations are justified. We have the same old Blade Runner — the philosophy in the cyberpunk world of the future, which is accompanied by gorgeous visuals, sincavage sound and neon signs. As a sequel, the tape looks incredibly well from the first minute it is visible that the project was a true fan of the original film. The atmosphere absorbs the head, the events stretch smoothly and slowly, which is a characteristic feature of the series and for many it is a minus (but not me). Despite the close relationship with the original, tape Villeneuve is sure to surprise and show something new. Almost completely disappeared aesthetics of film Noir, and instead proposed increased portion of action and a greater variety of locations, introduces viewers to the world of the future outside of big cities. Speaking about the actors and their characters I would like to highlight Dave Batista, which was very little, but in such a short amount of screen time he managed to create a memorable and interesting way, the background which can be seen in the short prequel to ""2048: Nowhere to run"", filmed by Luke Scott. Also for a small fraction of the duration in time perfectly to reveal the characters of Jared Leto and Harrison Ford. The latter even in the joint scenes with the main character managed to pull the viewer's attention on himself his endless charisma. The Key Officer in the performance of Ryan Gosling is ambiguous. In General, the role of the canadian classic — Ryan plays silent maloemotsionalny young people with a sad look, and in this film it is also due to the peculiarities of the character.There were, of course, and without the drawbacks. For me, the obvious shortcomings of steel sagging narrative at the end of the first hour timekeeping, small, slow, even compared to the original tape, not until the end of the open arches of the characters (mostly Wallace), as well as the soundtrack. He, of course, good, Hans Zimmer as always on top, but still a new ""Running"" lacks the charm that gave the tracks by Vangelis, composer of the first part. But none of these minuses can not name at least serious, why the impressions of the paintings remain very positive. Done a great job with the material, the technical side of the film is just beyond praise and deserves at least Oscar nominations for the soundtrack, visual effects and cinematography. A worthy continuation of the classic, which once again proved to everyone that Denis Villeneuve is one of the best directors of our day.",1
102,"Film was great (in my point of view). Long but realy great. Fantastic atmosphere,beautiful audio, good actors job and nise plot. But you realy need to watch first Blade Runner to understand everyting. On the other side film is specific and long.(Sorry for my grammar, i am  not  a native speaker)",1
103,"I've always loved the original Blade Runner, but never held it quite as high as many other sci-fi fans do. It does so many things incredibly well, but a certain chilliness always prevented me from fully connecting to it. Blade Runner 2049 is a different story. It's equally chilly on the surface, but has a warm, beating heart at its core.Everything I didn't get out of the original, I got here. Director Denis Villeneuve and crew take the world, atmosphere, and themes created by Ridley Scott's team in 1982, and expertly expand upon those elements, providing a more intriguing plot, and more well-rounded characters for you to connect to.Villenueve continues to prove he's one of the best in the business right now, pumping out great films year after year after year. He can seemingly do no wrong. The visuals in this thing are absolutely mind-blowing as well. I'll be shocked if the legendary Roger Deakins doesn't finally get his Oscar for this film. And The production designs is simply outstanding. I truly felt as if I had been transported to another place and time. Despite running 40 minutes longer than the original film, it never dragged. I never felt the need to check the time. It's perfectly paced, totally engaging, and as of right now, Blade Runner 2049 is my favorite film of 2017.",1
104,"This movie has been not doing well in cinemas and this is the reason we get Movies like Transformers more often than these kinds of masterpiece. I loved everything about this movie. The music was awesome,visuals are just so delicious and looked so real, the story was open ended for the viewers to theorize, it was so intelligently made and made people wonder how things came to be and i love the fact that the movie didnt give us all the answers at the end. Great performace from Gosling, he kind of carried the movie all the way through. Jared Leto was just weird, dont know if its a praise or criticism lol. MUST WATCH and save CINEMA",1
105,"Visually stunning, fantastic progressive storytelling with satisfying and emotionally charged reveals.The length of this film was a little overwhelming but that is just a minor issue amongst such a fantastic experience.",1
106,"Wow! What can i say, as soon as this movie ended i knew that it was going to be a long time before a ever saw a quality sci-fi like this again. I am a fan of the original and this one is as good. A masterpiece for sure and it expands significantly the original story. I relished every minute of this film and wish that the bluray version comes with a longer version (yes more more more). Kudos the french Canadian (Quebec) director Denis Villeneuve for nailing this!",1
107,"Blade Runner 2049 is a beautiful movie with some of the best cinematography I have ever seen. Although it did not attract many fans other than the typical Sci-Fi dystopian fan, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I give it a 9/10",1
108,"Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best, most provocative, and DEFINITELY one of the best looking movie of the year. Ryan Gosling gives one the best and most subtle performances he's ever given, and Harrison Ford is great as well. Denis Villeneuve is proving to be one of the best directors working today, and I can't wait to see what he does next!",1
109,"Probably my favorite sci-fi movie, which is surprising since I have no love for the original. Minor plotholes are nothing against stunning visuals, great performances, excellent dialogue, interesting themes, fun twists and perfectly slow tempo.",1
110,"If you want a true return to form for Blade Runner and for sci-fi in general then you will be very satisfied with this movie. This movie checks all the correct boxes. Deep and complex characters, great and inspired acting, beautiful and artistic settings and scenery and cinematography, fantastic music and sounds, and a story that is subtle and interesting and pulls you in. This director, Denis Villeneuve, is creating the best science fiction of this generation, and perhaps the best science fiction ever. I couldn't have enjoyed this film any more.",1
111,"'it's 40 miles of bad road.I can't stress how long, and amazing this film is, it is interesting along with great character developments and twists and turns all the way.",1
112,"I've always held 'Blade Runner' as one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. As a self-proclaimed film connoisseur, I believed a sequel to a film of such magnitude could never do it justice. However, I was proven (not totally) wrong with '2049'. It posed deep, meaningful questions of what it means to be human, to have emotions. The cinematography and score helped to match the atmosphere with the original in a way I never thought it would. My criticisms lie with the pace, and Gosling, who comes off as pedestrian. As a sequel though, it's an amazing movie.",1
113,"There are great films, then there are films that can change your life.I am in no way a critic. I am just a fan and a lover of films. So allow me to indulge myself by writing why Blade Runner 2049 became one of my favorite films of all time.Let me start by saying that I didn’t like the original Blade Runner. I know it sounds blasphemous considering it’s a cult classic and is highly regarded as one of the most influential sci-fi films of all time. But for me, it felt too dragging and predictable at times. So I went to see 2049 with tempered expectations. I mean, I could’ve just skipped it but seeing director Denis Villeneuve’s previous works (Enemy, Arrival) I had this gut feel that he would do something special. I’m glad I didn’t skip because my gut feel was damn right.Rarely do you see a blockbuster filled with depth and so many layers. After the credits rolled all I could say was “What?” because it’s tough to digest everything at first. But after thinking about it, together with reading articles and watching videos about it, I started to understand the movie which eventually led to me loving it. I read comments about it saying that the film tried to say a lot of things which eventually resulted in it being messy. While I agree that the film tries to say a lot, I don’t think that it’s messy. For me, it actually depicted the mind of someone who’s asking what it means to be human. Asking that question will lead to more questions than answers. That is what happens to Ryan Gosling’s Officer K.Officer K is somehow trying to find his place in the world. This resonates with me a lot because I’m at the point in my life where I feel lost and I can’t seem to figure out where I should be. The film also asks what it means to be alive and what it is that makes us special. K lived his entire life knowing that he’s just a replicant hunting other replicants. Nothing more, nothing less. So when he discovered something that showed him he might be more than just a Blade Runner, he believed it. He believed that he is special, that there is more to his life than just the routine. He believed that there is more to him that what people say. That was the first time he felt truly special. But it turns out (spoiler alert!) that he’s just a decoy. He wasn’t so special after all. In a way, I can connect with that as well. Sometimes I ask myself if there’s more to life than the routine and the norm. Like K, I want to be special. I want to feel like I’m important and I mean something. I grew up in an environment where people downplay this longing and tell me I shouldn’t go after what I want. It makes me think that I’m just a peg in a board game and someone else is playing it. I feel like a small piece in a grand scheme just like how the replicants are. It makes me feel irrelevant. Eventually, K accepted the fact that he’s just a piece and played his part knowing that there’s a bigger picture. I think he felt like that was his true purpose, being one of the catalysts of change. Unlike K though, I’ve yet to accept that I’m just a peg and I still haven’t discovered my true individual purpose.These are just some of the realizations I had that prove Blade Runner 2049 is a very deep, philosophical film. Based on the articles I’ve read, people always got something different from it and that’s why I love it. The film is open to interpretation because of how layered it is. At the heart of Villeneuve’s films, you’ll always see humanity in them and 2049 is a prime example. My only gripe with the film is that it’s a tad too long. Maybe that’s one of the main reasons why other people are hesitant to watch it and might’ve contributed to it’s somewhat poor performance at the box office. Less people who watched means less people I can talk to and discuss about my feelings for it. But other than that, the film is really great. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is near-perfect. Almost every shot looks stunning. It’s gorgeous. If the philosophical story doesn’t pique your interest, then watch it only for the visuals. It’s worth your money. I really hope that it goes down as a sci-fi classic much like its predecessor.I can’t wait to buy my own original DVD and watch it over and over again to discover more layers. But while it’s still in the cinemas, go watch it and experience one of the best movies ever made.",1
114,It's movies like Blade Runner 2049 that are keeping the magic of cinema alive and it absolutely demands to be experienced on the biggest screen available. Ignore the relatively few low scores and see arguably one of the best ever films of it's genre.,1
115,"In my opinion I found Blade Runner 2049 a masterpeice on its own merits that remained respectful to Blade Runner, its longer more grand than the original. The film as some amazing visuals, cinemaphotography with an epic and hypnotic soundtrack with some unique industrial and electronic beats. I found that the sequal got me thinking a lot more than the original, all the cast played their parts well. I would advise to give this film a chance and go to watch this film if you're a fan of the original and if you love cyberpunk sic-fi and a thinking man's film and most of all a fan of Blade Runner.",1
116,"This is an amzing movie if you're prepared for a slow, complex and heavily atmospheric experience. If you're fine with all of that, then you will love this movie.",1
117,"A masterpiece through and through. My mind was blown away. The layers upon layers that this movie builds up and then peels away are jaw-dropping. Beyond the great plot, the film oozes with symbolical substance that adds to the impact of the story whether it be visually or musically. Biblical, political, environmental, universal themes are all added as spices to this delicious concoction of science-fiction glory. Every scene and nuance is cinematic gold. The most consistently outstanding cinematography I've seen in a long time. Great movies believe their audience to be intelligent, this film believes so and is actively trying to outfox you, always being one step ahead and thus making the viewer wonder what is next while leaving food for thought for a second viewing. Once you have reached the core at the end, you feel as though you have been unraveled yourself. The 2hr 45min runtime gave them the perfect time to give us the best possible sequel they could and they surpassed all expectations with an epic. You'd think it's a long time but not when you are hooked from the first shot. This is the greatest sci-fi trip since The Matrix. I recommend seeing it in IMAX or another large format theater. Enjoy.",1
118,"""Break the world""... that is exactly what this film has done. A dark, deep, and mesmerizing ode to the 1982 original that redefined the genre, Blade Runner 2049 is a science fiction phenomenon. Like his predecessor, the great Ridley Scott, Denis Villenueve has managed to preserve the artificial heart of the first Blade Runner, crafting a personal story in an impersonal world. But this time, the dark, foggy streets of LA and the technotopia which surrounds it isn't just seen, it is lived. This is a film which demands attention and patience, and rewards you with a compelling, thought provoking, and heart-wrenching story, interesting characters, and some old fashioned sci-fi fun. For die hard Blade Runner fans, this is the sequel of our electric dreams, checking off all of the boxes, hitting ever mark seamlessly; resuscitating the mind-bending world of cyber-punk that was left for dead with the Matrix in 1999.",1
119,"A rare sequel that improves its predecessor without changing it. Masterful, expansive, devastating. Ridley Scott could not have made this film--it cares so much about the soul of the original. That soul is present in every frame of this very different film.",1
120,"Well done, Mr. Villeneuve. Finally a good example for Jar Jar Abrams and Disney how to make a sequel.The sound was a bit too obtrusive and oversteered in the cinema I watched this.",1
121,"The tone of the original has been recreated and advanced in a convincing and worthwhile way, for better or for worse. Where the original inspired many sci-fi pieces over the last twenty or thirty years, the sequel clearly borrows from the genre, with one of its several twists being borrowed from the very Blade-Runner-ish Battlestar Galactica.As many references to the original as there are, some work better than others. I can live with an Edward James Olmos cameo, but Sean Young was really awkwardly shoehorned in. The funny references to long lost companies permeate the background and that's cool, but what's less cool is the ubiquitous Hans Zimmer aping the electronic soundscape of the original but completely missing the meditative quality of Vangelis' original.On its own merits though, the new Blade Runner is more of a thinker's movie than most, and offers several intriguing twists, memorable characters, and iconic imagery. It's worth seeing, and going in without spoilers, and giving a think as to how far away we are from its world right now.",1
122,"""Pain reminds you the joy you felt was real"".Wow! WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW! And another WOW!""Blade Runner 2049"" is a fantastic follow up to the first and fixes a lot of the issues people had with the 1982 film. Without any director or extended cut. It's everything a sequel should do. Hell, you can watch this without watching the first and wouldn't get lost. Something ""Force Awakes"", ""Jurassic World"", and ""Finding Dory"" should take notes on. This is the type of film that will inspire young film makers out there to pick up a camera and make art. It's that great.As I said in my ""Arrival"" review, Denis Villeneuve can release a movie every year and be close of making a masterpiece. This is the masterpiece. When ""Prisoners"" and ""Enemy"" was released, a lot of people saw great promise for him in the future, but never has a director live up to that praise. You can see the love and respect he has for the original without cheating out by playing on your nostalgic to win you over, not with Blade Runner. He also brings something new to the universe and made the whole thing thought-provoking.Roger Deakins continues to out shine himself with every film his apart of, however this might be his best work yet. The beautiful imagery, framing, the use of darkest and neon lights really adds to the amazement of the world building. It's one of the most good looking films I've this year and nothing will top it. I swear if this doesn't get him that long and well deserved Oscar, then nothing will. I lost respect for the Academy a long time ago, but this will make them look spineless.The performances from everyone were all fantastic. Ryan Gosling and Robin Wright are great as always. Harrison Ford gave probably the best performance I've seen from him. And Jared Leto redeeming himself after the garbage fire that was ""Suicide Squad"", despite the small screen time. I finally saw him playing a character, not a try-hard 'look at my method acting'.The score was incredible and has this blasting roar to it that the speakers at my cinema literally vibrated every time. I didn't see it in IMAX, it's that effective.What surprised me more is how engaging the story was and how emotional it got. By the end, I felt a tear coming down my eye. Little CGI was used in certain aspects as it went for a more practical path with it's effects. The final result is remarkable.Overall rating: Villeneuve nailed what many thought was impossible. My eye for his next movie has gone up sky high. Please go support this.",1
123,"Great film. Everyone gives a great performance and the visuals are incredible. This is a movie that is a must watch in the theaters. But unfortunately no one is watching it. Which is a little surprising for how big the original film was. The film does a very good Job by laying out it?s story. A lot of the great twist and turns to drive story forward as well. This will appeal to any sci-fi fan or anyone who love the original. It does a great job by building off the original film rather than going off the beaten path and doing something that is too far fetched. The score also is incredible and it gives a great tone to the film. I believe this will be nominated for best visuals, best score, and best picture of the year. Go watch the movie its worth every 2 hours and 44 minutes.",1
124,"This movie is everything a good film should be, regardless of if it's a sequel or not. Everything is top notch, from Dennis Villeneuve's direction, to the fantastic production design, to Roger Deakins' breathtaking cinematography, to stellar performances from Gosling, Ford, Leto, Wright, and especially Sylvia Hoeks who so deserves an Oscar nom for her performance, to the amazing visual effects, to the excellent score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch that stands on it's own and tributes Vangelis's iconic original score, to the sound design. It is all here!As a sequel, it continues what made the first film good and expands upon it's universe, as well as tribute the original film but can stand on it's own, as an a stand-alone film it is great, where viewers not familiar with the cult classic can understand what is going on without getting lost.",1
125,"My review after watching IMAX. Having seeing the first Blade Runner and how amazing I thought the original movie was, I had extremely high expectations on the sequel. This is not a perfect movie and had some missed opportunities where the story could have further developed and shined more to have it become a true masterpiece, but overall this was definitely a solid 8+. Let's starts with the pros:Amazing cast of characters and actors! I really thought Ryan Gosling (Officer K) did a fantastic job! And the other two amazing characters was Officer K - AI lover- JOI (Ana De Armas) and Jared Leto (Wallace). Visuals- Were amazing and loved them the artistic theme and colors.. But I wished they used less CGI and more real and authentic sceneries. The CGI felt to sterile, clean and less grit in the real world. Music- was great! But, I felt they tried very hard to keep it up with the original Blade runner. I really loved the Jazz tones and 60's nostalgia- that was amazing!!. But I would have preferred more classical synthesized electronic tones and the credits music was horrible- heavy metal. They could have put like 80's theme style music/ song rolling through the credits. My biggest beef was the story and some of the sterile CGI stuff. While I don't want to spoil anything, I just felt they could have really done a better job building the character's relationships and development. I would have been more emotionally attached vs feeling I don't care if this person dies. Something that Nier Automata (Video Game) does a much better job making feel more attach to ""replicants"". Frankly, I was more attached to Officer's K AI relationship more than Deckard to his..... I think this was a great movie but maybe I need to watch it again to say it's was a masterpiece. I didn't go away saying ahhhhhhh.... Or really felt emotional connected to Officer K, or Deckard. I was more connected to the AI than these characters. But visually, music and acting was on point except the CGI crap. I would give it 8.5/10. And the original blade runner is 9.5. I hope the next Blade Runner they work on developing the Characters better and relationships so I can feel emotionally connected, less CGI, and a stronger Plot.",1
126,"For me it is the best movie from the artistic side - artistic masterpiece, arcydzieło. The music, sound design, shots, the play of lights.. 10 out of 10. The story might feel a bit straightforward at the beginning, but.. only at the beginning. Then the truth hits your face and you feel lost for a moment or two. Nice twist, perfectly done! I heard voices in the cinema that ppl lost the track or that it was to heavy for them.. It wasn't that hard to understand all the leads if you paid attention to the details. So keep the eyes and ears open ;)",1
127,"First of all I must say the original movie is my favorite movie of all times. That said, and taking into account the expectations I had over the movie I must say it is a remarkable film.Its pacing is similar to the original and not even closer to what the trailer let us thought would be a frenetic action film.Plot is deep and well led by the main mystery which I found unexpected and very well-chosen. And the cast performs really well, special mention to Ryan Gosling and its character.There is not doubt the movie is visually impeccable, however I had opposed feelings about it. I found it not to be exactly faithful to the original with too much light in general and partially losing the retro aspect of the original.The sound was OK, but far away from the greatness of the original and you can easily notice it when a piece of the 82's movie sounds in the new film.I cannot say if new audiences will like it, but for those who already knew Blade Runner it will be at least a decent sequel.",1
128,"One of the best films i have seen in a long time. This film takes the concepts of the first film and expands on them beautifully. The cinematography is awesome making every scene a feast for the eyes. The soundtrack accompanies this marvelously, at times invading your personal space. It was also nice to hear some of the original soundtrack included in the film. I would recommend this film to anyone, including people who did not enjoy the first one (although you really should watch the first before viewing).",1
129,"It is not easy to pick up a movie like BR to try and make a sequel. Use the interminable Hollywood tropes that almost every movie uses these days and you'll lose the adult crowd. Slow it down, like BR 2049, and you lose the attention span deficit youth. Stay too close to the original and the sequel becomes redundant. Diverge too much and it alienates fans of the original.And indeed BR 2049 manages to somehow fall into all of these traps of sequel-making. It ends up as a sort of stew of Hollywood tropes, like the inevitable female Terminator in this movie, and artsy scenography in lieu of world building. Low clouds, rain and plenty of top down shots get rid of the need for convincing visual detail of the sort found in the original. And that gives us plenty of time for intellectualist masturbation over contemporary politics in what was supposed to be a movie representation of Gogol's Dead Souls.But thanks to the American invasion of the planet it is of course now impossible to talk about slavery without immediately ending up in a squabble over racism. But these are two completely separate issues, which you can spend the rest of your life without being able to explain to an American. And then you can't understand either Gogol or Blade Runner.And I'm not sure if the people who wrote BR 2049 understand it either. Having said that though, this is a good movie. But it is a bit long and very quiet in places. I was tired when I came into the theater and really struggled staying awake in the middle of it. Luckily something exploded loudly just as I was dozing off and I was able to stay conscious for the ending. But there needs to be a reason for a movie to be close to three hours long. And I'm not sure if I see it. Some trimming in editing, some work on the script to make it coherent with the original and some careful chiseling of some of the more heavy handed characterizations would not have been time wasted. But it is what it is. But if I have to see one more unrealistic ninja woman with glasses in a movie I might just go live in a monastery.One thing that annoys me terribly is that Decker could not have been alive after thirty years if he was a replicant. This is the key theme in BR, which hints very strongly that he is in fact a replicant. And if he isn't a replicant there should be little need for him to hide in BR 2049. It was obviously more important to give Ford his cameo though, and narrative cohesion be damned! Why can't the people writing the script at least be made to carefully watch and truly understand the movie they are rebooting. This crew did the same thing with Alien Covenant. Fortunately BR 2049 is a million times better than that disaster though. Good call to keep Ridley Scott as far away from this movie as humanly possible.",1
130,"This is a well-made film. I really didn't like the first one, but I liked this. It was engrossing and visually stunning. And I like that's it's not just an action, action, action thing all the time. It has a story that's served well by slowing down at times. The female ""bad guy"" I thought could be quite over-the-top, but I liked all the other actors.",1
131,+Visuals+Acting+ScriptFilm was fantastic and is a great sequel to one of my all time favorite films.  Cannot wait for the Blu-Ray to come out.,1
132,A beautiful sci-fi movie and a fantastic addition to the genre. The movie has outstanding colour use and cinematography. Also is able to tell a complex story with twists. Without rubbing it in the audience's face we all get the story. The movie is also not afraid of the long shot with no interruptions. I recommend seeing this movie.,1
133,"My personal favourite movie of 2017. Such a travesty that not more people watched it, while the awful new Star Wars has ton of people watching it, even though it's quite ****If you like well planned, thought through and executed stories, interesting characters with personality and the scifi/cyberpunk setting, then this movie doesn't disappoint.",1
134,A beautifully shot film. The story is carefully crafted and realistic. The cinematography and music are terrific and they work well together to deliver a truly immersive film despite its long runtime. It deals with issues similar to the first film and is a great addition that not only expands the blade runner universe but also keeps the sense of mystery surrounding that world.,1
136,"An auditory & visual masterpiece that stays true to the original film whilst also feeling suitably futuristic and nuanced in a number of different ways. I did feel it was a little too ponderous at times, but this is still a seriously mesmerising sequel from Villeneuve.",1
137,"A beautifully crafted slow-burner that expands the world of the previous film, respectfully acknowledging the 1982 film while carving out a path of it's own. Thankfully, 2049 is a superior sequel, managing even out all of the issues with the previous film and turn it into something more substantive.",1
138,"All in I went in with very low expectations and a wondering of why.  I sat for three hours without a beverage or snack and did not miss it at all.  The pacing is slow and methodical.  The dialogue is drawn out.  These are things I do not see as a bad thing at all.  That is the tension.  The whole point of the movie is finding and understanding your place.  Only way to so that properly is slowly. I felt like I was along for the ride. Visuals are top notch.  Oddly I find the soundtrack to be phenomenal.  It is not catchy, nor can I remember a note however it is edgy and fits the tone of the movie accurately.  That is what music is supposed to do.  I would say its not for everyone. I would say that if you don't like it I get it.  Great movie. Perfect villain.  Wallace is exactly what I would expect a megalomaniac to be.  Can not wait to see it a third time.",1
139,If you liked the first film then you will really enjoy this film.  Honestly this movie feels exactly like the original film.  That blending of the old style with the new makes this an any enjoyable film for any movie lover.,1
140,"Mr. Ridley Scott. I was betrayed the Effing Covenant. However, this movie is good Sequel of blade runner. You get impressed me Again. I saw you again.",1
141,"One of the best movies in this century. Definitely the most beautiful movie ever made. It was just as I expected it to be. Slow paced with brilliant scenes of action and they gave us some answers to the questions from the first movie, but there is also some new mysteries now. Has the spirit of the first movie and I like that. Of course, it is not for everyone, especially for those with weak minds who are looking for constant action sequences.",1
142,"The running time of the Blade Runner 2049 movie is 2hrs37mins. Arguably, it’s a daunting commitment for any potential viewer. You might go thinking: ‘Ah, that means the tempo’s slow and it’s overly-long or self-indulgent.’ Rest assured, however, that when you are occupied watching awe-inspiring visuals and listening to an intriguing soundscape, you simply don’t notice the time passing. And there’s a decent detective story with tantalising clues, a multi-layered plot and exciting conflicts thrown in as well. This film truly has the lot.The director is Denis Villeneuve, who also made the award-winning SF flick Arrival. He recaptures the vision of the future we see in the original Blade Runner and then builds upon it, with fine world-building (enough for a third movie, without doubt) and his own original ideas. He is also a skilled, light-touch story-teller. There is nothing clumsy or clunky in Blade Runner 2049. It is all subtlety, allusion and some playful confusion. Such an approach would make for a frustrating watch with certain directors, but Villeneuve makes sure to deliver on revelations and to resolve every aspect of what is going on. It’s masterfully done.The story? Well, the cyborgs/androids of the first movie have been replaced by a new series of much-more-obedient AIs. These AIs each has an artificial ‘childhood memory’ implanted into them so that they can react in a more human way to day-to-day life, and so that they can react with a certain personality. We follow one AI detective (played skillfully by Ryan Gosling) who comes to suspect that his memory is real and holds clues to the mystery with which he has been tasked by his boss (the ever-wonderful Robin Wright). Chuck in an evil tech corporation (with a sick boss and terrifying henchwoman) and we have everything we need for a dark and glorious tale. And it’s no secret that Harrison Ford is in the movie: he’s not wasted either; his ‘own’ story is really moved on by 2049… In fact, 2049 sorts out all the plot holes of the original film, which I would never have thought possible.And here’s the kicker. I was never the biggest fan of the original Blade Runner, either when I saw it as a 15yrold at the cinema, or as a 40-year-old who assumed that all the ‘fuss’ about this ‘cult’ movie meant his youthful self must have missed something. I just thought of the original as a fairly predictable, clumsy and derivative SF flop (it wasn’t any Star Wars!).  Yet Blade Runner 2049 has stood everything on its head. It’s almost as if my childhood memory is an artificial one, one that had been implanted to give me character. It’s as if my program has now been rewritten and I am born again. And that’s my last point about the movie: it has an eerie familiarity to it that makes it truly prescient and uncanny. It is a vision of what is most assuredly going to happen to our species. It has the power of prophecy. And so… I can only score this movie 10 out of 10 (a first for me).",1
143,"It's an absolute travesty that this movie is a box office bust, but this will definitely be a cult classic like the first Blade Runner.  The cinematography and world-building in this movie is unbelievably amazing.  It's a 2 hr 43 minute movie that was completely enjoyable the whole time.  Great story, great action, great acting, and really does a great job asking the audience what it really means to be human.  My favorite movie this year and I would recommend it to everyone.",1
144,"There is one constant connecting the few naysayers among the critics of Blade Runner 2049: They all sound surprisingly like the naysayers of the original. I remember watching the original and loving it, even though many critics panned it in the same way that a few are doing now. The only real difference is that while a majority of critics at first panned the original and then slowly changed their minds, this time most critics get what Blade Runner is all about and are appreciating it from the get-go, while a paltry few, some of whom didn't like the original either, are panning it for much the same reasons the original was panned: It's too obscure, it's a mood piece that doesn't really hold up as a story, it's too long, it's more a series of set pieces than an engaging drama, etc. Well, guess what naysayers, the majority don't care, and all you've done is miss the point and distance yourselves from having a great movie experience. And given time, this Blade Runner, like the original, will grow an audience, beyond it's critics and even it's fan base. Thats what this kind of film does - it comes on like a slow acting drug, that wallops us in the beginning, then slowly drags us to a new place, and finally sinks in, long after we think we are done with it. The seeds that it plants in our psyche will eventually grow into our subconscious, where we will find ourselves having feelings about the film that we didn't have at first viewing. But for some, the seeds will never germinate and they will be left with nothing to show but a feeling of 'what was that all about?' While for those of us whose seeds do grow, a feeling of quiet awe and understanding will begin to take shape. And, if we haven't seen it already, we will begin to see that Blade Runner is most importantly about our inability to ever fully know who we really are and what this drama we are living is really all about. It also shows us a vision of a possible future, that we may already be on our way to creating - a future where love, the most basic emotion of all, like the trees that no longer grow in 2049, finds it hard to find a place to grow. And yet, like the small flowers that Joe finds at the foot of the dead tree where Rachel is buried, love still finds a way to survive.And finally, eyeball to eyeball, that was and is the first image in both films and the point of the whole thing. Voigt-comp, the ultimate test of who is human and who is not. Technology, testing, and can the test be fool proof, or are we just fooling ourselves into believing that our testing really proves anything? Human or AI? What will be the ultimate difference, how will we tell the difference, and will it even matter when the replicants and AI decide not to take it anymore and then take their place on the evolutionary ladder. Next up, replicant revolution, AI liberation, and the subservience of the human genome to a future where the world is reborn, and love, the one ingredient that cannot be altered or done away with, is still at the heart of existence.",1
145,"I cautiously got excited to see this movie.  Of course, I watched the Final cut version of Blade Runner with my son 2 days before.  My anticipation increased when I saw overwhelming critic ratings, but I only read one review ahead of time.  I was worried that too high expectations would result in my being disappointed with the film.  I did note that the film was 2 hrs and 40 minutes long so I prepared myself for a long movie.  The obvious place to see this film was the IMAX at the MN zoo which has a true 70 mm screen (97 ft high!!!) and the most awesome sound presentation that I have ever heard.I'm happy to say that I was not let down by my high expectations.  I loved the story, visuals and sound track of Blade Runner 2049!  The movie plays like a mystery/detective story and keeps the audience immersed and thinking about what they are watching.  This movie may not be for everyone since there are many scenes with no talking as it follows the protagonist, detective K (played well by Ryan Gosling), while he works the clues and moves around the futuristic world.  Just sit back and enjoy the visuals and music score during these scenes.  It is so nice to see a movie that is built around an intricate story with character development and not just how many chase scenes they can string together.  Hollywood are you listening???  Blade Runner 2049 does a great job stitching the special effects into the movie to complement the story rather than vice versa.  Be sure to watch the original Blade Runner before going to see this movie.  The stories are linked and you will be doing yourself a disservice otherwise.",1
146,"Stunning, immersive, thrilling. A special mention deserves the photografy, colors, music and sound effects, which creates a wonderful sense of immersion. The story is surely more complex and rich compared to the first one (it has more twists and complexity). I was amazed and captivated till the end of the movie.",1
147,"I’m not sure, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this film taken a lot of inspiration from Baraka and Ghost in the Shell (1995).Both films in my opinion, are perfect, for what they intended to aim, but they can be very straining for most viewers because it felt slow or confusing to watch. And both these films were barely an hour long.This film very similar to these except, it has double the length time. And that can be straining for even really patient audiences.Not for everyone, but to those who want to be immersed into such a well thought out, beautiful world, it’ll be up your ally.This film needed better editing, especially at around the last 45 min mark though.Really nice surprise! 8.9/10",1
148,"A phenomenal movie that left me completely stunned and wanting to watch it again almost immediately. As was the case with the original, the themes explored within are immediately impressive but also promise to reward the viewer who revisits the story again and again. Masterpiece.",1
149,"This movie is the definition of perfect art in cinematography. It makes you wonder and interpret its content on so many levels. It's well balanced, stunningly beautiful, atmospheric. A perfect sci-fi thirller. One of the very few movies I could watch many times. It's a must watch for all open minds. Who knows maybe that's how our future will look like in 30 years...",1
150,"Quite easily one of the best films I've ever watched. The visuals, the acting, the world, the story, THE MUSIC is all great. The themes the film focuses on really interested me and it had my full attention. Please if you're watching this movie do not expect an action movie because I will guarantee you will dislike it otherwise. This film is one where you have to really pay attention to the film, to understand it's themes, it's characters and the world it is representing. It is honestly disappointing for a film like this to not be appreciated enough at the box office. I don't want to spoil the film, so go watch this! (Also I would recommend watching the original Blade Runner and the three shorts, Blade Runner 2022, Blade Runner 2036 and Blade Runner 2048 prior to watching this film, to enhance your experience).",1
151,A visual masterpiece. Maybe one of the best movies of the 2000s. The story stands on it's own but having watched the first movie helps. Ryan Gosling is perfect for his role and Harrison Ford is not back just for a paycheck and a cameo. The soundtrack is more or less the same as the first movie and it ties in perfectly to the world created. Overall a must watch.,1
152,Wow! This movie was amazing. Thoroughly entertained throughout. I would go so far as to say this is a rare example of a sequel that supersedes that of it's predecessor. BR:2049 paints the perfect picture of a dystopian future. The story is compelling and really draws you in. I don't have one bad thing to say about it. Go see it!,1
153,"Interesting movie, but about 30 - 40 minutes too long.  It simply couldn't maintain its momentum.  That said, I think it's a true sequel to the original, for which I also had pacing issues.  If you're a sci-fi buff like me, definitely worth a watch in theaters.  Otherwise, wait for home release.",1
154,"A great Villeneuve´s film that evidences a much bigger film that is the original Blade Runner. I have rarely had the opportunity to witness a sequence that both explains and enhances its predecessor. Hollywood in its anxiety to make sequels and copies that guarantee box office successes could learn from 2049, Copolla's ""The Godfather Part II"" or Irvin Kershner´s ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and experience more undiluted and better content ""Parts II"" or ""Episodes VII"", for example. 2049 teaches us that you can be ""fruit and original"", to be ""part and principle"" where all the best sequences of the film, design and music are an homage to everything we learned from Ridleys Scott´s Blade Runner. After all, even in 2049, the apple must does not fall far from the tree.",1
155,The film burns slow but burns deep. The cinematography and set production is unlike any movie I've seen all year. It displays quiet power that draws you and doesn't let go. It's an art film with a big budget.,1
156,One of the best movie I've seen in my entire life. I loved the first movie and I adore this one as well. I just think they are both fantastic and both are the best cyberpunk movies of all time.,1
157,"the CGI in the movie is perfect, the vilain is terrible because he nearly doesnt appear, the story is really well build and makes you intrested the whole movie. rian gosling is great as K in the movie, but the movie is a little too long, sometimes the director Denis Villenuve take  a long time to make something quick, but the movie is great",1
158,"After my first view of this film, I felt it was more style over substance, but upon second viewing I realized I was wrong and there is plenty of substance beneath waiting to be uncovered with multiple viewings.  If you're a fan of the original Blade Runner, you'll love this film.  If you aren't, as I wasn't a big fan of it, I loved it as a film on its own and it brought more depth and meaning when I went back and viewed the original after seeing this.  This is the rare sequel that supersedes the original; think Godfather: Part II or The Dark Knight.",1
159,"A lot of people complain about the slow plot. Well, the first Blade Runner had a slow almost non-existent main plot: Deckard hunts for some replicants. What made it a great movie was the atmosphere, visuals, and philosophical implications. The movie conveyed exactly the same feeling like the original Blade Runner. The thing is, cinematic techniques evolved. A movie carbon copy of Blade Runner released today won't give the same feeling like back then. And it's amazing Dennis managed to capture that feeling with this sequel. He truly is a master of the craftWhile seemingly the film lacked a final ""The C-Beams Speech"", it actually didn't, because it started with one, ""never witness a miracle""The movie is great. It's slow, but I loved it this way, because a fast movie will make all the visual go to waste. Just don't watch it tired or as an action flick. While the plot line is not his strongest point (neither was the first's movie) it's still engaging, fresh and it doesn't keep you bored. Enjoy the movie as it should: a visual experience",1
160,"It's sci-fi brought to perfection, every aspect of the movie was made to honor the prequel while at the same time stand on it's own, the plot is a modern day 80's detectivesque movie, Gosling plays the role the the audience has, someone that knows what has transpired bot doesn't exactly knows how that affects his surroundings, and work his way to discover one of the most deep, solid and human stories that cinematography has to offer, and a classic that is a worthy succesor, a great movie on it's own, and an even better succesor",1
161,It's fitting that the film has divided audiences the way it has. Seems appropriate to the Blade Runner mythos. I think its achievements swamp its weaknesses. This is an immediate classic and at least the equal to its predecessor.,1
162,"We saw the original in '82, fell in love with everything about it. It shaped our family's aesthetic in many ways, and predicted so many changes in society's relation with technology. The sequel is a gift, a treat, a miracle. Such a beautiful film, will go see it again next week.",1
163,Music and visuals are incredible. The story is good enough. It's long but not unnecessarily drawn out. The length allows it to become immersive. See it in a good imax for added bonus because this movie at top volume is great.,1
164,"Blade Runner 2049 is awesome!This film clearly respects its predecessor in each and every way and unlike recent bland sequels or reboots, it really stands on it's own.",1
165,"One of the best movies of recent years. Brilliant continuation and spectacular science fiction movie. Amazing pictures, great acting and special effects. Everything is delightful and beautiful. The directorial skills on high level. I waited for this movie many years.",1
166,"The short review: This sci-fi, action thriller is a great film, visually, sound-wise, story-wise and acting-wise. Think Dunkirk (2017) but with a great story.> Related media: It is a sequel to 1982's Blade Runner, which was itself based on the novel 'Do androids dream of electric sheep?'. That original film has a novel based on it and three other sequel novels. I have not seen nor read any of them, but I have heard a lot about the film and I know its story, generally.> What's it like?: It borrows the dystopian style of the original film and tells the story of a new LAPD blade runner (officer tasked with killing rogue replicants) named K, who is himself, a replicant (artificially-built humans). His job and investigation leads him to discover more about himself and about a major secret about the replicants.> Pros: > 1) It has great visual- and audio-styles and great visual- and audio-effects. I look forward to it winning many major awards. > 2) The story, script and acting are also great and there are some awards possible there too. This film is directed by Denis Villeneuve not Ridley Scott, and considering the latter's recent films, that's a good thing. > 3) The film presents many interesting futuristic things. > Cons: > 1. It may be able to lose some 15 minutes by speeding up some parts slowed down unnecessarily for artistic reasons. > How would the the different age groups rate it?Children: (not rated for children)Teens: Average (It's probably a bit too complex and slow for the general teen.)Young adults: ExcellentMedium age adults: ExcellentOld adults: Good > Rating: 5/5 (no half scores). Pay to watch it in the cinema and then buy the DVD.",1
167,"There is nothing that Denis Villeneuve has done wrong lately, after his hits with Sicario and Arrival, comes the sequel to one of the most beloved cult films in all of film history. Visually it is majestic, the visual effects, the photography, the design of production and even the costumes are great executions. Ryan Gosling embodies well in bad roles like Drive, and in this is no exception, he stays to perfection. Maybe not be better than the first movie, but handles other issues, so that good work of the screenwriter.",1
168,"A near perfect movie that misses a few key notes but makes up for it in other ways. Everyone feared that this movie would be a pointless sequel but somehow the crew succeeded at allowing it to breathe on its own and in many way surpass the original. The world of Blade Runner isn't a world where one man, or replicant, can save the entire world. In fact, it addresses the genre in asking whether or not that is even necessary of the hero of your story, never mind whether it is necessary for a being to be considered ""human."" K is Joe because he wants to be Joe. K chooses a small act of kindness over saving the future of his race because that is the connection he values more. There is so much to unpack from this film. Did Joi actually love K or was she simply a program telling him what he wanted? Was she an example of the fake and how close it can be to the real? Or were all the women in the film interested in K an example of the fake, in terms of the ""human"" connection  so desperately wanted.Some issues could have been fixed before release, the cinematography was perfect, but the soundtrack by Zimmer doesn't even come close to matching the perfection of the original soundtrack by Vangelis. Additionally the flashbacks seemed out of place for a Blade Runner movie, but as a Villeneuve staple it was probably to be expected. If I can make one recommendation to a person who loves film, it would be to watch this movie, and to think about it.",1
169,"Cyberpunk perfection right there. Absolutely everything about this movie was perfect, amazing script, amazing soundtrack, amazing universe. Absolutely bloody brilliant, this is Triple SSS tier cyberpunk and I highly recommend it",1
170,"A little under a year ago, I declared Denis Villeneuve to be my favorite modern director in my review of Arrival. Now, with Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve confirms my assertion and furthers my belief that Roger Deakins is the best modern cinematographer. Put the two together and poetic, thoughtful, and visual magic happens. Blade Runner 2049 is the perfect embodiment of this with the two combining to bring forth a film that stands as one of the best of 2017 to date. Gorgeous, thoughtful, and brilliantly unraveling at a methodical-but-not-slow pace, Blade Runner 2049 is a film that makes me want to revisit the original, after having absolutely loathed it three years ago (I saw the Final Cut so do not even bring up the different cuts). Now, as my own journey through cinema alters, I am in a position to enjoy and bask in the glory that is Blade Runner with 2049, Villeneuve, and Deakins, being the gateway. Blending Tarkovsky influences, Tarkovsky religion, and the story of Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049 is a thought-provoking work that goes well beyond the essential question of; are replicants equal and deserve to live or are they sub-human?That said, the philosophy and ideas certainly take a backseat to the work of Roger Deakins. Watching Blade Runner 2049 is akin to being able to watch a painter work on his masterpiece, marrying warm oranges with cold blues, hues of pink, and shades of green, all in the name of creating a smorgasbord of beauty that stands as a testament to both the skill of Deakins in shooting a film and his ability to use color to tell a story. In terms of just the visuals themselves, however, the gorgeous reliance on silhouettes as Agent K (Ryan Gosling) walks out of white, billowing smoke and as Agent K walks through the orange wasteland that is Las Vegas, demonstrate some of this beauty. As do shots of Gosling walks through the cold blues and greens of Los Angeles, the dark ships flying through the orange air of Vegas, the white light of a ship with orange taillights against the dark black sky, the shot of a dog staring into the distance as its master is gone, a fire burning bright orange in the dark of the night, a blind man walking out of the shadows into the orangeish hue of temple, a car pulling into a snowy and green-walled parking garage with its red brakes beaming off the ground, and a glowing pink hologram with blue hair bending over to talk to Agent K and bringing with her the pink radiance surrounding her and blending it with the dark blue aura about him. This is a film with no shot out of place, no moment that is not striking, and more than anything else, this is a testament to Deakins. Turning colors into a visual mosaic of mastery and the simple beauty of the colors themselves, Blade Runner 2049 - before the year is even over - is the most visually stunning work of 2017. There can is no debate. Few films paint such a brilliant picture that words seem to fall short of truly expressing.Perhaps one of the greatest displays of the film's brilliant visuals comes in how it uses the colors within its palette and also its locales/sets. As an agent for the Los Angeles Police Department, Agent K is tasked with hunting down replicants. He himself was synthetically made, but is a model who cannot rebel and made after the blackout, thus, is tasked with killing replicants who may still wish to rebel. While fully obedient, he is nonetheless an outsider. At home, he finds his front door has been vandalized to say ""Die Skinner"". Prostitutes are wary of him due to his status as a Blade Runner. The only one who accepts him is Joi (Ana de Armas), who is girlfriend and also a hologram made as a companion for him. As he walks the streets of Los Angeles, it is constantly raining or snowing with cold blues, greens, and purples, abounding through the streets. At work, the walls are flat white and his own demeanor his cold and repressed. Joi brings him joy, but limited given the fact that she is not real and they cannot touch. His existence is one that sees him kill replicants, who he feels a connection to, but he does as he is told. For Agent K, his life is one of coldness and repression. As such, his environment embodies exactly this. Cold and unwelcoming, the cold colors found in Los Angeles define Agent K as a man who lives on the outside. This is not his home, nor is he welcome in Los Angeles. He is a man in a foreign land with no fire to warm his chilly exterior.By direct contrast, Agent K finally finds his people and his cause in Las Vegas. As a post-apocalyptic and radioactive city, Las Vegas is covered in a thick haze that is turned a burnt orange due to the orange, burned out sky above. Left behind as Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is whisked away by Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), Agent K finds himself surrounded by replicants. Taken to the underground compound, surrounded by those like himself, and a warm orange fire, Agent K has finally found where he is meant to be.",1
171,"The movie might be a bit too long for some people, and there's definitely a lot to take in while watching this movie. Blade Runner 2049 is a great sequel, and very faithful to the original. The movie is absolutely gorgeous, every scene is like a piece of art. Surprisingly, I was never bored with the movie thanks to the captivating dialogues and great acting from the cast.",1
172,"Masterpiece. All those involved in realising Blade Runner 2049's construction - from the direction, writing, and aesthetic(s) (including the soundscape), to the cinematography, editing and acting - are (surely?!) operating within the upper echelon of film art/design. Thematically profound,  visually stunning, and tonally aligned with its predecessor.",1
173,"Je reviens du cinéma où j’ai vu, à mon avis, l’un des meilleurs films de cette année : Blade Runner 2049. C’est une suite qui respecte beaucoup le style visuel et narratif du premier tome de 1982. Blade Runner 2049 est une expérience riche tant et si bien que j’ai eut l’impression d’écouter de la musique classique, mais en regardant un écran. Denis Villeneuve ne se contente pas simplement de raconter une histoire en présentant une série de plans rapides, mais il prend le temps de partager le moment tel que vécu par les personnages. Il explore les différentes perspectives d’une scène afin d’accentuer son impact. De plus, il stimule notre sens auditif comme moyen mnémonique en référence à d’autres scènes. Je vous encourage grandement à aller voir ce film très bien réalisé. J’ai déjà envie de le revoir. Et il vaut définitivement la pleine de se le procurer sur Blu Ray.",1
174,"This movie is an absolute must watch for every sci-fi fan, and also for the hardcore fans of the first movie! And oh my god the cinematgraphy is just outstanding! A very good and logical sequel with a question even today mankind has to ask!",1
175,"This is the amazing sequel to Blade Runner that we definitely did not deserve. It's better than any Blade Runner sequel I could have imagined. The direction is fantastic, and it might be Dennis Villeneuve's best work to date. The acting is beautiful, and there is not a weak link in the cast. The script is mind blowingly incredible, and very true to the original Blade Runner film.This movie is an experience. You will be transported to this other world and blown away. Watch this movie on the biggest screen that you can, it will only add to how beautiful this movie looks. I spent the rest of the day thinking about life after I walked out of the theater. This movie will inspire you. Go see it.",1
176,"The film tries to impress us with its connection to the original, when in fact it just cannibalizes the Ridley Scott masterpiece for the only value it has. It's just not organically woven into the new film and it's painfully obvious, right down to the 'imitation Vangelis' soundtrack which is so bad it should be illegal. 2049 has no depth and dimension and points to the work of a very mediocre director re-configuring and dispensing the bland expectations of a 21st century sci-fi audience who are so dumbed-down by 21st century schlock by now that they, sadly, can't tell the difference. I had to keep telling myself that the film had nothing to do with the original just to get through, but then I was left with the stark, 2-dimensionality of a truly poor work that relies on its visual effects and darkest themes to anesthetize the audience into believing they actually saw something worthwhile.",0
177,Its a real blessing that the new Bladerunner keeps the old pacing. In a time where all big franchises from star wars to star trek uses only quick action to get the attention of the viewers. I liked the old style of film making which allows the viewer to think about it while watching. In my opinion its one of the best sequels ever made! A must for every scifi fan and a definitely must for Bladrunner fans!,1
178,"From beginning to end, this movie holds your attention. I was a fan of the original, but not a die-hard fan. When I saw this, I was completely blown away. I had incredible expectations for this movie. The character development, narrative, script, editing, cinematography, directing, sets, miniatures, VFX, are just out of this world. A true Sci-Fi masterpiece.",1
179,"Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies of all time, let's start out there, not only it's a great movie; it's also one of the fundamental pieces of science fiction in cinema. Ridley Scott's vision, the images, the music, another legendary role  for Harrison Ford, the cult to the film, everything that encloses the name Blade Runner implies too many things.Now let's take into account a director like Denis Villeneuve who in recent years has been cementing an exceptional career, his last five films have been among the best of cinema in their respective years of release.Now bring those things together in a sequel, a sequel to a movie that many fans consider untouchable, a sequel that comes thirty five years after the original. To say that the expectations were gigantic is to stay too short, not only for everything that represents the original film but for the reputation of its director, but I also realized that it was completely unfair to judge the film for that.But what was of Blade Runner 2049? Honestly? I honestly am very happy about the movie I watched, 2049 is a movie that did not damage the legacy of the original but rather enhances it, a sequel worthy of the name and in my opinion one of the most beautiful films visually speaking in the last decade.I will not reveal anything independently of all those who have already seen it but what I can say that despite the simplicity of the plot in general, this is a coherent and functional story, everything is in place and pretty much works really good. Ryan Gosling as K manages to create an interesting, complicated, deep enough character completely different from what Harrison Ford did. Obviously the difference lies in that K is a replicant, therefore his path is different. The plot follows a simple but profound argumentative line; after all, the repercussions of the events that develop after the discovery of K are enormous and somehow establish what could give rise to another or other films, although it's something I doubt enormously.The themes of 2049 deal with identity, the soul, love, artificiality, evolution, faith, hope and yes in the end talks about revolution, the lesson that is learned and the film belongs to Gosling's character, there should be no doubt about that. Harrison Ford makes his appearance like Deckard but he is not the focus of this movie, although its character has a substantial weight in the plot.Now let's talk about the technical marvel that is 2049, let's start with the visual, **** me, Roger Deakins created something awesome, the shots in their entirety are intoxicating, Blade Runner 2049 is a visual orgasm, I don't have the slightest doubt, I haven't seen another film this year that looks like this one, I must emphasize it, it is ridiculous the visual level of this film and also the sets play a very important role and these are also first class, especially those of the offices of Wallace Corporation and in Las Vegas, that scene in which Ryan Gosling is walking through the sand with that brutal orange palette is beautiful, to hang it in a museum, what else can I say? is just spectacular.Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's score, while it does not live up to what Vangelis did is actually pretty good, coupled with the outstanding sound design and sound effects, the film sounds awesome, I had never felt a movie theater vibrate that way.Now I must speak of the bad things, which is not much but undoubtedly they do have effects in the film, the main one has to do with the way in which certain elements of the plot are carried and the rhythm of the narrative, that has nothing to do with the film's length because even though it lasts almost three hours, the film does not feel overlong at all, it's just that there are slow passages that stop the film a lot and they affect the general fluidity of the narrative.Another problem has to do with the loose ends, the most surprising one has to do with Wallace - Leto's character - because we do not know what the **** happens with him and it's clear that his character has more at stake than what was seen and the way he disappears from the film is rude and unbelievably unsatisfactory. Those are the only reasons why I don't give it a ten but after that threshold, the movie is excellent.Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels in history, as I said it earlier is totally worthy to carry the title and also has the total right to erect itself as a complete and solid work of its own. Another home run for Villeneuve I'm more than ready and excited to see what he will do with Dune.You may not like it; I honestly think it's not for all audiences, especially those who consume mostly or totally commercial films, nothing bad in it but at least if you are going to judge the film, judge it for what it is, no for what you expected.",1
180,"The 1982 film did not impress me, not even the final cut version. It was simply too boring. So I was not excited about 2049. But I found myself glued to nearly every frame. While the cinematography is the main attraction, most of the characters, story, and score were interesting. Great direction and acting. The only things that I was not overly fond of were Leto's character and the last segment of the movie (except the last scene), where it felt out of place compared to the rest of the film. But one of the year's best for me.",1
181,"To keep it simple, Blade Runner 2049 is a visually stunning neo-noir sci-fi film. If you see it in the theater, don't get a drink because the 2 hr and 44 minute run time will surely lead to a mid-movie piss break.Overall the film is moody, heavy, deliberate and did I mention it was long? Ryan Gosling does his typical Ryan Gosling thing where he kind of skulks around with an blank look on his face, but it somehow looks cool. Imagine his character from ""Drive"", but somehow with an even cooler jacket. Harrison Ford continues to do his excellent ""grumpy reprisals"" of classic roles, and he handles this role about as well as he handled Han Solo in ""The Force Awakens"". The plot is solid, but nothing that will blow you away, and the setting of the film along with the soundtrack seem to be what's stuck in your head after viewing instead of the actual events that take place in the film. There's also Robin Wright Penn providing exposition, a hologram waifu, sequel bait, and Dave Bautista. Despite having a massive budget, there is no giant action set-piece scene in the third act, so don't go in expecting one, but to be honest it really wouldn't fit with the tone of this movie. There is however a beautifully crafted scene involving a sinking car that will give you an anxiety attack. Long story short. See this movies in theaters if you can stomach the giant run-time. It's an absolute treat on the eyes and ears, and Gosling and Ford provide excellent performances that prop up an fine but mostly serviceable plot.",1
182,Visually stunning. Lack of context may come about for some who have not seen the original and may not result as an enjoyable experience within terms of storyline. Denis Villeneuve is the next Nolan.,1
183,A direction of art and photography that makes the sequence of Blade Runner seem even more grandiose than its predecessor. Philip K. Dick would be proud of this sequence if he were alive.,1
184,"Utterly amazing! Perfect blend of dystopia and reviviting panoramas, screenplay and atmosphere. If Rutger Hauers character had partaken I had been sublime for me but that would probably mess with the story and the CGI.",1
185,"It's crazy just how much I felt like I was back in the 80s. The tone and feel of the movie so mirrored the original.  But the grandeur and sound (I think this film did some serious damage to speakers in my AMC) are off-the-charts. I love how it rolls out thematically, and it scratches that nostalgic itch with several call-backs.  Yes, it's a little long and certain scenes get stretch out, but wow, were the women roles in this film incredible.  I'll have to see it again.",1
186,"Exquisite. This is a beautifully crafted sequel worthy of the original, with the dystopian universe faithfully recreated and enhanced whilst maintaining the iconic aesthetic of the world. With perhaps the finest score of the year, stunningly sumptuous visuals, and superb cinematography, this is a sensory feast that is best enjoyed in a theatre. Gosling gives his most enigmatic performance to date, and the performances are polished and nuanced throughout. Carefully paced and edited, this takes time to allow poignant moments to breathe, resulting in a very long but satisfying experience. A sublime film. 9.94/10",1
187,"The very surprising fact how this sequel, 35 years later from the original's release, manages to take the things very lovable about its predecessor and make them a lot better for the modern people. The long 35-year wait is finally over. You can go in and out with a hyped face because this sure is going to be a movie you got to see for yourself to feel the real experience.",1
188,I think negative comparisons with the original Blade Runner are unfair and unwarranted because BR2049 is an excellent stand alone movie. A knowledge of the original isn't really necessary {although an understanding of Deckard and Rachel's relationship would help}. Go and see it on the biggest screen you can and prepare to be wowed!,1
189,"I was worried this was going to be another remake. It isn't - its a continuation of the story from the original Blade Runner. This was perhaps the best film I have seen in years.Normally, I only go through the trouble of writing a review if something was REALLY bad or REALLY good. This one was the latter.",1
190,"Blade Runner 2049 is, in my opinion, better than the first movie. The movie, that is almost three hours long, it doesn´t seem like that, in fact, I wanted to last 30 minutes more, at least. Denis Villenueve is proving to the world, that he is one of the best directors working today, with titles like ""Arrival""; now, he has another masterpiece to add to his references. This movie is gorgeous, the visuals are incredible, something that exceeded my expectations. Ryan Gosling does his best performance ever. Harrison Ford is good also, and his presence in the movie is not only for pleasing fans of the first movie, it has a purpose. Some will say that this movie it´s more complicated than the first one, but I don´t think so, in fact, this movie is more easy to digest than the first one. As a note, this would not be pleasent, if you have not seen the first one. In the end, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece, something to not be missed if you love cinema (and if you like the first movie)",1
191,"Totally worth it. Feels like BR, looks like BR, sounds like BR. Yes, there's sequel setup but its subtle and non-invasive to the story. As to the sexism angle, this is an elseworlds setting with non-humans, there are things that look human but aren't.",1
192,"In a world filled with nothing but countless setups for gigantic movie universes (with some of them being great),we finally have a movie that,even if it's a sequel,can FINALLY breath its own fresh air. This is what Blade Runner 2049 feels like. A BIG proof that there is still some cinematic air to breathe (Oh,and that Sony can still live in making movies). Even the fact that it's directed by Denis Villeneuve (the guy behind the intriguing 'Arrival') can tell its authenticity,with a story that won't disappoint the fans,especially if it's a 153-minute movie where you can barely find a moment where the movie gets weak or nonsensical. Aside from the story,everything else is flaw-free. Roger Deakins (13-time Oscar nominated) still manages to make beautiful shots with its cinematography (give the man a Creepin' Oscar!). If actors like Ryan Gosling or Harrison Ford have a long or a short screen-time,it's still works,since they had some terrific performances. All the Special Effects in the movie,just like the story,had its own life,from gigantic holograms to life-like buildings to flying cars (a thing that we're now supposed to have,i guess...) and you could even see the drastic change from 1982 to 2017. The only flaw i have with this movie is the kind of flaw that a movie like Blade Runner has,and that's the pacing. It gets from severe to calm,then gets action-packed all of the sudden. But aside from the 'uncountable' flaw,there's,as i said,nothing else to pinpoint about. If you're a fan of the original,you'll enjoy it at best,but if you're looking for a movie that doesn't act like a comic-book movie or a gigantic set-up movie,this should perfectly do the trick for you. Blade Runner 2049 is astounding and i can't recommend it enough,as it's one of the best movies of 2017 and THE best sequel of all-time. (as if the SW movies and The Dark Knight were strongly weak compared to this)",1
193,"The future of waifu technology is looking bright.(The movie was really fantastic just like the original, but the biggest take away for me was what I mentioned above)",1
194,"BR 2049 continues the story of the replicants and blade runner. It does so by branching new intrigues into the original script and adding dept. The presentation of the future is still a great warning for all of us. The movie has amazing FX and has some actions. But the main effect of this movie is still the atmosphere and partially Vangelis alike music. I say alike, because it's a pale imitation of Vangelis style and the music is sadly not always that great, and become too many times a collection of sound effects. The actors are excellent, even the side characters are interesting. Don't go to that movie if you want an action flick or you are tired. The movie required your attention, even if it's mostly a visual film, the plot can be elaborate enough. Villeneuve did a fascinating movie that will go into the rank of classic, with the original one...no less. The music is maybe the aspect where it seems too loud and lacking variety. I give it a 90%, go see it if you love scifi. Update: At second viewing, I found that it lacked some action in the middle of the movie. The problem is that maybe, for a Blade Runner, he didn't do much of it in the movie (except at the beginning). Also many scenes linger too much, and it slow down the pace when they come in succession. But if you approach this as a detective movie, it kind of fits better. Still think it's a good movie.",1
195,"A sequel to the cult classic Blade Runner 1982. We live in a world where movie sequels, prequels and remakes plague our cinemas. It's exhausting to read about yet another sequel set 20+ years after the original. In the case of Blade Runner it's 35 years later, a definite risk and rarely pays off but we need not have worried. I'll start by saying I was never a huge fan of the original Blade Runner, for some reason I never got caught up in the hype and I feel almost the same towards Blade Runner 2049. It's great, visually spectacular and I enjoyed it but at the same time I wasn't exactly blown away by it. Yet this is a movie that shows you just how a sequel should be made. Well done Denis Villeneuve you've done something many people thought impossible, you've kept the fanboys happy whilst bringing in a new generation of fans all while keeping true to Blade Runner.I won't say too much about the story, the less you know the better. Ryan Gosling stars as a young Blade Runner who tracks down former Blade Runner Harrison Ford. It's stunning just to watch, the attention to detail in every shot is mesmerizing. Chances are you probably won't see a more beautiful movie this year. Each scene seems to linger, not wanting to move on, allowing you to immerse yourself in this beautiful world. Not only is it hypnotic to look at but it's accompanied by that incredible soundtrack we know so well. Only on a grander scale, it certainly doesn't hold back. The acting is superb, Gosling and Ford make a great team. Poor Jared Leto can't catch a break these days. His character seemed grossly underused and honestly very wasted. Yet considering the much talked about running time of 163 minutes I don't know how this could have happened. Disappointing to see but I'll get over it.A sequel that not only stays true to the original content but brings it to a whole new level. A definite recommendation for all you sci-fi fans and a must see for the Blade Runner fans.",1
196,"perfect cinematography, perfect CGI, perfect acting, good story. Perfect metaphors, thought provoking ideas. Best SCI FI of this decade EASILY. enjoyed nearly every single scene, as it was mastered to perfection. Whatever you do WATCH IT IN IMAX. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL VISUALLY, AND AUDIO WISE I WAS ABOUT TO CRY. MAKES DUNKIRK look like a pile of ash.",1
197,The film is a simple deep complex poetic masterpiece. Blade Runner 2049 does a perfect job of expanding on the brilliantly sewn seeds that were planted in the original 1982 Blade Runner. Before watching it we recommend you revisit the first and even read analysis online to get into the juicy juice. Blade Runner 2049 was made for those who are familiar with the storyline and is a sci-fi monument and masterpiece. Whatever you do — forget about the reviews! One of the ones to stay away from is written by RICHARD LAWSON From Variety magazine. The following was a headline from another article he wrote: “Who Is America’s Most Envied Kardashian-Jenner? We finally have an answer to this most serious of questions.” Well Richard go back to your social media and most serious questions with the Kardashians.,1
198,"I have to admit I wasn't asking for a Blade Runner sequel, and when I heard they were doing one my expectations were rock bottom.  I was pleasantly surprised and I enjoyed it.  I appreciate how the story was simple, there was more focus on visuals and 'showing' rather than explaining and talking.  I got sucked in to the movie and forgot about reality for 146 minutes which was nice.",1
199,"First time I saw the original Blade Runner (“2019”), I just stayed in my seat at the theater until the next showing and watched it again. I taped the movie at the theater to have the soundtrack, whose official version wasn’t released for years. These facts put me in a 0.1% slice of fans of the movie.So what to say of Blade Runner 2049 (“2049”)?2019 pulled you into a world and a mood. The opening scene of Los Angeles in 2019  is not matched in 2049.Making a virtue of necessity, Ridley Scott set 2019 at night (except for the controversial ending scene), which is cheaper to convey in the grimly grand manner he sought. Denis Villeneuve had the budget to venture into the day, which pays off best at the end, with the rest resting in an uneasy truce with sepia. The plot of 2019 was pedestrian; I think a Harrison Ford quote can be found that he played a detective who did not detect much. The plot of 2049 is hardly elaborate, but is more developed and satisfactory. Gosling is a god, and 2019 fans owe him a great debt for his embrace of the project despite the cult. 2019 actually aspired to the epic more in portrayal than in theme. 2049 has greater pretense to the epic—I spoil nothing, just watch the trailer (“the world is built on a wall that separates kind”). 2049 settles for less, but less ends up more. 2049 has a cracker jack supporting cast, although none delivers a line like Rutger Hauer’s “tears in the rain” from 2019. That’s what makes magic magic.I’m glad that age and 2019’s cult status brought Harrison Ford back to the wisdom of his original choice to play Deckard. Sometimes you don’t give your younger self enough credit. Score honored the original, and sound generally was solid.In sum, the army assembled by the hope of a reprise captures the prize of a wonderfully worthy movie in its own right. Doing justice to both 2019 and 2049, you watch no mere sequel. Too long? Perhaps. But better than gone.",1
200,"A fantastic visual spectacle in which the scenes speak stronger than the dialogue, forcing you to think and reflect on the themes touched. The story's focus is indirectly Deckard (Harrison Ford), and the mystery and intrigue of the desolate, emotionless, replicant society where K (Ryan Gosling) operates keeps pushing the story forward towards its climax. Excellent performances by all actors, with Harrison Ford and especially Ana de Armis being the highlights, however I felt that Jared Leto's character Wallace was written to stylistically different from the other characters, and felt out of place compared to everyone else.",1
201,"p«Бегущий по лезвию 2049 »: Снятся ли андроидам достойные сиквелы? В 1982 году, с жанром научной фантастики произошел феномен имя которому Бегущий по лезвию, за авторством сэра Ридли Скотта. Центральной темой фильма были взаимоотношения между репликантами (искусственной формой жизни) и людьми, а так же затрагивалась тема: жизни и смерти. Критики смешано отреагировали на картину и их мнения разделились: кто-то ругал фильм за излишнюю монотонность, а кто-то хвалил визуальную составляющую. В прокате у кинокартины Скотта дела тоже не заладились, где ее ждал провал. И все же, это не помешало «Бегущему по лезвию» выдержать испытание временем и приобрести статус культовой кинокартины. Прошло 30 лет, на большие экраны выходит сиквел, «Бегущий по лезвию 2049» в режиссерском кресле Дени Вильнев, Ридли Скотт значится продюсером, а за сценарий отвечает автор оригинала Хэмптон Финчер. Что же получилось у канадского кинорежиссера? Вильнев не скрывал, что многие элементы в сценарии он переработал под свое видение, при этом развивая основную идею оригинала. Фильм затрагивает тему человечности и поднимает ряд вопросов: что делает человека, человеком? Наличие души? Мораль или может быть эмоции? Вопросы, проходят сквозь сюжет поделенный на 3 акта – ближе к финалу, которого, ожидает Рик Декард 30 лет хранивший тайну способную перевернуть мир. В «Бегущем по Лезвию 2049» окончательно размыта грань между человеком и новыми моделями репликантов, оно и неудивительно ведь главный девиз Tyrell Corporation: ""больше человек, чем сам человек"". Как и в оригинале у картины неспешный темп повествования и большой акцент на деталях, а хронометраж составляет неполные 3 часа. Вообще любая попытка углубления в тему сюжета - спойлер, поэтому детали стоит опустить. Одна из сильнейших сторон фильма – визуальная составляющая, каждый кадр настоящее произведение искусства: его построение, плавность переходов, великолепная работа с цветовой гаммой и неважно будь то урбанистические джунгли дождливого Лос-Анджелеса, усыпанные тысячами неоновых вывесок и голограмм или апокалиптические руины старого города. Роджер Дикинс – настоящий маэстро, в его послужном списке такие работы, как «Побег и Шоушенка», «Старикам тут не место» и 7 номинаций на премию Оскар. «Бегущий по лезвию 2049», образцовый сиквел и значимое событие для современной кинофантастики, в то время пока некоторые студии продолжают штамповать ремейки или продолжения на грани ремейка, Дени Вильнев, снимает свое авторское видение «Бегущего по Лезвию» развивая идеи оригинала, а не эксплуатирует старые. Итог: к просмотру обязательно",1
202,"Superior to the original Blade Runner, and one of the best scifi films for both scifi fans and non-fans alike. I just rewatched the original Blade Runner last night so this is not a comparison based on distant memories. The sequel has a richer but also more approachable and understandable story, better acting and cast, and even better cinematography and music. Must see! Don't be scared away by the weak box office results or long run-time.",1
203,"Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel to the amazing 1982 film, this time directed by Denis Villeneuve. This film was aesthetically outstanding in every way. The costumes were incredible, the sets and set design made you connect so much more with the characters because they felt so real, especially in downtown LA. You could tell a lot of effort went into the different sets, as each one is son unique, from K's (Ryan Gosling's) bedroom to the offices in the LAPD tower to the farm etc. Speaking of Ryan Gosling, he's done another great job in this role. Not once did I doubt he was a Blade Runner, and he effortlessly explorers his characters' subplot (one which I will not elaborate on for obvious reasons), and he just radiated bad-assery. There were a lot of takes with little to no sound/script, and all we had to look at were the amazing sets and emoting of the actors, which was pretty much always impeccable. All the actors and actresses involved did great performances - Harrison Ford slipped back into his role as Rick Deckard just like he was back in the 80's, and the villain(s) were menacing and equally as compelling  as Gosling & Ford. (If it's not obvious already, the cameos of people in the 1982 version were very, very much appreciated!)Probably my favourite aspect was the multitude of different angles and shots that Villeneuve used, as it constantly gave so many different perspectives of the sets and the characters and told the story in a very technical yet beautiful way, which leads me to congratulate the editors on a very good job well done. Not only did they tell the story well, they seamlessly linked flashbacks with the present plot, and often films can suffer from poor/excessive flashbacks, and I am happy to say: this one doesn't.  As for issues, the pacing suffered on a few occasions, and to be perfectly honest I felt the film went on a little too long. There were some long takes (only some, as some were extremely effective) that dragged on a bit, and made me almost wish that it would cut to a different character/scene. Also,even though the sound was outstanding in this film and so sheerly loud, I sometimes felt the music was a little out of place in some scenes. This is probably one of my personal nit-picks, but in a couple of occasions I was like 'why is there music playing right now?' However, when there needed to be music there was, so there weren't scenes where I was asking for it to be added, just a couple where I think it should've been removed, (again, probably a personal thing.) The action scenes were great and well-choreographed, but to be honest I was expecting a few more that there actually was. Conclusion: if you liked the first one, definitely see this one (but I think you'll prefer the first one, I know I did), and even if you haven't seen the first one you should check it out, as it is visually stunning.",1
204,"As someone who loved the original, I'm very happy this movie was made. But I have to say that all the grandeur that this movie is and represents is ruined by one simple thing. Ryan Gosling. Oh yes, he at first seems like the obvious choice for the roll, I see that. Except that he plays the same character in all his movies; a person who expresses nothing. You can shoot him, stab him, kick him square in the balls, and the most you'll ever get as a reaction is that faint, quirky smile he's so known for. Personally, I don't see any difference between his characters, and how he behaves as a person off-camera. And I want to like him. I really do. But when he's put next to any other actor in the film, especially someone like the charismatic Harrison Ford, his brooding sense of quiet falls flat. When they told him he was to play a robot, did he envision something from a 50's sci-fi classic? All he needs are the short jerky movements and some beeps and boops and there it is. And Jared Leto is just as guilty. His calm and cool sociopathic representation of corporate owner just did not bring anything to the performance. Villian 101: you have to almost like them and fall to their charms to truly despise them when they are bad. In this respect, the original still wins out as the better film in my opinion.",1
205,"This is the closest thing we will ever have to a new movie by Andrei Tarkovsky.The slow, deliberate pacing is crucial; it is meditative and entrancing, and the scenes between K and his ""wife"" are thoroughly Lynchian in their drawn-out intense discomfort.I don't want to spoil too much, but there is a gun battle in a special sort of abandoned room - and it just might be the most bizarre, haunting, and perfect scene in Sci-fi cinema since the 1970s.The only things holding me back from giving a perfect 10/10 are that the music, while very good, wasn't as ""Vangelis-ey"" as I would have liked - and that Jared Leto's performance stands out as being very awkward and overwrought in a movie that is otherwise a broiling ocean of wordless emotion and memory.",1
206,"This is a stunning visual masterpiece. An absolute feast for the senses. A true spiritual successor to the original, with an excellent story and script to follow the first pioneer film. I knew going in, it would be a long and slow paced film, and so instead of holding my breath for the climax, I admired and soaked in the amazing world Villeneuve built. Any fan of the original will adore this film.",1
207,"Beautiful, suprising, sad, tragic and timely made. Not as good as first one, but a worthy sequel. First Blade Runner was asking a questions revelant for times it was made. Blade Runner 2049 asks question revelant for times we all live in and the times soon to come.",1
208,"The best movie of the year, Denis Villeneuve is a master of film-making. Ryan Gosling, Ana De Armas, Harrison Ford- all amazing. Roger Deakins deserves an Oscar!",1
209,"A long-awaited (and long-overdue) sequel to a legendary 1982 sci-fi classic that comes ever so close to nailing it save for a few elements that feel decidedly forced and...off. Stylistically beautiful and imaginative, impeccably well acted, and incredibly intelligent in its narrative, the film hits many of the right notes right on the head. It's especially impressive that the film does not place an overreliance on special effects or action sequences to carry the story. However, several unduly intrusive subplots and narrative twists that clearly seem to be aimed at setting up another sequel dilute and impinge upon this otherwise well-crafted story, preventing the film from reaching the true cinematic greatness it could have attained.",1
210,"One of the best movie and the best sequel of this year. Loved so much story, atmosphere, details, cool features with technoligies, new and old characters so much loving, they are awesome, cameos too and visual effects. That's all what I can tell about Blade Runner 2049. If next movie will direct same guy, who directed this movie, I will absolutely go to watch it.",1
211,"A true Blade Runner sequel that shares both the strengths and the flaws of its predecessors. Beautiful cinematography, ambiguous character motivations that leave a lot open to personal interpretation, slow pacing....Yep, that's the ol' Blade Runner. I'd strongly recommend this to any fan of the original film. **IMPORTANT** The film does a poor job of catching newcomers to franchise up on important plot details. It assumes you are familiar with Deckard and Rachel. To appreciate the narrative, you must be at least mildly familiar with the original 1982 Blade Runner film. I'd recommend the Final Cut version of the film. There are also 3 short animated prequels to 2049 that will help you understand the setting more. Strengths: Amazing cinematography, Great acting from the female supporting actresses and Gosling, ambiguous plot that will leave you debating with friends. Weakness: Poorly acted and written antagonist. Narrative is NOT self contained and demands a sequel and some familiarity with previous lore, slow pace.",1
212,Blade Runner 2049 is a great installment to the Blade Runner world. A sequel that stands on its own. You can tell that this film will age well like a bottle of red wine.,1
213,"It is best movie in 2017 year. I want to watch this movie every day. Denis Villeneuve surpassed Scott's original film. Visual effects, acting music, camera work is just the best thing in the film. Harrison Ford is still capable of such films. The music in the film is simply unsurpassed. The film is just 10/10",1
214,"This sequel surpass the original. The dystopian world depicted in the original movie has become even more real, dirty and cruel. This is an instant classic and a film that will send it's director Denis Villeneuve into the Sci-Fi hall of fame. I feared this movie could become a shallow action movie. Luckily I was wrong. This movie has it's own visual language and pace. It also touches on some questions we may have to ask ourselves in the future. This dark and beautiful film is best seen without any prior ideas of what it will contain.",1
215,"This film is a visual masterpiece, and a true feast for the eyes. at 2 hrs 45min you lose track of that extended run time as you become drawn into this brilliantly imagined world that hearkens back to the original with an efficiency unseen in most modern sequels of old films. Denis Villeneuve truly has knocked this movie out of the park and proves he was the perfect choice to take the blade runner reigns. The plot is engrossing and keeps you hooked with every subtle development.This Movie IMO is the single greatest film of the year and is a worthy and respectful sequel to the original film. blade runner 2049 is a refreshing piece of art in sea of rehashed garbage and easily stands above and beyond anything that has come out for awhile.",1
216,"It may not be perfect as it may not be as brilliant as the original picture. Nevertheless ""Blade Runner 2049"" is definetly an amazingly beautiful movie that has a lot of love for it's predecessor. It is seen in all of the aspects of the motion picture starting from soundtrack and camera work ending with characters and storyline. So I must say that the sequel totally deserves being called ""Blade Runner"".I definetly have an infinite amount of respect for Denis Villeneuve for doing such an amazing films, keeping the Balde Runner legacy and cyberpunk genre alive.",1
217,"High-impact movie that transcends the action category and takes you on a hectic journey into identity, memory and belonging. Magnificent photography and composition throughout the film along superb technical effects. On the top of that, world-building is expanded by bold and internally coherent ideas supporting the narrative. Would highly recommend to anyone to see it.",1
218,"Yes, a masterpiece of canon, and style, and production. Spare and sensual, with an extraordinary central performance by Ryan Gosling, great plotting and dialogue in an examination of the nature of love, of memory and of identity. The best of science fiction in that it explores who we really are under almost inconceivable stresses.You can feel the love and effort poured into this movie in every second of film. The music evokes and expands on the original, returns us to this future we know so well from so long ago now.Remember: Science fiction has no ceiling.10 stars.Update:I've just seen Blade Runner 2049 for the third time today. I've never done this before for any movie.Extraordinary. Wonderful. A true masterpiece. Each time I see it, it gets better, deeper, and more profound. The script, direction and performances are flawless.The gentle love scene with the hologram Joi actively blending with the real girl Mariette, matching their movements, to allow Joi to physically express her love for K is exquisite. Astonishing. The best and most extraordinary love scene I've ever experienced in the cinema. I wept.So much of this movie is so profound, so searching and wonderful. The themes of identity, memory, and love are explored with joy and respect. I will see the movie again, in a week or so.",1
219,"With the original film being one of my favorite movies of all time, it was hard for me to believe the sequel could live up to the original.  It does not live up to the original. It equals the original and simultaneously provides a storyline that seamlessly continues the original, 30 years later, while throughout paying 'homage' to the original in so countless subtle ways that blend the two productions together.  Blade Runner is the movie it became thanks to the amazing visuals and the groundbreaking and timeless score by Vangelis which created the Los Angeles of the future in Blade Runner.Blade Runner 2049 blends the original Vangelis sound with strikingly heavy, dark, atmospheric sound.  Think of it as Vangelis blended with Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross' Book of Eli sound, and combine them with subtle hints of the Gravity & Interstellar soundtracks.Exceptionally heavy and chilling and just as Vangelis' original score, creating a future world of undeniable and frightening reality;  and for 2049, the overbearing heaviness of the music during the slow, unfolding scenes throughout the film, especially Sea Wall, provide a stunning depth and impact to the film.  2 hours 43 minutes too long?  Not if you're a fan and looking for another 5 versions.This is the Director's Cut and the storyline is much more profound and creepy once you think about it on your way home.  There a few sequels that stand on their own to the original. This is a masterpiece of special effects, sets, and the storyline sets up BR3 effectively.  It took 35 years for the sequel and it was worth the wait for the right people to come together and create their vision of BR and brilliantly succeed.Worth the wait? Absolutely; and a must see on a big screen with a powerful sound system behind it the first time.As a big fan of the orginal, thank you to everyone involved in the making of this film. It is....an experience.",1
220,"This movie floored me. I love they took the themes of the original, but made their own movie, not a remake acting like a reboot. Acting is great, the look and sound is flawless. Definitely seeing it again this weekend.",1
221,"You’re gonna love it — or hate it. And that’s the best quality I can think of of a movie. It means that Denis Villeneuve made a very personal and thoughtful piece of art.A feast for the eyes AND the ears. Go see this in the theatre next you that have the best sound system. And the biggest screen, of course.Big thumbs up to the cast. (Maybe just one thumb up for Jared Leto and Robin Wright…)You may feel that some scene could have been cut, and you'd be right. Hence, this is not the masterpiece some reviewers are acclaiming, but it's close.",1
222,"Simplemente espectacular, sublime, hermoso. Mi miedo mas grande era que esta película sea puramente acción y nada de trama, menos mal que me equivoque. La historia es bellisima con algunos giros de guion inesperados. No es la pelicula perfecta, tiene algunas incongruencias, pero para durar 3 horas sabe llevar bastante bien toda la traba debido a su ambientacion y trama. Una buena sucesora de la Blade Runner original",1
223,"I'm going to make an analogy. Blade Runner 2049 is to Blade Runner, what Aliens was to Alien. It's quite clear that both Blade Runners happen in the same universe. And I love how this one has several ways of tying back to the original while still being it's own unique vision of such a dystopian future that was originated by Ridley Scott so many years ago. The visuals in this film are a constant mental feast! Each scene is worthy of framing as art and if the cinematographer doesn't receive an Oscar, then no one is worthy of such an accolade. What is so intriguing about this movie is that while it does answer some questions, it actually raises others, especially more-so than the original. That is no easy task for a sequel and one that you will spend days contemplating afterwards. I must also credit the acting here as each character forges their own unique path and one that sends echoes intersecting everyone else. I would not be at all surprised if Harrison Ford receives a nomination considering this is his best performance in, dare I say, at least a decade! Please don't be turned off by the 2hr 43min running time. It felt like 90 minutes to me and it's one of those films that you're sad to see end. For it were possible, I would prefer it go on indefinitely. This is a treasure that MUST be seen in theaters (almost just for the musical score itself!). You will be sad if you don't!",1
224,"8.6/10  Not a Sci/Fi masterpiece overall but definitely an astoundingly incredible spectacle to behold with some of the greatest imagery of all time. Villeneuve has solidified himself as probably the most visually brilliant director around right now with grand scapes of vast meticulous detail. As far as the story goes however there are some unnecessarily lengthy scenes/dialogues/plotting that aim to be far bigger than what they end up being and come off as somewhat pretentious at times. The plotting was exceptionally clever yet just suffered from pacing issues and odd twists that are perplexing yet frustrating. Gosling was fantastic as always, but Jared Leto was once again under utilized and his intriguingly fascinating character was barely extrapolated upon. Zimmer yet again crafted a perfect soundtrack and is an utter master of sonic brilliance.",1
225,"A visually stunning movie with a sci-fi story to match. This sequel answered a lot of questions from Blade Runner 1982 while posing some new ones (so long time BR fans will be pleased). IMHO, this is the most thought provoking sci-fi movie since the first Matrix movie in 1999.",1
226,"Althought I absolutely loved the original Blade Runner, seeing the trailer for the new one I thought that stunnig visuals might be emotionally too distant and that 163 min. might be a bit too long, and that the sequel just cannot catch the magic of the original. My expectations were low,  but the story of 2049 griped me from the very start and it just didn't let go. The styling of the movie – camera, the settings, the costumes and of course most importantly, the actors and the acting are all fantastic. Some stunnig visual scences are absolutely original, e. g. K's interaction with his hologram girlfriend. The engaging narrative is building noir, dystopian vision and the atmosphere that is thought provoking in contemporary highly uncertain global society with rapid technological leaps forward making celebrated, but for general population disturbing innovative disruptions. The rise of AI and its troubled relations with humans is presented well. For me, this film is as an event, movie of outstanding quality, a kind of one in ten years movie. The last so engaging science fiction was the first Matrix movie.",1
227,Wow... go see this movie. Just do it. This is an absolute must for anyone even remotely interested in sci fi or Blade Runner. Holy **** **** please just see it to give money to the studio to encourage more of this in theaters.,1
228,"Blade Runner 2049 is a great neo-noir science fiction epic.Story is set some 30 years after the first movie, with Deckard (Harrison Ford) having disappeared. Replicant ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) is working as a Blade Runner for the LAPD and hunts down older Replicant models to ""retire"" them because they are viewed as a threat to humanity. ""K"" later discovers a truth that might shake the world's foundations, and investigates out of duty and curiosity.The plot is full of surprises and twists. Ford's appearance in the final 3rd of the film is great, but Gosling is the protagonist, his character (even if artificial) is well expanded upon. Blade Runner isn't a film about a hero saving the world, but it tells a human story.The film is also a masterful audiovisual experience no one should miss out on.However not everything is perfect. The ambient soundtrack is mostly majestic but there were times when it was a cacophony and made me mad. The offworld colonies are mentioned in both Blade Runner films but we didn't see anything of them again. Finally there are some minor plot holes and nonsense moments (like in every film), but also a big one with the Revolution.In the end, Blade Runner 2049 is a great sequel. The first Blade Runner, though unique and intriguing, was somewhat underwhelming and it only had the great ""tears in the rain"" monologue in the very end that made it a cult hit. Blade Runner 2049 has no such monumental moment, but it's an overall better (if not perfect) film than the first one.There are talks about a sequel, I'd gladly see more Blade Runner films.",1
229,"Blade Runner 2049 is riveting, magical, tense, transportive, emotional, and so much more. And I'm not just saying that. It gets everything right; from the intricately written plot, to the amazing performances, atmospheric music, lighting, gorgeous cinematography, and set design. Like the original, it makes you get lost in its amazing world. The plot is full of surprises and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll. It stands up equally to the original, but in my opinion takes it even a step further. 2049 has a larger emphasis on humanity, bringing some really amazing heartfelt and emotional moments. It is one of the best films of the year and absolutely needs to be seen with fresh eyes.",1
230,"Speechless. One of the rare case when the sequel is at the same level of the first movie. I passed all the movie breathless due to an engaging story, an awesome photography and dialogues with themes that make us think about our future. Because a future like Blade Runner is closer to what we think.The result is outstanding and I can't find a fault. Perfect.",1
231,"I watched the original multiple times, including studying it as a film covered in a class on cinema, and this one not only: 1. Pays homage to the original; 2. expands intelligently upon the plot and world; 3. (Having brought two friends to see it who HAD NOT seen the original) Is a complete and utter masterpiece as a standalone film in and of itself.10/10 easily, everything was phenomenal, the minor cons are it does plod on a bit too long at times, and Jared Leto had a Jokeresque-short amount of screentime.",1
232,"The original is my favorite film, I should start with that. Is the sequel a masterpiece...no, but I'm more than happy with what I saw (in IMAX). Incredible world-building on par with the original, great casting/characters, award-winning cinematography, great direction, excellent score, and a solid script. I felt it went on a bit too long, and a couple of scenes could be cut, and a few trimmed. But this long run doesn't hurt the film. I really liked it. I'll have to watch it a few dozen more times, and maybe I'll even come to love it as I do the original. Four star film, but I gave it five stars for not screwing up a franchise I thought couldn't possibly be sequel-ed well.",1
233,"The sense of sobriety within the cinematographic language, as used on the 1982 film, remains there and is in my opinion enhanced. It couldn´t fell on better hands than Villeneuve´s, who with his usual shocking and raw depictions of violence (not only physical, but emotional and dark-side-of-the-soul violence), make this film a truly complementary piece for the original Blade Runner; far from an excuse of just doing one. Deakins is the only master of his craft, sound design, original score and production design are exquisite too. Gosling´s performance is heartfelt and complex. Two thumps up for this one!",1
234,"Thirty years after the events of the original film, a new line of replicants was created, more humble and subordinate. The corporation is headed by Mr. Wallace (Jared Leto). Officer LAPD K (Ryan Gosling) learns top-secret information that threatens the existence of the whole world. Trying to find answers to his questions, Kay begins looking for the former ""blade runner"" Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who disappeared without a trace 30 years ago. The extraordinary work of Roger Dickins deserves all sorts of praises and awards (Oscar winner finally?), and Denis Villeneuve continued the film of Sir Ridley Scott with dignity. This is a Denis's own film, which hardly fit into the standard understanding of the sequel. But a very long timing (~2 hours 43 minutes) is able to tire even those who are very pleased with the movie.",1
235,"Best creative direction since Mad Max: Fury Road. Like Mad Max it improves on the world building and aesthetics of the original. Such amazing visuals, soundtrack and direction. If you do not like movies that are a dramatic slow burn (like the original Blade Runner) it will not be for you. Creepy, weird, brooding, dark, and mindbogglingly creative.This is a truly rare science fiction world that the directors and writers take extremely seriously, reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey.",1
236,Well worth it. And quite frankly they managed to keep it true to the original while still being original. This is a movie so worth watching in the big screen for the astonishing sound and breathtaking sci-fi environments. But that is not what the movie is about. It's about characters. Story.,1
237,"A film that definitely matched my expectations but didn't quite exceed them like I had hoped. Nonetheless, this film matches the quality and greatness of the original, and its scope is undeniably large and impressive, especially in terms of the gorgeous visuals and always captivating cinematography from Roger Deakins (seriously, I'll be damned if this film isn't the one to finally get him that far overdue Oscar!) In addition, Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford deliver reliably strong performances! My only gripe is that the film's first act starts out so exciting and promisingly, then slows way down in the middle act, almost too slow if you ask me. I also thought there were quite a few scenes and instances in the middle act that could've easily been trimmed down a bit, and I also noticed that there were a few ideas and moments that felt borrowed from other recent sci-fi films, but then things got back into full gear to deliver a powerhouse final act that ended beautifully, leaving me wanting so much more and making me more than willing to forgive the nearly three-hour runtime. Overall, this should satisfy most fans of the original, as it boasts the visuals, cinematography, magnificent score (well done as always Hans Zimmer!) and thought-provoking themes and symbolism that made the original such a unique and innovative experience! Just beware of the runtime and a middle act that takes it time, but it's well worth it by end!",1
238,It is a technical masterpiece and I cant fault the direction. The script however introduces a lot of elements that are never explored and tied up - and the abrupt ending makes me wonder if this was a directors cut with a lot of unexplored stuff or if it needs a directors cut with 2 more hours of content that will explore all the elements. I wish more time was spent on character development outside of Gosling as well. The pacing and sense of urgency also felt off despite the gravity of what was happening.,1
239,"This movie is a stand out in newer sic fi titles due to the fact that it uses plot, details, and conversations to engage the viewer instead of action as most sic fi films do. While some may say this is the weak point of this film I love this since it just makes the movie even more interesting by introducing and developing character, which I personally find important in a movie for it to be engaging to me. Another part of this film that I loved was the overall aesthetic of the environment, with its futuristic, gloomy California it creates a very iconic setting for the film. The story and cast however are definitely the centerpieces of the film, since the cast was chosen very well to match their characters, and the story is just unimaginably well written in my opinion.",1
240,"I went into this movie with low expectations due to seeing some critic reviews. They couldn't have been more wrong. This was one of the best sequels I've seen... I can't believe how well they got the feel of the original movie right, without just repeating the storyline. And they actually dared to keep the pacing slow... almost unheard of these days in movies. Ryan Gosling was actually amazing... and his character was well-written.",1
241,"Matches the tone, style and philosophical reflections of the original, while clearly advancing the plot, rather than attempting a re-boot. Moves into a more clearly dystopia setting, which is a plus in my book. Sound track has clear similarities to Arrival, but ends up a little aggressive; both uncomfortably loud at points and some too quiet dialogue. Demands a second viewing.",1
242,"When I watched Original Blade Runner at my childhood years I was not impressed by a movie. Then before watching BR2049 I watched it again. And I understood why people love it and many directors and creators were inspired by that. So I was excited to see it now and good that I do not have nostalgia for an original one, since I watched it just recently. First at all, VISUALS. Denis Villeneuve and operator worked one the best looking movies. And visuals are masterly emphasize futuristic objects/ SCI Fi elements. I loved that like an original movie, future here represent in a really realistic way. You believe that in few decades we may live like that. And I can say that about whole movie. It feels down to earth. Nothing feels fake. Soundtrack is wonderful and it relates to the action very well. Ryan Gosling is a very good. Sci Fi Noir is very rare genre in movie industry and you have to watch this movie If you are movie nerd. Only doensides I have. That is eventually, movie falls flat. Some story lines do not have any progression. Jared Leto is wasted. And overall it does not make you think a lot. Well, it may be just a start and we will see an another  sequel.",1
243,"A true masterpiece, both in terms of science fiction, and the art of cinema in general. Visually, it's one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, period. Nearly every scene looks like something out of a painting. The acting is phenomenal, with a near perfect cast. One of my biggest criticisms with most of today's movies is that they never take the time to tell their story. Blade Runner does exactly the opposite: each & every scene is critical to the plot of the film, so when you hear someone say it's sucks because of how long it is, they probably prefer loud, boring movies like Michael Bay's crapfest.",1
244,"There is a lot more to this screenplay than meets the eye. I think this is one of those films that demands 3 or 4 viewings before you can get a grasp on it. For one thing, the sensory overload on the first viewing kind of blunts a lot of the subtext. The cinematography and sound are nearly beyond belief. True art. The music is grand. The acting and characters are tremendous. If you're not a fan of Russian cinema or deliberate directors like Kubrick --you'll probably hate it. Go see Transformers 8. This isn't the movie for you. Will probably bomb at the box office because it's a thinking man's film, and that is just a damn shame.",1
245,"Amazing film, so much to think about for scifi fans. Really hope more people give this film a chance because it deserves a better box office than right now.",1
246,"I thought it was good. The cinematography is excellent, a treat for the eyes. There's a lot of things to like about this movie for sure. There's a slow burn meditation feel here that I really appreciate.But I must take issue with those claiming that it is a masterpiece and equal to the original.Overall, 2049 is joyless and too clinical and serious. Characters lack depth and there's not much emotional complexity to interactions. We also don't experience the cultural immersion like in the original. Clutter, dilapidation, the real life of despair and loneliness on a personal level was what Blade Runner somehow captured and somehow was able to transcend and give a glimpse of hope.BR 2049 is a bleak dystopian wasteland. The soundtrack is mostly full of industrial sounding doom horns blasting you into submission, and at times this sonic approach is ill-placed. There is little subtlety - it pales in comparison to the Vangelis score.2049 is well-made, it is gorgeous and crafty, and it does not commit any major sins. But I really doubt this will be one we will be watching over and over and over again for decades to come. Just go and watch the original, and you will realize how much this sequel is lacking in complexity and soul.",1
247,"Its the most beautiful and thoughtprovoking film ive ever seen. This is the peak of the filmmaking and no one should miss it! Even the first one was not as good as this, im blown away and cant wait to view ist again.",1
248,"BR2049 is a masterpiece, a brilliantly directed and absolutely visually stunning film. BR2049 compliments the original 1982 Blade Runner cult classic with action, drama, suspense and a plot which connects the original film perfectly. The film is a must see in an IMAX theater to fully appreciate everything BR2049 has to offer however it is a must see on the big screen. Finally a film has been made that reminds me of why we go to the movies. One of the best films you will ever experience in IMAX or the big screen. Blade Runner 2049 is a must see...",1
249,"Very faithful to and like the original it's a long slow build to a somewhat rewarding payoff, but unlike the original this isn't a ground breaking cinematic experience simply because it's a decades later sequel taking all its cues from the first one.  The story is a compelling if convoluted follow up probably requiring having seen and liked ""Blade Runner"" to appreciate, with this movie delivering a single timely scene alone worth the price of admission, perhaps some of the most imaginative visuals and the best sound in a movie theatre this year (best suited in IMAX), and a supporting actor Oscar caliber performance by Harrison Ford.",1
250,"2049 is a deceiving film. It is very slow paced and atmospheric, which is in contrast to the original, which contained a lot more action and tension. Beautifully shot and acted, it nearly is set to be a perfect film, but where it fails is in the length of certain scenes that do not add to character development.",1
251,"I originally didn't care at all about Blade Runner 2049. But when I was impressed by the second trailer, and found out that the director of the excellent Arrival was directing this, I gave it a shot. I had a mixed experience. Yes, the visuals are amazing, the acting is good, and the soundtrack has some good parts, but I found the soundtrack got a bit repetitive at times, and there were a few of obnoxiously strange and sickening scenes in the movie that serve no purpose. But at least the director treats the audience like adults and doesn't cram a bunch of over bloated exposition down our throats. There were only a handful of scenes that I genuinely enjoyed, though. I might rewatch this later on, and I'm probably gonna watch the original Blade Runner soon, but at the moment, Blade Runner 2049 is just a decent movie for me.",1
252,Gran obra que retoma la película de 1981 desde un ángulo distinto. Lleno de híper-textualidades y un uso maravillosos de las tomas panorámicas en una civilización colapsada. Ejercicio de reflexión sobre la importancia de la memoria.,1
253,"They really captured the feel of the first movie in this one, the world was just as futuristic and corrupt and modern day CGI really helped flesh out the cinematic style. The story was solid and entertaining and most of the characters played out exactly as intended.My only problems were with Gosling - who can pull off an emotionless replicant pretty well, but isn't very good at expressing emotion later on as his character develops, and the music didn't really compare to the incredible soundtrack they had in the previous movie. Other than that it is a very good continuation of the Blade Runner story and I would defiantly recommend seeing it on the big screen to get the full experience.",1
254,"I think this maybe is one of those movies I will have to review more times to have a complete opinion. At first sight I think it lacks the delicious tempo of the first one mixing action scenes with long artistic ones. I also find that the philosopy it has been too simplified to make it a commercial product and finally, it is obviously too open to a third one...or more, I usually like more subtle ones.",1
256,"One of the best movies that came out this year, no doubt regarding that. The whole movie is simply mesmerizing, and the cinematography and visuals are indeed truly exceptional. This movie totally deserves your money.",1
257,"Blade Runner 2049 is a nice movie that can be slow, but will most likely put a smile on your face.",1
258,"Blade Runner 2049 is one of the greatest science fiction noir films of this decade. It's rich with VFX and a narrative that builds upon the world and characters of the previous film. The slow burn of the runtime pulls off a third act that is just **** awesome, and the filmmakers should be commended for their work.",1
259,"This was beautifully crafted and has a lovely style to it. Even with an almost 3 hours running time, it didn't drag and I didn't feel bored. Definitely recommend if you're a fan of the original.",1
261,"BR 2049 is visually stunning, just like the first movie. At almost 3 hours it is too long. They should of edited it down to 120 minutes",1
262,"Absolutely and utterly brilliant.  I expected a movie with some scenes reminiscent of the original epic film.  What I received was answers to the lingering questions I've had since I saw Bladerunner in 1982.  The love of the original is evident in this followup. The subtle nod to Rutger Hauer's scene left me breathless.  If you're an unfeeling angry cynic who sat down to this movie expecting to hate it, I feel sorry for you. I never considered that Ridley Scott might outdo himself after Prometheus.  I stand corrected. This was a beautiful moving picture.",1
263,"I have to admit that when I love a film as much as I did the original Blade Runner I was both very excited and very nervous to watch a sequel. Will it add to the story? Will it cheapen the story? Will it take it directions I don't personally feel the original pointed? Well, I will say that this sequel is a well made film but to me it is very different from the original...even though it borrows some of the same characters, settings, and sounds. The original was at its core a detective story that just happened to take place in the future. The philosophical elements about topics such as slavery, religion, and technological vs. organic ""life"" were present and dealt with within the action, but in the sequel they are the story and it is handled in such a heavy, depressing way that I can't really say I enjoyed it. I respect it, I appreciate the artistry in its creation, but I really didn't have fun watching it...and I recall having immense fun watching the original. This sequel is just so damn bleak. What is the point of even existing in that world?",1
264,"Well worth the wait.  I was terrified they were going to dump over the original with a lacklustre sequel but they respectfully incorporated the first movie while going somewhere original too.   I think this is a movie I will watch again and again.  Wonderful.  Thanks to all the creators, you have created an amazing piece of art and a thoroughly enjoyable piece of entertainment.",1
265,"A good movie, and good sequel, i watched the first one (for the first time) the day before, and i think it is the best movie i've watched this year so far.",1
266,"Was totally blown away as I really feared a sequel to the original masterpiece and one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.2049 is what SW:TLJ is not: aware of its heritage and completely absorbs its world building and pacing.Another masterpiece, just like the original that aged so very well and yet we have a modern one. Great visual and auditive experience too.",1
267,"Beautiful, spectacular and deep as the original ! Villeneuve managed to do what I didn't imagine possible : expanding the universe of an all-time sci-fi classic without killing or denaturing it (Hello Last Jedis), however adding interesting elements to the plot.Can't wait for the remake of Dune now, a universe deserving a movie at its level (besides Jodorwski's Dune documentary)",1
268,"Gorgeous cinematography, great screen chemistry between Ford and Gosling. The story wasn't all that fantastic. There was too much unnecessary nudity. Music score was fantastic! The ending was flat.  The director's work in Arrival was much better.",1
269,"The best movie cyberpunk of 2017 and in general last 5 years. Yes the sequel is much simpler than the original. In general Denis Villeneuve the excellent director, has perfectly reported the atmosphere of the original, but after all the first hour of the movie is tightened and in general almost doesn't bear important semantic loading. Jarrett Leto has perfectly played the antagonist, will be sure continuation soon and he will be revealed completely as personnel. And the main thing, is an ending. She has a little disappointed, after all there is a wish to see the complete final, let and open, but complete. As in the first part, but not just end of a deytstviye and credits.",1
270,"Great movie, really enjoyed watching it. The movie was a bit too long for my liking, but but the music and acting is on point. Definitely worth watching.",1
271,"When I saw or managed to make it thru the very slow burner that was Blade Runner The Final Cut, I was obviously dubious about this. I thought that I’d need to see and enjoy the original before this. Denis Villeneuve quotes you don’t need to have seen the original to enjoy his film cos this stands on its own. Though a lot of the film does involve the original in its plot. So I sat down to watch this juggernaut of a film, and juggernaut I mean 2 hours 43 mins. You do get sceptical as why it’s that long and think am I wasting my time and money here but. And big but. I watched Mark Kermode gives his review. He said that opening 30 mins of the movie surprisingly set the amazing pace and that in itself defines the greatness of this epic film. There are no standout performances here, not Gosling, not Ford, no one but there is one and that is the director Denis Villeneuve. What he delivers here is something of awesomeness, something astonishing. The visuals, the lighting, everything about the design and scale of this is just mind blowing. You definitely don’t have to enjoy the original to enjoy this. And at 163 mins, it doesn’t feel that long at all. This really is the creme de la creme of sci fi perfection. And ok I said earlier that Gosling and Ford aren’t the standout performers but there performances are brilliant. Gosling’s performance is of particular interest considering a year ago he was nominated for best actor for La La Land. But forget La La Land here. This is simply put the greatest sci fi, action thriller ever made. Denis Villeneuve your the man. Shame you didn’t get a best director nod at this years Oscars, just the nomination would have sufficed. 5 out 5, 10 out 10.",1
272,"This movie did for Blade Runner what Mad Max: Fury Road did for the Mad Max franchise; impossibly recaptured the original glory some 30+ years later.  I was around in the early 8Os when Blade Runner came out...one thing this sequel couldn't recapture was the bleak Asian noir of a future some 30 years away It was realistic gritty window into the far future for 80s folk and it was mesmerizing.  Even though the new movie didn't recapture the far future mesmerizing effect...it couldn't...it did copy exactly that bleak Asian noir of the near future.  Back then we saw a vision of what could be and arguably made it come true in a lot of ways.  Today the atmosphere seems familiar and enveloping and 'hey were gonna have that done in a few years, I can already see it' type way.""We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time."" - T. S. Eliot",1
273,"First off, this movie is quite amazing. From its cinematography, to its acting, to its overall plot it is a phenomenal movie from start to finish. But this is not a movie to go see with your friends. The one thing you need to know is that you really need to pay attention to what happening. You should not look at your phone when watching this movie. This movie is almost 3 hours long and you really need to pay attention in order to get whats going on in this film. The pacing of the movie is slow and it takes its time explaining what is happening on screen, but paying attention is a definite. But if you have the time, this movie is surely worth the money!",1
274,"It's an amazing picrure. A near perfect, with deep deep atmospere. A masterpiece.",1
275,"Blade Runner 2049 is a great movie that keeps you guessing until the very end. The movie has a great cast and plot. Also, the tech that was created for this movie seems so real and fits so well into their crafted world. The only negative for me would be the ""soundtrack"". Villeneuve opted to copy the booms and bass drops from his other movie the Arrival and I feel that it distracts from the movie in places.",1
276,"Great story and visual effects. I liked this one more than the original. Great performances by Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford. Sometimes it was hard to keep up because some much is happening in this movie. I like the throwbacks to the old movie, with the old recordings, that was a nice touch. People say this is the best Sci-fi of 2017. I say it's one of the best, as there were great, and for me personally better sci-fi movies in 2017.",1
277,Its pretty good especially visually..Just not as good as the original one.,1
278,"the movie is amazing from start to end, a sequel the original deserves, a must see movie",1
279,"This movie reminds me of why I love watching movies.it has everything perfect I mean every Little thing is perfect stars from Screenplay is awesome it has every layer that I want from the movie like Blade Runner.I am a big fan of Ridley Scott's original 1982 Blade Runner its flawed masterpiece and I love the movie too.let's talk about the cinematography of Mr. Roger Deakins I love that mans vision for movies the visuals are mesmerizing and heart touching and a lot of the work, not Evan Camerawork. Mr.Deni Villeneuve directing doing such a fantastic job he is the guy who created Sicario,Prisoner,Enemy,and arrival it makes total seance that he is Great director working today and lets talk about acting of Ryan Gosling this man is getting better and better at his job his work is amazing and Harrison Ford and Robin Wright also did nice job and also Female Actress as well.The soundtrack of this move is Beautiful as hell and overall this is the best Sci-fi movie I have seen in a long time.One thing that I am very impressed about that is they didn't try too hard for making this sequel I mean they didn't try to make a 7 or 8 movie franchise they just make a great Sequel of all time. This movie is now on my all-time best movies list.",1
280,Put on headphones sit back and let your mind get blown. It takes two viewings to appreciate what this really is. I saw it at the theatre and wasn't sure but once I saw it again at home I realized this is a masterpiece.,1
281,"(96/100)I have no words... This is just a really f*cking good Sci-Fi movie! Better than the first one. I love these characters, I love this world. I want to see more! I'm so invested in this world eversince watching the first Blade Runner. Denis Villeneuve said that the original cut was 4 hours and I definitely want to see that cut. I want like a Blade Runner 2049 Part II. I never have this urge to see more of a world created by such amazing people, but I do for this movie. I love the way how the story isn't finished (except for Joe) and that it continues without us knowing how, It leaves open possibilities for the future. The cast was also very strong and I like the way how the movie just starts without us knowing who any of these people are. As the story moves along you get more and more invested in Joe's character and want him to find out the truth. The cinematography is also very well done, the best I've seen so far. Roger Deakins sure knows how to film a scene.",1
282,"Blade Runner 2049Director: Dennis VilleneuveRelease Date: October 6, 2017I cannot stress enough to see this movie only seeing the first trailer to come out and because I don’t want to spoil the story I wont be delving into the summary of the film only the reasons it deserves your attention.. My expectations were set at this middling point of ok fro this film. I though they are either building upon the classic sci-fi masterpiece Blade Runner (released in 1982), or they are delivering this film for a complete cash in and an investment banking on the new generation liking it inevitably setting up future films they aren't necessary franchise films. But that’s the key word in describing Blade Runners brilliance, necessary. Sequels hardly ever do good because they weren't planned to be made, they feel like excess lore that usually feels only questionably fitting. But Blade Runner 2049 not only fits into the blade runner universe, but after seeing it I realized it filled a whole in my heart I didn’t realize I had. Blade Runner 2049 is going to be a pillar of a film I point to that stresses the masterful skill we have today. Roger Deacons , Hans Zimmer, and Dennis Villeneuve form a cinema dream team. The music rumbles with prestige at the perfect moments to exemplify the intensity in the scene. The cinematography is simply some of the best work I've seen from Roger Deacons (also known as one of the most revered and talented cinematographers to hit the industry) with such an expanded amount of colors and riveting set pieces truly do the job of immersing you in this universe. And Dennis Villeneuve has proven himself a master in this new era of film making; transcending one of the greatest films ever made with a story (which I wont spoil) that hooks you with thought provoking themes, sharp turns to keep from falling into predictableness and tugging on the moral heartstrings fantastically all while building these few but very memorable characters with unflinching performances. Everything is delivered with such refinement, Blade Runner 2049 earns the respect from new film goers and fans of the original alike, being one of the greatest sequels ever made and the best film of the year.",1
283,"Blade Runner 2049, like it's predecessor, is a flawed masterpiece, except it isn't flawed. Right from the opening shot you are immersed into this bleak world. The atmosphere and the haunting score complement the already fantastic cinematography to make this one of the years highlighted films. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford give their best performances to date, which helps elevate the story (which I won't spoil here) to a masterful degree. In fact, every actor and actress in this film give it everything they have and it shows. There isn't a single weak link in the cast which you cannot say very often. This is one of the years best films, if not the best. If your a fan of the original or sci-fi movies in general, you owe it to yourself to watch this masterpiece of a film!",1
284,"I generally hate the word 'awesome' but it's a fitting description of Blade Runner 2049. Watching it {on the biggest screen I could find} took me back to the days when going to the cinema was an 'event'. The film, while not without its flaws is a mesmerizing experience as a whole. Highly recommended.",1
285,"This is an outstanding movie. Very well-directed, and the design (and attention to detail) is exceptional...I can’t believe it, but this is a worthy sequel to the original.It’s definitely atmospheric, so don’t go in expecting the emphasis to be on action. I don’t know how else to say it: my friends and I left the theater and agreed that we were blown away.Instant classic. There, I said it!",1
286,"There's simply no justification for the 9 and 10 ratings - pure shills. This is a 7 at best but far worse for me due to its glacial pacing and dim/dark lighting. It's a film that you can feel yourself actually age. The plot is totally obtuse, I defy anyone to tell me what the #$%^ the point of this was, on your own without internet assistance. And Harrison Ford at age 75 has no business being cast in this. He doesn't need the money or attention and we deserve to see better than old geezers in their last hurrah. Thank god for the distractingly gorgeous Ana de Armas, without her in it the film is a flat zero. The VFX swerve from great to awful and the accompanying music is worthless, though at times the foreboding made my soundbar awesome, but for a 2.5 hr experience my soundbar should've been rocking most of that time. Poor, poor effort.",0
287,Two and a half hours of Ryan Gosling staring mournfully into the middle distance. I liked the flying cars. So slow I almost fell asleep in the middle of the movie.,1
288,"Having grown up in the 80's and 90's I was exposed to many amazing films.   Films that set the stage for the cinema we now know.  Groundbreaking themes, visuals, sound and more.   The original film, Blade Runner, was one of these films and when a sequel was (finally) officially announced, I was both delighted and skeptical of this new film. Having seen it today, I am pleased to announce that I feel it was the perfect sequel, flaws and all. for more: http://wp.me/p93it6-Ik",1
289,"I kept watching for an hour. Hoping that there was something to come, got to bored. Really with these actors, why not make a movie that keeps your attention at least. So sad they didn't use the potential, maybe better next time? The original was way bettersorry.",0
290,"There is one thing that bothered me throughout the whole movie. Even though the soundtrack was amazing on its own it did not fit the scenes half the time. Music was super dramatic while what was happening on screen was nothing worth mentioning. Music alone is not enough to make a scene dramatic or deep, it has to be a combination of both. They were force feeding us ""Look at how deep and existential this looks and sounds!!!"" while the plot was mediocre at best.",0
291,"BR2049 is nothing more than sci-fi porn. And like most higher-end porn, there's but a mere soupçon of a story, which only aids in serving the inevitable money shot. The inevitable money shot hit audiences square in the eyes, but there's clearly a latency of pain  or else more viewers would feel as I and many others do—that this reboot is a total failure from beginning to end. It steals its core idea from Battlestar Galactica and is basically a mishmash of other sci-fi tropes and traps into which the movie keeps sinking. Horrible. Sad. Shameful. The original BR was brilliant and masterful and subtle. This one is the exact opposite. Jared Leto and Robin Wright are completely miscast and laughable caricatures of themselves. The director should never direct another picture again until he's made to watch good, classic films that were made before MTV ruined everything for us.",0
292,"Blade Runner 2049 is a beautiful unicorn of a film. The kind of film that only comes along once every few years. And it'll probably be talked about for years. Its very much art house film but with a modern blockbusters budget and resources. The film plays with complex concepts that can quickly turn into debates. People have complained that the film is long and drags on. And if your looking for action events and plot twists that will be your experience. The film is like a 10 layer puzzle. The problem, like the original, is that the simplest layer on the bottom is strange and doesn't have much going on. Since that is usually all there is to simpler action flicks, if you don't look on other levels for more then you get bored. But on every other layer of the puzzle the pieces add up. The rules of the universe are self consistent and not broken. The narrative makes certain logic jumps without spoon-feeding you the information. Again, off-putting to people used to being spoon-fed every plot point. My experience for the first viewing of the film was with a language I am not yet fluent in. So a lot of the conversation was lost on me. I was amazed by the visual storytelling that was going on. My second viewing, in my native language, only added to it, though it helped I could focus on other details the second time around. More than 1 viewing suggested! Overall it is an incredibly impressive film, toying with the fundamental concept of what it means to be human. And what it means to be human in a world where memory can be implanted, where creations are becoming more perfect than their creators and what it means when you can't tell the difference anymore. In a way the film borrows ideas from other P.K.Dicks novels and takes them great places. True to the universe of the original film it also cut key elements of the book out. Overall best film I've seen in ages. Also props to the director. The romantic encounter scene is something absolutely unique. Given how often that contents been put to film, truly a feat!",1
293,"""Blade Runner 2049"" was a very good film, the special effects and story were amazing, and as long as the performances were great. Ryan Gosling was very good in his role, we see again Harrison Ford, playing Rick Deckard, and Ford does not fail, this movie has been one of the biggest and one of the best this year.",1
294,"This long-awaited sequel starts 30 years after the original, when a new blade runner (Ryan Gosling) is on a quest to uncover secrets and discover the fate of the original star (Harrison Ford). This film is LONG on atmosphere (and I mean 140 minutes). The wasteland settings and vast modern interiors are interesting, although they never seem as captivating as the original. There are some cool tricks, but nothing more original than numerous other films have done. Everyone is very serious and they take FOREVER to do anything. This film is about 30 minutes past its prime. Still, there are stimulating elements to the filmmaking that create magnificent moments of desolation and intrigue.",1
295,It looks great. The acting is good. The production values are excellent. I almost fell asleep at least 3 times while watching it in the afternoon. It's too slow paced. It's confusing. It's too long. On one hand I was bored and on the other I was thrilled. I should have waited for the Netflix release though. I wasn't blown away by anything and think it's over hyped.,1
296,"A visual masterpiece with a plot that nods to the original without completely relying on it. New characters are well written. Environments are fleshed out, and the set designs are incredibly detailed. Soundtrack meshes with the visual in perfect harmony. A true break-through for Sci-Fi films in the 21st century. Still able to keep an art house feel despite being a big budget movie. In my opinion it even does several things better than the original. My favorite film to be released in the past decade.",1
298,"Stunning imagery, immersive sound effects, well-crafted characters and a story filled with mystery ensure Denis Villeneuve's sequel matches the original Blade Runner. Blade Runner 2049 brings the dystopian world back to life in spectacular fashion.",1
299,"I don’t think anyone would argue that this isn’t faithful to the original movie and, to be honest, I felt much the same way about this movie as I did about the original. The world in which the movie exists is amongst the most well realised in cinema and the central idea of what actually means to be human remains and interesting one even thirty years on. At times however the pacing is just so slow and, with the movie almost hitting the three hour mark, it really could have done with a bit more action to break things up a little or a little editing to reduce the length of some of the many scenes of exposition and philosophising.",1
300,"I have seen the original version of Blade Runner so many times that I probably have it memorized. Unfortunately, I did not completely appreciate this latest version, which was overblown in my opinion and too repetitive – which is odd since I would not say that about any of the Villeneuve films I have seen (Prisoners, Sicario, The Arrival). Both my companion and I almost dozed off at some point early in the film, but the second half held our attention. One problem for me was missing the many interesting, original minor characters in the original that kept things livelier. A new set would have been appreciated instead of Ryan Gosling and his many, many wounds and the many women who turned up in various forms. A disappointment. Not terrible, but not great either",1
301,People giving this 10/10 are either paid to do so or have no frikin idea. This movie is terrible. 3/10 for the effects only. Not even Harrison Ford could save it.,0
304,Blade Runner 2049 was so long it felt more like Blade WALKING. 2 stars because I liked some parts. Ridley Scott? Ridley Shot himself in the foot with this one!,0
308,"It is abundantly obvious why this movie didn't do as well as expected. It's too slow. Every shot, every single shot, lingers lovingly over every setting, every landscape, every apartment interior, every closet, every object, every little thing for twice, three times, sometimes eight times as long as needed to 'get it' - it's like watching a long game of golf. And the dialog. Someone speaks. Then there is this huge long pause before the other person responds. It's like the director or editor takes too high a dose of anti-depressants and he's just moving in slow motion. This movie should literally be half as long as it is or shorter. When released on demand and DVD a shorter cut should be included. Someone who had the power to say yay or nay fell asleep at the wheel letting this movie go out to theaters in this condition. It could have made twice as much money if it had reasonable pacing.The second problem with this movie is that there's not enough Harrison Ford. I know he's old and a lot of people think he's a star of days gone by, but as soon as he enters this movie, as soon as you hear his voice, the movie gets real. It takes on more dimension, assumes real gravitas, and feels like a real movie. It's as if the other guy, Gosling (who never showed any emotion, which made him boring), was just there to hand the movie off to Ford and they took too long to do it. Also, they really should have made Gosling's holographic girlfriend do something critical to the plot. She acted well. The concept was cool. But ultimately, she supplied nothing critical to the story. That should have been fixed. A character who takes up so much on-screen time in a movie should not be expendable.The third problem with this movie, which I think is the least important but it still bugged me, is that it doesn't look like Blade Runner. One reviewer said it looks more like Blade Runner than Blade Runner. But that's just not true. It lacks the dense urban neon crazy visual chaos of Blade Runner. It trades that for vast rust colored expanses that are nice, but are just a different aesthetic, and gives an entirely different feel to the movie. Sure, you get obligatory passes in the floating cars over the city, but even that looks quite different.But even without reshooting anything, they could vastly increase the quality of this film just by cutting out all the dead space between dialog and cutting out all the gratuitous lingering pans. There is so much of that people in the theater were sighing and huffing with impatience. We wanted to see what came next, but it was like wading through molasses. And if there's any additional film of Harrison Ford on the cutting room floor, splice it into the movie. This movie needs more Ford!",1
309,Its extremely silent movie which is almost 3 hours long. One of the most boring and depressing movies I have ever seen.,0
311,Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best movies I've seen in 2017. Didn't found it boring at all.,1
312,"A story that didn't need to be told ended up being the story I didn't know I needed. 2049 expands on the world created by its predecessor and still manages to be as daring and beautiful. The 2 hour and 45-minute run-time somehow seem shorter than the 2 hours of the original (depending on what version you watch, duh). This movie is masterclass from Denis Villeneuve because every single decision made in this movie was the best one possible.",1
313,"You might as well watch the original Blade Runner from 1982. It has stronger acting, better characters, an unpredictable story and fascinating cinematography. Though 2049 excels with its slow pace and spectacular presentation, it is ultimately a lifeless (pun intended) philosophical diatribe. A quintessential cerebral mess which asks too many questions without answering any from the first film. It's less like a sequel and more like a diversion. The ending is enough to make me wish I was a replicant so I wouldn't be so disappointed.",0
315,"Personally less than impressed with Blade Runner 2049. There's a core story here that's good, but that story was stretched far too long before it could be realized. The twists in the plot came way too late and thus failed to keep me hooked. I believe the movie would have kept much better pace cutting down by half.A little stimuli be it drama or action might have kept my blood circulating to prevent me from resting my eyes from time to time. The interaction with AI and the incredible tech required to create illusion seemed both extraordinary and out of place for the scenario, but that's minor. The action that did come felt exaggerated and unnecessary and something we've all seen a million times.The 'Replicants' are smart enough to know or grasp that something is wrong and yet they need a miracle to prove it? Apparently the newer lobotomized models need more convincing that their position sucks and therefore a miracle is appropriate.On the positive side the dystopian scenery is great and the acting is decent, but not even Harrison Ford could save this nearly three hour stoic-stroll through gloomy eco-winter from collapsing under its own weight.All I can say is I envy those who enjoyed it.",0
317,"I love the first film and watched it when it was first out then again many times.  I read a review by Rotten Tomatoes before going. Highly scored.  I disagree.  Boring, drawn out, lacking in action and characterisation. Best scene was the first scene. And worst of all unnecessary drama.  Where was any Rutger etc? A dismal sequel.",0
322,"I did not like it. It felt like the movie was trying to be profound and meaningful but was just boring and gimmicky. I also felt it was too violent. The violence in the original film was part of the story - it was visceral and painful. In 2049 it was gratuitous and unnecessary.I checked my watch 3-4 times during the film and left as soon as the credits rolled. So, yeah I was not impressed.I was expecting to see some blade running but instead I was left baffled by the meaningless plot.The crowning moment of the film's failure was the very poor ending. It was limp. The ending of the original film was powerful and nerve-shredding.",0
323,"The movie is long, loud, and there's lots of water. Other than that, nothing much really happens. I was a fan of the original blade runner and was blown away by how bad Ridley Scott mangled this opportunity.The most noteworthy character in the movie is played by insanely loud BRRRRRRAAAAAAAH sounds that occur every fifty seconds, presumably to keep watcher awake.Stay away, you can spend your time more wisely by staring at a wall, any wall, really.",0
324,"Overall it was interesting but deeply flawed. I wanted to like it, but I can see why it flopped so badly (grossed even less than The Mummy in its opening weekend LOL).GOOD- Spectacular visuals, as though the dystopia of the original has taken several big steps closer to hell in the last 30 years (reinforced by how the old music has been remixed to be discordant and oppressive)- The hologram girlfriend was a cute concept, though she is largely irrelevant to the plot- I respect that it at least tried to be a thoughtful movie for grownups, something that is increasingly rare these days (especially for big budget movies). Though I have to admit it's not really as smart as it thinks it is, mainly because the ideas it grapples with (""what if people were... ROBOTS?"") don't actually resonate with anything real. Really the most powerful thing about it was the portrayal of urban decay and alienation via the eternal trifecta of pollution, multiculturalism, and corporate greed.BAD- Making the main character a robot was unbelievably stupid. Gosling's flat affect and lack of personality make it impossible to emotionally engage with the character. Since this is 100% Gosling's story, the fact that he's a mopey unrelatable autistic robot (who barely even shows any warmth to his videogame girlfriend) absolutely cripples the movie's emotional impact.- Bringing back Harrison Ford was also dumb. Rick Deckard is not an iconic character, nobody cares what became of him and seeing him again is not an exciting prospect. Harrison Ford needs to quit rehashing every role he did back when movies were original and good.- Way too long for what it is, with many slack scenes that drag out self-indulgently. A competent editor could easily get this below 2 hours with the plot intact.- Ultimately the big reveal (""ZOMG A REPLICANT GOT PREGNANT!"") isn't that interesting plotwise or thematically. News flash: humanoid robots aren't real and probably never will be, so ""what if they could get pregnant"" isn't a meaningful question to explore (contra the fanboys, it doesn't actually ""make you think about what it means to be human"" or w/e). After Villenueve kept claiming there was going to be a huge earthshaking twist, he needed to deliver something much better than this (should've used the element from the book where replicants have infiltrated business/media/government and are trying to twist them to their own ends).- For a movie that takes itself so seriously it sure had a ton of lame genre cliches, including the one-dimensionally evil corporate magnate having a beautiful ninja robot assassin bodyguard, who has a kung fu fight with hero at the climax. If I wanted goofy stuff like that I would've watched the crappy Ghost in the Shell remake again.It's really a shame this was such a box office disaster, since there was clearly a lot of thought and effort that went into making it. But I can't blame audiences for not lining up to watch 3 hours of grim navel-gazing about robots grappling with robot existentialism.",0
325,"+'s Visuals, Acting, CGI, Themes-'s Editing, Sound, PlotGreat visuals and themes let down by the plot holes and poor writing. Too much pandering to the audience and repetition of simple points. Editing cuts were too long & boring without substance. Overall film too long. Music can be great but the jump-scare sounds were too much, the sounds of city when flying were terrible, also a poor echo affect on a lot of dialogue in open settings which makes very hard to hear. Too much unexplained in the plot, why were there no other flying cars in a city of millions? Its only slightly better than Ghost in the Shell 2017.",0
327,"I really don't get why there are so many positive reviews to such a boring movie.It's one of those self absorbing don't take the camera off of me im a demigod kind of film that deserves zero praise. I Don't get why the audience fail to see this.  Viewers instead pretend to be socialite critiques trying so hard themselves to be notice and praised, so they write a review that there social media sheeple will think is acceptable, thus you have all these unworthy positives. Entire movie is bland, not much more i need to say. Just believe me when i tell you this and not the social media sheeple idiots.",0
329,"I found this film to be quite poor. The production, acting and music were just fine, but somewhere along the way, the sense of intrigue, the sense of fun, a decent pace, and a good story were sadly cast aside for a slow, ponderous movie of little interest. The first Bladerunner is a fine film in all its versions. Bladerunner 2049 will just go down in history as a non starter, dulled beyond belief. A huge disappointment.",0
332,"I would really, really like to know if all the critics who gave the new Blade Runner movie five stars saw the same film I did.1) MOVIE: Overdrawn, overlong dramatic scenes, which often substituted LOUD soundtrack for real drama. Literally, my wife and I had to HOLD OUR HANDS over our ears at four or five points in the film. Not cool.....of course, my perceptions could have been tainted by the....2) Theater: Stank. Literally, stank. and the handle on My wife's seat's armrest broke at one point and I ended up wearing most of her soda pop on my leg3) Movie again: attempts to be deep and thoughtful too often become pretentious. This was literally the single worst moviegoing experience of my life. Bleh.",0
333,"As a qualifier, I’m old enough to have seen and been a big fan of the original Blade Runner, plus I’ve always been a sci-fi fan. That said, the better half and I were both disappointed in this sequel. You know how you hear that much of a movie ends up on the cutting room floor? Well for this movie it’s like they forgot to do the cutting; they just left everything in it. Generally, it comes across as a film that is trying way too hard to be “epic”. Yes there are long sweeping vistas, advanced cinematography and long scenes with very sparse dialogue. Sometimes this approach can be entertaining, but for 163 minutes? This film requires a large capacity bladder and if you include previews, be aware you will be sitting there for about 3 hours. Where the original had so much action and interesting characters, this sequel is almost the opposite; most characters show no emotion at all and the whole thing drags so slowly, we came close to walking out after about two excruciating hours. I’ll admit performances by Ford, Gosling and Leto were good considering the script they were handed. However again it was way too long and to make matters worse, you leave with hardly a hint of an uplift.",0
334,Why is this movie 2 hours and 45 minutes?Saw it with a friend who is like a cult-fan of the original. I just can't get over how long the movie was. The story wasn't particularly interesting to me either.,0
335,"More than 2 1/2 hours long, I knew it had to have something or other, to hold my attention, but no, I sat through the whole thing waiting for something interesting to happen. Ryan Gosling can't act, what a shocker! Turgid script, even vacuous in parts. 'Pris' lookey likey, was the worst actress of all.Look all you Producers out there, Robin Wright has hit the wall, so stop casting her.The only good bit for me was the baddie, Sylvia Hoeks did a fine job with the script she was given, but she should've been given more to do, what a waste.",0
336,"+ Great panoramic views & cgi, good sound quality, cool actors.- boring story & paper thin plot. Minutes of slow motion movement & staring somewhere behind the camera. To be honest, we all know how it is to be caught in thoughts for hours, but actually seeing it on screen? Pew, thats not the reason to go to the cinema. That whole movie felt for me like they took the main Charakter from Drive (ultra boring movie in my opinion) and trow him into the world of Blade Runner. Go watch the 1 Movie or Blade Runner Black Out 2022, that anime short movie is far better than this. But THIS, its not even the best movie of the month :(",0
337,"Sad to say it but Blade Runner 2049 is a dark, dull, hot-mess of a film—largely pointless and does nothing to advance the franchise.  Only lonely fan-boys whose greatest fantasy is to take Siri or Alexa to their senior prom will find anything to like about this film. Worse yet is that the plot is basically lifted from the DaVinci Code--our hero deciphers sketchy clues from a lost age only to discover that he is searching for a ""miracle"" child hidden and protected by a secret society.  Sound familiar?  Visually interesting if you enjoy prolonged shots of bizarre architectural spaces of pointless design and Ryan Gosling's scruffy nerf-herder face staring blankly at them.  At least the soundtrack contains enough needlessly booming discordant notes to regularly startle viewers back to consciousness as they struggle to endure the 164 minute running time.  Very disappointing.",0
338,"If I could save one person the time and money, then I've done my part. If you like fun or entertainment in any form, don't waste your time on this film. If you like engaging, captivating storytelling - this movie is not for you.I can't even call it pretentious. It is a bad film because there's nothing appealing in it. Not bad in a good way, either, but simply boring, with unengaging characters, a foreign world that's never properly explained, and a tedious self-discovery journey, with some distant anti-human goals tacked in. The protagonist has zero charm, and the antagonist, or side characters, are about on the same level. The one minor character who had me curious is killed right in the opening scene - which happens to be the best in the film, by the way. Besides him, the only thing that merits some positive points is Harrison Ford's performance, which manages to bring in some levity, and a relatable character. However, he doesn't receive enough screen time to justify wasting 2.5 hours of your life watching a director experimenting with gloomy visual scenes, that have extremely dark lighting, and advance at an extremely slow pace, for no good reason. Rather than draw you in, they end up having zero emotional impact - just like the tiny, dead letters of the opening exposition.",0
340,"A visual masterpiece which unfortunately falls grossly flat of the (undeserved) hype. The original is a niche Sci-Fi classic which was not particularly popular upon release, in fact it was ridiculed. Any movie with 5 different versions obviously has something wrong with it, Ridley Scott has clearly acknowledged how broken it was/is. Harrison Ford has gone on record numerous times complaining about the entire process which is reiterated by his performance this time around.A run time of 2hrs 45mins is totally unnecessary and the entire thing could've been over and done in less than 90. Everything is drawn out, way longer than it needs to be.Gosling is as wooden as ever, he's channeled his character from Drive, Leto's over-the-top wannabe character actor melodrama is campy, he's still living off his Dallas Buyers Club success, the guy can't act. All the female leads are stereotypical Bond-esqe feme-fatals or damsels in distress. And lastly, Ford, Ford clearly doesn't want to be there (again) and with the amount of screen time he gets his $'s per minute pay check would be interesting.They story is utterly laughable and has none of the mystique of the first one, its so completely contrived that to perceive this as anything other than a Hollywood cash grab is a joke. The ""Love"" scenes are a jab at where mankind is heading because of technology, but again, totally unnecessary and cringe worthy.To summarise, I was stunned at how bad this film was, not disappointed, it was more like disbelief that something like this was (A) Made (B) Made this poorly.Not the worst box office movie of the year, but after Wind River, IT and Logan its miles off the mark.",0
341,"No, no, nooooooo! Please don't ever make me sit through that again. You can talk about character development and genres and whatever. This movie will take away your will to live!  If 2049 is going to look like that, I'm glad I won't be around. By the way, I had a private screening with 3D and RPX and an assigned seat!!!",0
342,"A steaming hot mess. I am not sure that with an outline of what was happening, I would even know. All noise and action and no real character or plot development. Great to look at and listen to but ultimately, completely empty. Entertaining if you don't need a story.",0
346,"I was looking forward to this movie.  I was disappointed because, yes the acting and cinematography were very good, the first hour was very boring.  I walked out of the theater after the hour but maybe it got better.",0
347,"Blade Runner is long and very slow. Supposedly this is to build the plot, but at times it is very hard to follow.  After we walked out of the movie I discussed the plot with the person I went with and they had completely missed what was going on. Worse, the ending makes no sense. Supposedly Harrison Ford can now meet his child but nothing has happened in the movie that allows that.  In good conscience I cannot recommend that anyone spend money on this movie.",0
348,"It ruined the original movie for me.  I am a die hard science fiction fan. Loved the original until I watched this. First time in my life I couldn't wait for the movie to end.  If my wife hadn't fallen asleep midway, we would have left. Boring, pretentious and self absorbing.  Although it was almost 3 hours long, it felt much longer.  Over the top musical score, all the actors did was stare and did not do the subject matter justice at all.  Extremely disappointed.  I waited for years and this is the **** the came up with?",0
349,A very very bad sequel. Instead of a good cyberpunk. Dear Ridley again continues to make films on biblical themes. I'm surprised that Michael fassbender did not appear in this movie.,0
350,"Dune/Matrix 2&3 bad... looooong, tedious, dreary and boring. I didn't care about any of the characters other than the Dave Bautista's Sapper Morton...save your theater-going money, wait for Free/$1.00 Blu-ray rental from your video store...not even Netflix worthy...certainly not a good sequel to the great original.",0
352,"I so wanted to love this movie: looks great, good acting. But the plot is trite and the script is dull. Worse, it is a movie that takes itself too seriously - it's trying to be an art house film, and by doing so it only manages to commit the cardinal sin of boring the audience.",0
354,"Blade Runner 2049 is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It's brilliantly atmospheric in ways that truly display the height of cinematography. Unfortunately, this is somewhat sullied by a misdirected story that is dragged out to the extreme. Even as a fan of movies that take their time developing, I practically fell asleep in the theatre watching this. Nothing felt meaningful and the entire story could've been told in a couple hours or less. However, seeing as I could easily watch it again on the visuals alone, I still believe it's a great movie.",1
355,"Love the first movie, but couldn't force myself to watch this one to the end. Due to lack of original mood and charm, i quickly got tired of cheap drama. Regardles of great CGI parts, the world just doesn't feel like distopian future - it looks like some ruined part of present day world, with hover cars and androids slapped on it.",0
357,"I never thought a sequel would happen. Great direction, good visuals, sound and style. A little artsy...The original Blade Runner is superior though.",1
358,"Completely over-rated by the critics, because they love this pretentious, slow-paced and confusing trainwreck of a sequel. Two of the female leads have noticeable Spanish accents to their English (similar to Penelope Cruz), which is jarringly out of place. The movie is unappealing due to some of its violent and sexual scenes that are in poor taste and unnecessarily long. Not enough action, and poorly written. The disappointment in the audience was palpable after the movie ended. Ridley Scott should have directed it himself instead of Villanueva.",0
361,"Bring a pillow and blanket - this is a sleeper...  What began as a visually striking movie with excellently staged cinematography, intriguing sets, and a few beautiful, sexy women, became a tiresomely long snore-fest.  This dragged on...and on...and ON...requiring much effort to stay awake through as the story-line took the occasional break from mind-numbing scenes of the characters meandering around in dark lands, to senseless violence.  People literally snored this, my wife fell asleep, and I wanted only one thing FOR IT TO FINALLY END.  Borrrrrrring...  Ryan Gossling stars in another stinker.  Save your money and watch TOTAL RECALL with the tracking so slow it adds another 45 minutes to the movie.",0
364,MAJOR disappointment. Movie was 1 hour to long and even then you would have been BORED! Acting wooden. Waste a time and money. FAKE REVIEWS! Make movies great again!,0
368,"Whoa, make sure you are wide awake for this 3 hour event or it will put you to sleep. But on second thought, they increased the volume so loud, quite a few times, we had to cover our ears. It woke us.  Harrison Ford arrives more than half way in and not many lines.",0
371,One of the most overrated movies of all time. None of it is that great or memorable,0
372,"From a movie enthusiastic person, this is the WORST NON-ACTION 'ACTION' MOVIE EVER 'CREATED' ON EARTH !!! I could not have been forced to WASTE MY 3 HOURS on it EVEN If I was PAID $50 to sit in this movie while TRYING NOT TO FALL ASLEEP !!! and BTW, I need my retribution for the CONSTANT OVERPLAYED LOUD MUSICAL EFFECTS for 3 HR Pain & Suffering..PS the ONLY Saving Grace to this movie is the beautiful virtual Cuban actress Ana De Armas!",0
374,Style over substance does not a great movie make.  Cool visuals.  Nice sound.  That's it. Period.  Had trouble staying awake.  That's the first test.  Does a film grab the audience and take them to a different place.  The original is far superior. Especially the end of the original with Rutger Hauer's monologue. Great stuff.  This 2049 film though . Doa.  This film is way too long and boring. Excite us. Take us on an adventure.  Show us what you are thinking. The movie makers failed.  Ruined a great franchise.,0
375,I gouged my eyes out with burning sticks because it was less painful than watching Blade Runner 2049.,0
377,"One of the best I have seen, and I’m no spring chicken, crossing all genres including landmarks like Ben Hur (1959), Titanic, Casablanca, 2001, Inherit the Wind (not Gone with), Amadeus, Saving Private Ryan - the list is not long. Blade Runner 2049, for the mature of all ages, is immersive, moving and stunning both visually and aurally and indeed it stands on its own, albeit the impetus for me was the original Blade Runner, making it the perfect sequel - as well. Purchased the movie in 3d to match my theatre viewing experience...and on my fifth home viewing....still incredible! The speculative, marketing inspired demise of 3d in North America is undoubtedly and assuredly premature. 3d format or otherwise the movie remains a masterpiece. It should be the Oscar pick for best movie of 2017, and the cast including Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Ana de Armas and others nominated in respective roles. Consummate actors all, not to mention Denis Villeneuve as Best Director. Thank Ridley Scott for recognizing his genius.The reality is that Science Fiction, even as a statement on the human condition, has never won an Oscar for Best Movie, as far as I know. The Academy Awards will likely miss this, caught up in the social media swamp and the cause of the day. The Academy will likely instead vote for an odd duck or more common place take on the triumphs and tribulations of the human condition, all destined to become mediocrities and also rans for 2017. This in turn, as it continues to demonstrate, makes Oscar night nothing more than a gossips’ social gathering and more redundant and meaningless than ever in what it’s function should be - rewarding real achievement in film.Meanwhile like the first Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049 will continue to attract an ever growing following and challenge current and future movie makers to raise the bar on what is now possible.",1
379,"My favourite movie of the year, I made an account just to grade this. It takes its time getting there but it's worth it, it's the kind of movie I wanted the first bad Blade Runner movie to be. Also a small side note it does a better job with female characters than its prequel and most movies nowadays and does so effortlessly.",1
380,"If humanity ever created a perfect movie, this is it. I don't want to say anything else because I feel it would spoil this piece of art.",1
381,"Much like it's predecessor but better, Villeneuve's take on Blade Runner recreates the original atmosphere, but also implements surprising twists and turns that do not bore the audience through the whole course of extensive run time.",1
384,"What an absolute piece of crap. Thought it would never end. The plot wasn't terrible, but damn it was painfully slow to develop. Not a lot of action either.",0
386,"Not Blade Runner in the slightest. Basically a reimagining. The movie as a whole is crafted well visually but plot holes, weird moments, laughable music, changes to locations, empty acting can't save it. For example the LAPD headquarters for Blade Runners is completely different. Why? Less rain throughout and instead a dusty ash like setting is used. Almost sterile locations compared to the original Blade Runner. Then you have a political motive by the end thrown in to make you roll your eyes even more. The pacing is almost comical that most shots linger on actors just starring off into space. As for the performers funny enough only Harrison Ford knows how to act and surprisingly the only part of the movie I enjoyed. If what you call acting is Gosling, the overrated Jared Leto and all the others just standing still not doing anything.. then it's time we really asked the question why these performers are paid high figures for this sort of thing? Acting has becoming modeling these days. Only Ford like I said made any sort of impact. Back to the very depressing plot, everything about it sucks including the revelation replicants can now have babies.. (wtf?!) and have skulls like humans? and what's the point of having replicants when you have AI holograms interacting with humans now? I know they don't do physical work but Pris was a pleasure model right? So why AI lovegrams all of a sudden? I mean there are so many plot holes and stupid ideas you wonder how this ever got off the ground. An insult to Ridley's original frankly. I guess maybe that's why they called it 2049 instead of Blade Runner 2. I was reluctant to see this but finally gave in because some were slamming Ford's appearance. Well Ford's expression and role in the whole film sums up my thoughts about it that you just want to retire and get as far away from LA as possible.",0
388,"I loved the fact that the movie had this typical sci-fi  world. But I know this world was built up in the first Blade Runner movie and I appreciate this but the thing is that it's not enough now to be fresh, and to stand out from the agglomerated genre. The actor did a enormous performance, especially Ford and Letho. But I felt like Ryan's performance on  the character was a little forced and he didn't have any real face gesticulation. The cinematography was slightly above average with the shots and scenes taken, and the writing of the movie was very absent, but on point for the events. The sound effects where very realistic, but the visuals where mind blowing, and gorgeous. Really stand out in this genre. Even the environment was on point for this universe, but it was disappointing that we didn't see any off worlds. There wasn't any humor which made the movie quite dull, and didn't help the overall fact to make the movie more fun to watch. But it was entertaining as it got, apart from the fact that it got some pacing issues. Like it was to slow, at times and lost me or the general audience. The plot was complex with it's twists and awesome narrative, and it was delivered with an amazing style. Also the message was pretty clear, and amazing for me. But that might shift for others. Also the action was lacking a lot of choreography and innovation.Overall it's a good movie, but it hasn't done enough to be considered as good and original as the old one. I think other critics are influence by the nostalgia of the previous movie.",1
389,"Quite disappointing movie. The style of cyberpunk is perfect, but the emotional part of the movie, really horrible. I can't even feel anything from that bad actor play. We must to empathy to Key, but he can't provide even a chance to do it. So I expected something more, than I got recently.",0
390,"Denis Villeneuve's immaculate visuals and the score from Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch lend themselves well to the Blade Runner experience, expertly recreating the tone and look of the original. This worthy follow up takes every element of it's predecessor and builds upon them. Even the idiosyncrasies of Ridley Scott's groundbreaking sci-fi film like the weird moments and awkward humor are used to much greater effect here. The latter feeling actually intentional this time around (because it is). Something that enables the laughs to feel natural and fluid, as opposed to at the movie's expense. The plot is an absolute rollercoaster ride of emotion, suspense, and surprise depth. The nods to the first Blade Runner are more than just fan service. They cement 2049 as not just a follow up, but an actual continuation of the previous movie's story. Even right down to the themes and concepts. There are moments here so strange, imaginative, and crazy that they could only come from the science-fiction genre and be taken seriously. There are so many fascinating aspects built into the world itself that make it feel real and worth exploring deeper. It's these futuristic anomalies and the visual splendor that kept me engaged whenever the story started to dawdle.While it is never outright boring like the first often was during it's middle act, there's little denying that some scenes simply exist for no reason other than to show off how pretty things are. 2049 does a much better job at keeping viewers interested, but still wasn't quite able to avoid the original's pacing issues. This really didn't need to be almost three hours long. There are things that could have met the chopping block or have been edited down without sacrificing the material's potency. I had to give myself an extended intermission about half way through the film because of how dang long it is. I was never not enjoying the movie, but a break felt very necessary nonetheless. Blade Runner 2049 is a beautiful, grand, and even an exhausting experience that is backed by incredible performances (Jared Leto redeems himself after Suicide Squad) and continues the Blade Runner story in ways both spectacular and moving. While it's stands very well on it's own I do recommend watching a version of the 1982 film first just to get the whole picture of why this movie is so great. Not only is it a welcome return to a world you may or may not have come into contact with 35 years ago, but it's one that manages to be even better than the first outing. Denis Villeneuve blew me away once again and I hope to see more from the Blade Runner universe in the future.8.9/10",1
391,"Will this be a cult movie along the lines of its predecessor? No. The plot simply isnt interesting or original enough for that. However it is an audiovisual treat with good performances from all actors, competent cinematography and decent pace for its length. I expected more from a sequel to one of the best scifi movies of all time, but that bar was too high to reach in the first place.",1
392,"If anything is deserving of a 10 it's this film because it perfectly achieves everything they could have wanted to achieve by making this movie and everything you could hope for as a fan of the original. It's dripping with style and weirdness and completely unafraid of taking chances and being its own animal, while still somehow maintaining a faithful nod to the spirit of the original in countless ways. I can't think of another sequel that was done this well. This will change the bar for what fans can expect from the resurrection of their favorite properties. Oh, and cinematographer Roger Deakins (nominated for an oscar 13 times but never took one home) is finally winning this year.",1
395,"I haven’t seen the original Blade Runner so I didn’t know what to expect from Blade Runner 2049. I saw it for the first time on DVD. The movie is over 2 1/2 hours long and it definitely felt like it was that long. Some long movies don’t feel as long as they actually are, but that was not the case here. Still the movie is visually stunning; and any movie that has Ryan Gosling, Jared Leto and Harrison Ford is worth watching. The women in this movie play their parts well; but by the final act the female villain is just plain annoying. I do give the movie as a whole though a B.",1
396,"If you don't think that highly of this movie, I can relate, because I didn't either after the first time I watched it. But it's amazing how everything can change with a second viewing. The plot and characterization are handled with incredible subtlety and finesse. There is just so much to unpack in each scene. Add all this to the stunning visuals and the result is a work of art that is as emotional as it is profound.",1
397,"I really want to understand the bad reviews - but... how on earth can anyone be ""bored"" by one of the most stunning cinematography of the past decade (if not since the Fellini's Rome)? Why can't some people find feelings for something as fragile as the protagonist, who is tossed in a great game and exploited at his deepest intimacy - of his own mind? I can't really find weak spots of BR2049, to me it was way more than I wanted to receive.",1
398,This film is like a good wine....slows and small sipswarms and leaves a pleasant aftertaste...,1
400,"This is an interesting case. When I got out of the cinema I would have given 10/10. Then I started thinking about the movie and it got worse. Lets start with the movie: It starts 30 years after the prequel and follows the story of Officer K (Ryan Gosling) as he hunts Replicants and makes an astonishing discovery that could shaken the world. I wont spoil the story but say they got the most out of it. Then there is the setting: They nailed it. A world where nature has died and such a miserable and hopeless place. It is an outlook to a wretched future where mankind has failed. Then there are the Replicants. I will say they created a slave race that mankind mistreated. Then I saw how they treated other humans (orphans) and will say it is not much different. For the actors: This is an amazing cast and I will praise the actors for the brilliant performance. It is like they don't act instead they became the characters. Ryan Gossling is perfect for this role. You can see his emotions and struggles. Then there is Joi played by Ana de Anmas. Her acting is equal if not a bit better than Ryan Gosslings. The performances from Jared Leto (Niander Wallace) and Sylvia Hoels (Luv) are also praiseworthy. While they have not as much screen time they nail their characters. At last there is Harrison Ford. They did him justice and use his character well (I am pointing at “The Force Awakens”). You can not rate this movie without talking about philosophies. This movie has a lot to make you think. What is the meaning of being a human? At what point is a Replicant or AI indistinguishable from a human? Are humans only biological computers? Am I the sum of my memories? What is a life worth? Should a creator have this much power over his creations? Ethics? There is a lot worth discussing with friends. Thoughts about the movie: As I thought about the movie I had following realisations: 1. The things that happen before (After Blade Runner) and after this movie (If I am reading the implications correctly) are far more interesting than this movie or lets say have more potential.2.What was archived in this movie? There is a lot of character development but what has changed in the grand picture? 3. Why did they chose this fate for Rachael and Rick? Even in a broken and hopeless world they should deserve at least a bit of a happy ending. 4. How did no one find Rick in all this years? His hiding place is good but nothing a cop, officer or bounty hunter will miss in the long run. Overall it was one of the best movies of the year and worth watching. It is sad that it made not enough money at the box office to get a sequel. Dont let my thoughts louse your enjoyment. I still give 8,5/10. Bonus knowledge: Did you know that Blade Runner and the Alien franchise share the same universe?",1
401,"I watched the original 80s blade runner film, and then this back to back, I like both movies, but I'd give the edge to BR 2049, thats not to say that the first BR is a horrible movie or anything, it was a visionary movie for it's time and had a great ending, and it's vary rare to see modern sequel get as many of the elements as right as it does and expand upon it without totally wrecking the original, I did have some criticism about what happens, but I enjoyed how they tried to keep the same flavor of the original movie it was not some total cash grab that we are used to seeing,for example you can tell the cars, and building architecture look vary much like what people would think is futuristic looking in the 80s.",1
402,"This is how you make a sequel.  Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece on so many levels.  It matches its predecessor, maintaining the overall look and feel of the universe with stunning visuals, meticulous attention to detail, and an amazing story that intrigues the viewer while deftly raising philosophical and moral questions.  Gosling, Ford, and de Armas do an outstanding job, giving Denis Villeneuve's vision the magnificence it truly deserves.",1
403,This is one of those movies with such amazing atmosphere. It is a beautiful film. It is a brilliant film. I like the score a lot. 10/10,1
406,"Spoilers ahead.Updated Nov 2019:I just finished reading Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner by Paul M. Sammon, a decent enough book although most of the book seems pretty well covered by the superb documentary ""Dangerous Days"" by Charles de Lauzirika. The book (Future Noir) was written in 2017 so everyone is all agog about the upcoming Blade Runner ""sequel"" and it's so disappointing to look back on the movie in this light. I can't even remember virtually anything ABOUT BR 2049. Apart from the awful, pointless ""fight"" between Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling.  I saw the original in 1982 and it stayed with me for years, until I saw it again on TV or VHS.  Great movies are like that, they linger and haunt you forever.  I can't imagine anyone thinking again or wanting to watch BR 2049 again as it plays on HBO or elsewhere.Yep, I own the 7 DVD European version boxed set. Yes, I saw it at the Electric Theatre in Brixton when it came out. I love the original. I wanted so much to love the sequel. Most of my peeves are listed above and below, mirrored by other reviewers with whom I have forged an unhappy bond of disappointment and disbelief. And I concur. Harrison Ford was too passive. Ryan Gosling was too dull, too toned down. Sean Young's CGI was awful. Why not have her at an age like she is now? HF is nearly 80, so how about a 55-year-old Rachel. CGI of real people is tough - it never looks real and it didn't here. The set lighting was sub-par, the CGI buildings didn't look real. This is all ""by the by"" - if there had been a real script, a real story then all would be forgiven. The movie started, for me, when Joe gets to Vegas. That's how the trailer editor saw it and that's how you should see it. Get a drink join the movie about 90 minutes in and it's really not that bad after that. Some of the stuff is great. But most of it, including the eardrum-bursting ""Music"" (which was interesting in Arrival) but here, merely serves to pretend to elicit emotion. As another viewer mentioned: when the film finished, the lights suddenly went on (this was Studio Movie Grill so they needed to clean the food trays etc.) as if the theater was embarrassed at the movie's length and wanted to shuffle us out in a hurry. There was no applause, heck even mediocre films in LA get applause since half the audience works in the industry as grips, extras, teamsters etc., even in the outskirts of town. We all just shuffled out, stunned, not quite understanding how $185 million dollars in Budapest (where they made it) could have born so little fruit. Heck, you could BUY Budapest for $185m right? ;) This seems to be a very polarizing film. Lots of critics seem to like it. My wife liked it. I hated it. I hated myself for looking forward to it. I woke up depressed. I wanted to slap the screen and say: ""That's for making me care about you!"" Wack!",0
407,"Very entertaining, good visuals and I liked the story line,  I didn't love the caring however I still found it interesting enough to keep watching, don't be picky and enjoy it for what it is, it will entertain you.",1
408,"Blade Runner 2049 es una de las mejores películas que he visto en toda mi vida y una secuela sencillamente perfecta, pese a lo larga que es para mi fue un viaje alucinante y para nada es lenta, el ritmo es constante a la hora de contar su historia y la cinematografía está en completa armonía con todo. Espero que no pase demasiado tiempo para que se estrene otra secuela porque definitivamente tiene madera suficiente para una tercera entrega.",1
409,"A worthy successor of the original Blade Runner. The story is good, the acting is also very good (specially Sylvia Hoeks), The lighting, Framing , special effects, Ambience , Music...",1
410,"Very much a boy's movie, but fun to watch just the same.  I was worried given all the hype, but the 2049 follow-up adds a little meat to the bone of the original movie, by drawing more out of the book, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, than did Ridley Scott, who essentially turned the story into a futuristic LA crime noir movie.  I thought with the update Villenueve might given women a stronger role in the future.  After all, they are the progenitors of our species.  Instead, we get a bunch of gender fun and games with lots of naked ladies blown up to the size of ""The Revenge of the 50 Foot Women,"" with Ryan Gosling left to navigate this ""Burning Man"" world in search of the truth.There are too many cliche lines for my taste, but Villenueve does try to reach for some deeper sense of meaning like he did in Arrival.  What we get is essentially a Greek tale writ large that should be seen on a 70 mm screen.  It has all the wide angle shots of its predecessor, expanding on the dreary Future World of LA. I never could understand why they set the story so near in the future given all the off-world colonies.  This is something that can only be imagined a millennia into the future.  But, maybe we will find some wormhole in the near future for Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos to exploit.Nice to see I halfway decent follow-up to the original.  I want say sequel, as I'm sure another installment is in the works.  The ending was sufficiently open ended to suggest one.",1
412,"I heard good reviews about this movie from the critics, but mixed feedback from general movie goers. So, I decided to wait for it to come out on DVD, like I do for many of the movies these days. This movie was surprisingly good and well-made. My only two complaints are that it's about 40 minutes too long and it bogs down at times. I paused the DVD at least 6 times as I went to the kitchen for beer or snacks. I am not a big Ryan Gosling fan, but he did a good job in this moviel.",1

Roger Deaking cinematography in this movie is jaw-dropping. I really don't know what to add more here, oh the original soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch it's VERY GOOD, I listen to Sea Wall at least once a day. This movie is near double the run time of the first one and it does not suffer from pacing issues at all. I love this movie, really wanted to see the 4h cut that never got released.",1

You need to be a fan of the original to understand the point of the movie! If you didn't have a chance of watching the original, than you shouldn't be watching this one! Dennis Villenauve never dissapoints you!",1
429,This is the benchmark in graphic and sound. This is nothing but a worthy sequel to one of the best movies of all times. Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece. Can't stop honor this film for his plot and the fresh approach to Blade Runner. See or die.,1
430,"Blade Runner 2049, directed by Denis Villenueve, is great at every aspect of it. With amazing acting, captivating plot, mind-blowing visuals, and ground-breaking cinematography, Blade Runner is rightfully named by many to be one of the best movies of 2017.",1
431,"The second round is big, beautiful and less selfish, for the crowds that has been cheering for so long, they did win their hearts.Blade Runner 2049Villeneuve returns the favor to the banner by first and foremost, respecting the genre and not the maker, as a result the installment is much more coherent and vocal about its perspective. Denis Villeneuve, the director, does cajole for you to reach out for the material outside the world. And through crisp clean environment, colored magnanimously and beautifully by the production design and visual effects. I'd like to draw your attention towards the enormous set pieces staged by the amazing artists working behind it.The world, as always, starts with infinite choice and hence ambiguous never-ending locations and as this case moves forwards and Ryan Gosling finds himself closer towards the answer; if there is any, the set pieces grows definite and within the questioned boundaries, to a degree, that in its last act, three is a crowd, is framed on the screen. These tiny aspects of this chapter, is what makes this film a better storyteller, than it has to say. For as far as the themes are concerned, there is a lot of seen-this-seen-that phases. And yet, with splendid cinematography and its iconic background score, the film nails a work on the wall that cannot be interpreted as anything but art.As this series has shown us, the characters are often mended as some puppets and the world they revolve around, the puppeteer. And filled with incredibly expressive details, even the behavior of the characters and the change in their perception is carried out through their surroundings. Gosling enters this franchise with a calm resilient body language and comes out from the mission shook and moved by the consequences of his action. And this action is a particularly noble one, in contrast to Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard in the previous chapter. And maybe, this is what's appealing and crowd pleasing to the audience, the hope that someone as Blade Runner, could melt down.",1
432,"The sequel that we all expected. Excellent, although inferior to the unsurpassed Blade Runner of 1982",1
433,Blade Runner 2049 reminded me of why movies are released in theaters. The scope of the sets and effects are immaculate. This is surely one of the most breathtaking films in terms of visuals.,1
434,"yeah this movie is amzing on every level it has some of the greatest cinematography ive ever seen, amzing acting, a really interesting main character who uncoveres a mystry at the same time as the audience, and while it isn't everywhere in the movie the action scenes are corigraphed very well and are some tense and suspensfull it has you on the edge of yur seat, the plot is very good and has great characters to go with it, it has an amzing soundtrack that suits the tone of the movie perfectly.tjis film also leaves the big cliff hanger of the first one untouched respecting its source material.the villan of the this movie that being jared letos character of niander Wallace is a bit weird and is present that much throuout the film but Sylvia Hoeks as luv is an wallaces assistant/personal killing machine is such an indimidating character and allways has an ominous presence through out the movie.but by far the part that steals the show is ryan goslings character of k who is so interesting and well written every timehe finds something out so do you and unravaling the mystery of the film with him is just fantastic.this film has literaly became my favorite of all time.",1
435,"It's often been said that broad trends in entertainment reflect the character of a time. Sometimes they reveal the complacency of a culture with its values, showing an idealized version of its past, or an aspirational projection of the possibilities its imperfect values could pose, if only the record could be cleansed of the historical contradictions and latent hypocrisies that fester within. Other times have turned their attention to the hypocrisy itself, to uglier details that stood in the way of perfection.We belong to a time that is at once infantilized by a surface culture where adults are permanently marketed to as children, yet they are also abandoned by systems and institutions to whom they must pay alms (in the numbing hours sacrificed to day jobs, and in taxes demanded by a malfunctioning government) they are no longer the constituency. What is there to hope for when the very prospect of affecting meaningful change seems impossible?Today we bear the pale complexion of an era drained of any vision of what is beyond itself. We didn't envision this as the future, and on the horizon are only more grim portents. The culture has given up on imagining something better, and has receded into the corpse of nostalgia.",0
436,I was not the biggest fan of the first but this one is fantastic and my new favorite Denis Villeneuve film. **** perfect,1
437,"t is rare to see a movie that gets a sequel 30 years later but what is more rare is to see a sequel that not only expands on what you loved about the first but could actually be better than the first.That's right this movie is better than the first one.Without going too much into the story as this movie is best enjoyed without knowing any of the twist and turns. Ryan Gosling plays ""K"" the new Blade Runner whose job is to hunt down Replicants but one mission leads him to discover a revelation. The story is honestly amazing and you discover revelations with ""K"" making you more invested in the film. Do you need to watch the first Blade Runner to understand the story? Not necessarily but the film is much better is you do.The cast are phenomenal especially Ryan Gosling performance as ""K"" in which he can be emotionless yet emotive at the same time. Where the scene needs him to be fully emotive Ryan Gosling pulls it off perfectly and makes you feel for his character. Harrison Ford also returns as Deckard from the first movie and while his appearance in this movie is a lot shorter than the marketing makes you think, he still gives a surprisingly great performance and could be considered his best in some time. The rest of the cast are amazing as well with a special mention to Ana de Armas as Joi and Sylvia Hoeks as Luv being great standouts. Jared Leto gives a great performance though could be considered the most jarring one but for me didn't break my immersion from the movie.The music score is absolutely stunning which is done by Hans Zimmer who I consider a legend in making music Scores. The director Dennis Villeneuve creates some amazing camera shots that are a mix of practical and CGI. The shot themselves are like an artwork and are just stunning to look at. Blade Runner 2049 isn't just a typical cash-in sequel, it actually expands on what you loved about the original and more. This film doesn't decide to just turn Blade Runner into an action movie franchise either, while the movie does have some great action scenes they are short and little at best. The director made a proper Blade Runner sequel that stands on its own. It's visually gorgeous with an immersive story and a stunning score.You could call this movie an achievement in film-making and should be watched by fans or newcomers alike.",1
438,"In essence, Denis Villeneuve's 'Blade Runner 2049' aims to up the ante on its original film. Everything is taken to a larger and broader scale. And this, most of the time, is a good thing. It improves upon all the technical elements and directorial techniques of the original, although losing a bit of focus in the process.Overall, though, this is a really pretty film. Thanks, in a very large part to legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins' bold imagery and cutting edge luxurious filming techniques; but also thanks to Villeneuve's directorial chops. He borrows, from the original film, the method of presenting us a world drowned in gigantic buildings, surrounded by choking industrialism filled with commercials to gigantic brands and sexual fantasies. It succeeds in building on the idea of showing us a utopic life beyond the slums of Earth and brilliantly creates a personal story with bold plot twists. And like the imagery and the futuristic and roaring soundtrack, the story revolves around hope.The characters, like 'K' (Ryan Gosling), the silent and collected blade runner, Joshi (Robin Wright) the imposing Police Chief and most others are emptied of feelings and there is a certain coldness between them. This is not an issue, but an observation, as this emotional separation reflects perfectly the tone of the film. Sure, there are a few characters which offer more emotion, like Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is the most human character of them all and also has his own personal motives and regrets. And then there is Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), a powerful CEO of a company making a new generation of replicants; although he looks imposing, his appearances are not only brief, but his character comes along as pretentious, constantly babbling in a Shakespearean manner about his goals and motives.Despite this slightly wasted villain and pacing which could have been sped up on certain occasions, making this film a bit shorter, 'Blade Runner 2049' is a beautifully designed experiment in the philosophy of futurism; ideas like the humanity of machines and even a few ironic references to virtual reality. Of course, we've heard these all before, but this really does not matter when you have such a brilliant execution.",1
439,"Let me get perhaps one of the best elements of this film out of the way, the visuals. The visuals in this film are amazing. This movie is worth watching just because of the visuals. The acting is also amazing, Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor. But this film feels over stuffed and might have been better as a tv show because there were so many plot lines and characters that it was overwhelming. There was so much going on that when the big reveal happened I didn't care because there was no setup. This movie also felt weirdly pretentious. Overall this movie was well made and had great acting.",1
440,"Bless Runner 2049 was epicly satisfying, better than the original. Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself to be one of the best modern directors. With immaculate and incredible cinematography by Roger Deakins (14 nominations, 1 wins) . The soundtrack was loud and mesmerizing. Great action sequences dispite not being an action flick.Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford were bad ass af, the cast was exceptional as the visuals.

441,"it just feels so realperfect-est movie ive ever seen, beautiful in every way. it just might be a little atmosphere based and abstract for some people. oh and also that it was a little too long lol",1
442,"Blade Runner 2049 successfully does what many sequels fail to do in taking the original film, Blade Runner, and building it up. Blade Runner 2049 takes the same world, themes, and characters and makes them more fleshed out. Blade Runner 2049 is especially remarkable because it manages to capture the spirit of the original while coming out over three decades later. Blade Runner 2049 is still a thrilling and invigorating experience for those unfamiliar with the Blade Runner universe. Villeneuve’s style is especially apparent with this entry. The shot composition and especially the cinematography allow for grandiose worldbuilding. Gosling and Ford both portray similar characters, Deckard and ‘K’ respectively, but represent the duality of their world. Where ‘K’ falls short, Deckard’s legacy picks up the ball. Bladerunner 2049 has so many intricacies and subtleties to it that it remains present in the viewer’s mind long after its initial watch.",1
443,"I've always thought Blade Runner was a bit overrated, granted you can't take a single cinema class without talking about Shape, Line, form and movement, but at the same time it presents us with some of the deepest and conflicting arguments and topics of conversation I personally have ever come across. 2049 is no different. I watched Blade Runner 2049 in the hopes of seeing something new brought to the world of ""Group 'X' has no rights and needs to be eliminated."" And the change brought here is so much more than ""Cloned humans are not human,"" But instead ""Cloned Humans can be MORE human than humans."" The concept behind the films biggest plot device; the Replicant from the first film ""Rachael"" giving birth to a human child, serves as a shock to the viewer that there very well may come a time where we need to look inside ourselves and see what we'd be willing to do to hide such a secret. Or even more than that, whether or not we could even consider that child to be human. In a world where the hot topic is political Refugees or Immigration, surely there will come a time in the near future where this franchise is used as a tool to argue that perhaps we're not as evolved as we like to consider.",1

446,"I have to admit, I am not a huge fan of the original Blade Runner. It was an alright movie, but I found it to be a relatively simple sci-fi movie. So when Blade Runner 2049 was announced, I knew I'd go see it but I wasn't extremely excited or anything. But when I walked out of the theater after seeing it, I was raving about it for a few weeks.I just love everything about this movie. The incredible visuals, the complex story, the minimal but effective dialogue...everything. The only thing that I guess I don't like is the length. You can definitely feel that this is a two-hour and forty-four minute movie, but it's so good that I can dismiss that as a very small gripe. Dennis Villeneuve directed a sci-fi movie that I actually like more than most of the Star Wars movies, which is something I never thought I'd say. Unfortunately, we'll probably never see another Blade Runner movie since this one underperformed big time at the box office, but at least we got this one.",1
447,"Blade Runner 2049 continues to blow my mind with every viewing. This film is remarkable. A true sci-fi classic that excels in real film sets that inspire actual cinema. My eyes are refreshed every time I look at a frame from this movie. This is the best looking movie I have ever seen. The script continues to entertain me. The deep and intimate struggles that K and Deckard face feel real and compelling, just like their performances in this film. Truly one of the best movies I've ever seen, and my second favorite of all time.100/100",1

453,"The sequel serves as the antithesis of the first film. While the first movie raised the question of reality, the sequel encourages us to believe in it. To stop debugging abstractions and start creating and strengthening them until they become reality. Given the doubts of postmodernism there are the lights that illuminate the reality of spiritualism. And the movie encourages us to find each other. A masterpiece.",1

456,"(Originally written on 10/9/17) I finally got to see my most anticipated film of 2017, Blade Runner 2049, and it was as amazing, if not better than I thought it was going to be. Denis Villeneuve has proven himself yet again to be a master of filmmaking. My favorite movie of last year, Arrival, was also directed by him, and he has directed my favorite film of this year so far, Blade Runner 2049. This movie is a masterpiece on all levels, especially in terms of cinematography and special effects. There is not a single shot in this movie that I didn’t believe, or say “oh that’s CGI.” The CGI in this movie is not very noticeable and looks extremely realistic, and the cinematography is even better. This may be the most well shot film I have ever seen. The lighting is perfect, the color pallet is perfect, the shot length is perfect, the shot composition is perfect. If Roger Deakins does not win for best cinematography this year (after recieving 13 nominations and 0 wins for the other films he was involved in), I will be extremely disappointed. Another thing I have to commend this film for is for the realism of it’s universe. Just like the first Blade Runner, which I also love, it’s universe feels incredibly real. I feel like I can step inside the universe right now, and trust me, I would love to visit this universe (but not live there because it is very dark and depressing). If any film displays how movies can take you places, it would be Blade Runner 2049. As for the acting, it is pretty damn good. Ryan Gosling is more emotionally reserved in this movie than in others, for a reason that is told near the beginning of the film, and he was very grounded and believable in this film. Harrison Ford was also great even though he is not in the movie much. Jared Leto is also very good and very bizarre and creepy as “Wallace.” Everyone is great in this movie. The score is also great and I am very happy that Hans Zimmer paid tribute to Vangelis’ very haunting and beautiful score from the first Blade Runner. The sound design was also fantastic and very realistic. Every single aspect of this movie was great. Blade Runner 2049 is definitely my favorite movie this year and it gets an A+",1
457,"The best movie of 2017. The soundtrack is even better that the first one, the scenario is awesome, the visual effects are excellent ... The movie is not perfect, but it's a masterpiece, without any doubt. You liked the first one ? You'll love this sequel !",1

460,"Me gusta mucho más todo el universo y la ambientación del clásico de 1982, pero esta gana en gran medida en otros muchos apartados, como personajes mil veces más carismáticos e interesantes, la dirección de la acción y una trama mucho más elaborada. Mantiene un universo espectacular, al igual que la música, pero creo que no a la altura de la obra original de Ridley Scott.Gosling funciona de manera sorprendente y de nuevo da un golpe en la mesa quitándose todos los prejuicios que le llevan asignando durante años. Película muy disfrutable (especialmente para los fans del género de ciencia ficción) y muy recomendada.",1

466,"Blade Runner was a film that I thought was... okay. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. I thought it was a decent sci-fi movie. So, going into the sequel, I didn't expect much. Boy, was I wrong. The acting is amazing. The effects are beautiful. The story is magnificent. The world that these films created is awesome.I didn't know what the story was going to be going into this movie. The trailers didn't tell me much. So, I was very surprised while watching the movie. The movie is almost 3 hours long, but I was never bored. I was constantly intrigued, wanting to know what was going to happen next. I cared about the characters. I assumed the movie would end the way they were setting things up to be, but it didn't (if you have seen the film, you know what I mean). That, I think, is really cool. The movie ends the way you don't expect it to. It took a risk, and succeeded.This is an amazing work of art, from the writing, to the directing, to the acting, and to the effects. I highly recommend this film.",1
467,"This is a worthy successor to the original Blade Runner film. It was clever, exciting, and gorgeous.",1
468,"I really think it is the best movie ever. Silent, calm and whenever required - dynamic. Music in the film like meditation.",1
469,"This is the first time I've come out of a movie wishing I could have seen the producer's cut. You know, the way we normally see movies. Where the director's tendency to get too artsy is tempered by the necessities of expedience and concise storytelling and budget. It was visually stunning of course, with many memorable scenes and good performances. But the plot, not the writing, is by far the weakest element. And while it would be fun to dissect every stupid point (replicant procreation as the McGuffin; replicants who obey despite the lack of any substantial control mechanism; evil torture that can only for some reason happen off world so that Harrison has the chance to be rescued in transit), the real, core problem is the bad guy.And the real, core problem with the bad guy is that he's bad. The key that held the original all together was the complete absence of evil - the full and total surrender to and embrace (narratively) of dystopia. In a proper dystopia, a truly depressing one, there are no bad guys. Everyone's just in it for themselves, trying to survive, trying to make the right choice if that's even possible. In the original we are misled into thinking anyone could be the bad guy: cops, replicants, the genius Tyrell, even hyper-objectified Rachel maybe? And they all just turn out to be self-involved and surviving, one way or another. Until ultimately we find out, if there was a bad guy at all, it's our hero: running around killing soon-to-die-anyway, often brilliant, and generally peaceful replicants as part of a full on genocide. There are no good choices, no right decisions in a proper dystopia. The whole system is broken and the only appropriate final response is depression and escape if possible. And the good stories about these dystopias are about the impossibility of behaving morally in these worlds, how our protagonists deal with it and either do or don't find small victories within the larger perpetual defeat. It's compelling emotionally, relatable to in our real and generally uncaring world, and wonderfully fertile ground for great storytelling.What the new Blade Runner does is give us a bad guy. And not just a bad guy looking for profit, or power - not only.  No. This guy is creepy, properly evil, kills one of his own wholly innocent and palpably afraid creations just to add emphasis to his evil speech (to himself basically - how's that for forced exposition?) about how desperately he is incapable of producing birth capable replicants. He is pure evil, he looks, smells, breathes evil. He has evil eyes and evil floating cameras attached to an evil port on his evil neck. He enjoys the suffering of others and wants to build a galaxy full of slaves. His evil minion is, again, repeatedly and unnecessarily and unbelievably just pure hateful evil. Our villain here is all one color. And being all black, he by necessity makes Gosling all white.And, seriously, how boring is this guy - our hero? He basically just slowly mopes around all over the place, emoting real hard - when he isn't running through walls or shooting stuff (people, things, replicants... who cares). He has a digital girlfriend that he can't touch, and everything about both of them reads as uncaring of each other, but the plot says love is there, so let's just pretend. And how infuriating are the vagaries of how tough or strong, exactly, is this thing? He can run full speed through a concrete wall no problem, but gets knocked out by a mild crash. He can't beat evil minion chick until after he's mortally wounded and floating in water with her - suddenly stronger than the thing that 30 seconds ago was handing him his ass. All that stuff's just lazy.But anyway, perhaps this might have worked as some simple morality tale à la Snow White - pure hero, rotten villain, love conquers all in the end. Except the story is so convoluted, unclear, and above all stretched out for miles - even the morality tale that might have been is lost in the susurrus. Love does, kind of, conquer all in the end, but it's got pretty much squat to do with the fake human with borrowed memories we've been watching wandering around all this time.  Deckard thought he was human, so he was human. Joe (Gosling) knows he's a fancy robot, so he's a fancy robot. But the most damaging effect of the simple evil/good dynamic here is that there is no doubt, no uncertainty. Ultimately it makes caring about anyone or anything in this story impossible. It's just something you can watch happen, predictably. Our bad guy will exclusively do horrible things. Our good guy will exclusively do noble things.  You expect this from a Transformers movie. You don't expect this from a story in the lineage of Philip K. Dick. Who wasn't even all that great of a writer, just an absolutely astounding world-builder. The foundations of that world were transferred to the original Blade Runner, and that's why it worked. They were ignored in this sequel, and that's why it doesn't work.",0
470,"The film makers in trying to create a new world on screen have created a new world of film making off screen. This film has elevated every aspect of the art form, from directing to visual effects, sound editing to acting.This is an extremly long film with a muted story but my eyes did not wander off screen, I was never not entertained and I truly felt amazed seeing this incredible work on a big screen. I know this film got recognition by the academy but I think the best recognition this film has received is its influence on modern day culture, storytelling and pop culture. The popularity of cyber punk has been looming under the surface with fashion and manga's, however, Blade Runner 2049 propelled this genre into a highly realised and modern genre that would cement itself as one of the most successful genres of modern day films.This film is very much rewatchabe despite its extreme running time and every single name that featured on the rolling credits deserves a lot of compliments for what has been achieved here.",1

Through strong plot, reasonable world development, and a series of philosophical questions that flow smoothly as story dimensions, this successful film success becomes not only one of the best sequels - it can stand alone, not depend on other films - but also the best films ever existed.",1
476,"Après le succès de blade runner 1 Dennis Vilneuve reviens après le magnifique Arrival, au cinéma avec un film encore meilleur que le film de Ridley Scott. Ryan Gosling et Harrison Ford forme un exelent duo. L’intoduction du film est l’une des meilleur de tout l’histoire du cinéma. La musique donne des frisson. Je suis aller voir le film le jour de ça sorti au cinéma en imax cela dois avoir eu un impacte sur mon avis du film. Les scène dans la ville avec la brume orangé sont parfette enfète tout les scène du film sont parfaite.",1
477,"While some of the scenes in this movie are a little too brooding and long it provides a great and creative CG not seen in other movies. The casting and acting is superb. Would have liked to see of Leto's character, Wallice developed more instead of the overly long 'Elvis' scene in Vegas and others. Leto was great at portraying what little of this character we see. As it is his character is too disjointed and sketchy to make much sense. There is a depth there that just wasn't developed.",1
478,"A masterpiece and I already knew it before they shot the first frame. This is a Denis Villeneuve film, and anybody versed with the man's filmography will realize that this is an artist of the highest order. Had Blade Runner been given to anybody- even Ridley, I can guarantee you the final result wouldn’t be half as good as what we see here. Ryan Gosling takes over the role played by Harrison Ford in the 1982 original and he essays an effortlessly cool protagonist living in the future of decay and destitute. Harrison Ford is also back in a glorified cameo but its glad to see the old man back in this Universe. The special effects are amazing with a careful mixture of carefully rendered CGI and practical effects. The film looks fantastic, but it is the plot that is the heart and soul of this great film. You should go and watch Blade Runner before seeing 2049 and then come and marvel at this masterpiece. One of the best recent science fiction films.(Denis Villeneuve has created a masterpiece).",1
479,"Visualmente lindo. O enredo é rico e apresenta diálogos interessantes. As reflexões são validas, ainda mais pra nossa geração, e não devem passar batidas para a total compreensão do filme e, consequentemente, aproveitamento dele.",1
481,I never thought that my favorite Movie of all Time is gonna be this one. Just everything in this just Clicks for me. The Acting the beautiful Pictures and the overall Story is just Perfect. For some People the Movie is to Slow but i didn't mind it because the World of Blade Runner managed to Catch me. I had no hope that it would be better than the Original but i personally find it is. Its is not your average Hollywood sequel. This Movie is what i call an Masterpiece.,1
483,"Being a fan of 'Do Androids...' I picked this up on a whim and was absolutely flabbergasted. It is one of the most spellbindingly immersive and atmospheric films ever put to tape. The cinematography is first class, as is the acting (I even managed to like Jared Leto). It is the most staggeringly brilliant films I have ever seen.",1
484,Blade Runner 2049 is is an amazing sci-fi masterpiece and my favorite movie of 2017. It is phenomenal movie that left me completely stunned and wanting to watch it again almost immediately. I want to watch this film over and over again.,1
485,"This film is a work of art. Stunning images, fantastic sound design and beautiful colors. The story was mysterious and the time was taken to tell it at a good pace.",1
486,True fans will get this film and I can't get enough of it. Ryan goslin portrays his character so we'll that you can't keep your eyes off the screen. I love this film because it is simply art every time I watch it.,1
487,"Es una película muy completa y compleja, con un guión bien estructurado y con muchas interrogantes pero sin respuestas fáciles. Es lenta, sí pero esto construye el ambiente. Si te gustó la primera esta te encantará pues es todo lo que una secuela debe ser.",1
488,This is a different and beautifully broken world. It takes it's time to set you up for the ride. Many praise the movie for it's visuals but the depth and realism of the concepts is what really elevates it to the next level.,1
489,"My favorite movie of the decade. For my, everything fits in ""Blade Runner 2049"". The soundtrack, the acting, the story. I really don't know anything to complain about. I definitely have to see it again.",1
490,"This is a beautiful movie and it captures the essence of what the first movie was about. It does so in a different way, and does so with heart.",1
491,"While for the most part superior to the original, it's at least 30 minutes too long, and the ending is underwhelming.",1
492,"A+, One of the best sequels ever, brilliant on all levels. ",1
493,"As if its predecessor was watered down and bland. Nice story, but there where too many events. While Blade Runner wins by K. O.  Blade Runner 2077 wins by points. Most of the times is nicer to watch a well execute K. O than a prolongued 12 round fight, especialy if you aren't a boxing expert. .",1
494,"A cinematic masterpiece. Excellent storyline, simple ideas yet captivating. Acting is as expected from Gosling and Ford. Villenue’s direction accompanied by Deakins’ cinematography and Wallfisch/Zimmer score truly make this film the classic finish to a riveting franchise.",1
496,"Real rating: 79/100What happens when you pump millions into a film that will not make it back in theatres. The obvious answer is that you market it as something it is not. This is a standard practice in cinema, and it does nothing but exploit viewers and upend the general public's views of a particular film. Which destroys the ability of artistic directors to follow their vision, and it has always made me wonder if it would be at all possible to have two versions of a film in theatres at the same time. You could have a studio cut of the movie in those 64 screen multiplexes and in the indie theatres, where they serve spiced tea and apples behind the counter, you could have a director's cut because at the moment this ploy of marketing an arthouse flick as an action movie is doing no one any favours.​DE: The directing is superb, though that has become a standard for Villeneuve. However, unlike his other films, this one draws on its shots for far too long and you could certainly feel like the editor could have stepped in a cut a good 10 minutes of this film and still leave that lingering desolation feeling. It almost feels like Villeneuve was trying to mimic Stalker in his approach, but unlike Stalker, the lingering shots feel inauthentic as in Stalker we are meant to be contemplating existence, religion, purpose, but in 2049 we are sitting at the heart of a mystery that feels like we are not trying to solve.​W: The dialogue is decent, yet a little clunky and on the nose. And sadly that is the best part of it. Though I am not shocked Hampton Fancher, the man who penned the original script is back, however in the subsequent 25 years he has written nothing of note, so obviously the studio brings in the standard scriptwriter in the guise of Michael Green, who did pen Logan but also penned Alien: Covenant and the much-maligned Green Lantern. This combination leaves us with a film that barely has a plot and does not delve into anything of note. However, it does likely explain why Villeneuve structured the film the way he did and why there are so many drawn-out shots.​C: This is so beautifully shot that it should be taught in schools and, sadly, this film was Deakins's first Oscar out of 13 noms, though his second would come with the gorgeous 1917. His use of the camera and understanding of a shot is fantastic, and if one sees the rest of his works, they can see a shift in style for this film, and while those long lingering shots may be a pain for the storyteller visually, they are perfect representations of what you are trying to get across. The mood and notion are there in every frame. The angles and shadows that are being cast on Gosling throughout the film speak volumes. The special effects, while excellent, do not feel genre-defining or like 25 years have passed since the original. ​A: Ford cannot act at a level beyond a 6, and that is fine. He is there because he has to be. Gosling's muted touch was decent enough though I worry he is going to get typecast as wooden if he keeps on the path he currently is on. Sylvia Hoeks, one would assume was hired for her visual aesthetic rather than her ability to emote, which if this was Tarrantino flick, I think she would have worked. But in this nuanced, subtle drawn-out film her character comes off cartoonish. I was incredibly impressed with Ana de Armas and found her performance soulful yet understated. The mechanical I am saying what I suppose to yet am still a creature with almost a concept of feelings really elevates Goslings numbed performance.​S: I would have scored this higher if I had not seen Arrival, whereas the industrial style sound design should have been more engaging. I could not help feeling they were reusing it. Of course, the sounds were meant to be jarring given all the silence we were fed, but ultimately it feels like that opening sequence in the remake of Funny Games, it is not shocking or grating in the sense the creator wants, but more in the sense, please turn down the TV those noises are starting to give me a headache.PD: The PD in this film was quite good, the sets feel real and lived in. Especially the opening sequence. Rebuilding on a franchise that is famous for its visual effects and the PD is not easy, but they were able to meet a standard that has been heralded for decades. Dennis Gassner did well here as is expected. He has almost always been brought in when you need a world that feels distant, yet somehow still retains elements of the one we live in. See his work in the Truman Show, Big Fish and 1917 for this.BA: Well done throughout, especially Leto's character, though I will say the only real negative was Wright's outfit. What is this 2049 and she is channelling the 50's or was she literally a copy of the police chief from Futurama? Also, Ford's entire presence was uninspired.",1
