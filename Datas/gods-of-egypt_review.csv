0,"Right now let's agree on some basic beliefs. Egypt is in Africa. That does not mean that everyone one in Africa has dark skin. Is that really how far people have fallen. Right away, we stereotype all African's as black. How absurdly incorrect. The movie was well balanced, it's the circumstances that are elsewhere that are effecting this movie.This movie was a fun ride, and for some it is exactly what some people were looking for. The story was put into place, and you can find a excellent villain in Butler. The acting was light, but not without it's darker moments. The vision was exceptional in how far they wished to push the boundaries of storytelling. The movie was well paced, with an epic climax. Maybe everyone is not going to like it. Still you can guarantee yourself that everyone will remember it.",1
1,"I'm not sure why this has so many low scores. Especially for ""all of the gods being white"". There was actually a black god, I guess they watched a different movie than I did. The only thing I did not like about this movie is some of the romance scenes and some of the CGI wasn't very believable and for lack of a better phrase, ""Gay looking"".  This movie is action packed, and the story is pretty solid. I'm going to have to give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, because it was clearly above 5, which is what I consider to be average. I'm going to give it a 10 on metacritic to balance all of these people who aren't able to see the black god of wisdom.",1
2,"I seriously don't understand what's all the hate for this movie. Its a well-crafted, quality, entertaining piece of art. Other than the typical Egyptian myth, magic and romance, it has interesting new ideas that were well-flashed out. I won't go into details for fear of giving away the plot lines, but safe to say that its got a touching romance story, likable & lovely/macho characters, impressive CGI effects and good pacing with enough action to satisfy. I love it! Better than many other Egyptian movies.",1
3,"I watched this after seeing the trailer and reviews first so I expected a really dull experience. Instead of that I got a decent amount of fun, the movie is far from terrible how many describe it. Yes, some bad acting here and there but not that bad. Good story, action, cast, effects also not as bad as they say etc. I gave it a 10 because of the unjustly low average score, otherwise I'd give it a 7.",1
4,"Look, I can't say this was a thought-through, well directed gem (because a couple of their facts are wonky),but it was genuinely enjoyable. I gotta give it credit for its stunning graphics, because the movie looks amazing. All in all, I thought it was really entertaining, and it's beautiful the whole way through. Isn't that what movies are about?",1
5,"I went into this movie with pretty low expectations. I rented it from the library so there was absolutely no cost for me other than time spent watching the movie. I have to say it wasn't terrible. The CGI effects are outdated, but other than that it was ok. Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau both do excellent jobs. Brenton Thwaites is utterly forgettable as Bek. Everyone else does a fine job as secondary background characters. The movie is entertaining rather than a work of art. I enjoyed this much more than I did Suicide Squad, Batman vs. Superman, or heck even Civil War. I think the movie took an inordinate amount of flak because the lead characters were white and there were cries of ""white washing."" For the record 1) classical Egyptians (or modern ones for that matter) were never black. 2) Egypt was conquered by Alexander the Great so a large chunk of Egyptian rulers (e.g. Cleopatra) were actually of Greek decent (i.e. white). I mean should more of the actors have been brown or Mediterranean hued? Sure. Is that what should define a movie? Not really. Judge it on its merits.",1
6,"Pretty good adventurous mythical movie about ancient Egypt, with some cool effects, good and bad heroes and characters and the whole Egyptian mythology displayed on screen (maybe slightly altered, but ok). It was fun to watch and I think my 2 hours were well spent. Why the negativity, people ? What did you expect, a social drama ? Read the title before going to the cinema...",1

9,"This is a good movie.  The acting was good,the pacing was rushed at some parts (for example, when Jamie Lanisterreluctantly gave the man-cub the bejeweled bracelet-- there should have been a pause there;he should've looked conflicted for more than half a second, which is what we see--if I were giving the mortalmy deceased girlfriend's bracelet, it would move me for at least a few seconds). This movie has both plot and character development.Leonidas was blood-thirsty, so I did not like him at all. I think many of the low reviews come from Christianswho watch the film and suddenly realized that their religion wasn't as original or uniqueas they thought.  I guess they missed the part in the Bible where god mentions other gods.",1
10,"Just watched it on Blu-ray - had to wait until now since it was repeatedly delayed. Was supposed to be shown in the cinemas here, but at the last moment they changed their minds, pulling it. Too bad, I would have loved to watch it in 3D.I think it's a great movie in the vein of ""Flash Gordon"" (1980). Funny and doesn't take itself too seriously.",1
11,This movie is fantastic! A good thing beying Wronged. I just loved the whole filme because it has a big story and chains us from the start to the end.,1
12,"I am astounded at the bad reviews. The movie was very entertaining and well done, the images stunning, better than many sci-fi movies. Perhaps the reviewers are Christian or Muslim bigots trying to suppress this movie (all religions are fantasy bigotry meant to control the masses). I was glued to the screen for the entire time. I even cried over parts that touched my heart. I will see it again and again since it is now on my list of favorites.",1
13,"I don't usually write reviews but this one definitely deserve it, I don't care who was playing it, how much budget it was thrown into, as long as the movie is great, I'm satisfied. For fantasy movie lovers, ever since LOTR and Avatar nothing ever came close. The special effects might make u roll your eyes a bit but it definitely doesn't deserve the hate. Go watch for yourself and decide.",1
14,I  honestly don't know what people are complaining about. I absolutely enjoyed this movie. I just finished watching it and I  could watch it again right now. I thought it was very well done. I love egyptian mythology movies and there is such a small amount of them  done in this genre that I found this very welcoming. Boo to all the haters! Go and watch your boring reality crap if you can't take this at the entertainment value presented to you. You're probably the same kind of haters that bag out Stargate!,1
15,"I had to see this film because it was directed by Alex Proyas, one of my favorite directors.  Although the movie is certainly not a classic, it isn't as bad as the reviews indicate.  I was never bored and I thought the special effects fit the tone of the film.  All the actors seemed to be into the movie, especially Gerard Butler and Brenton Thwaites.  I also enjoyed Geoffrey Rush as ""Ra"" the sun God.  I felt that the movie was trying to capture the spirit of some of the old classics like ""Clash of the Titans"", and for me it succeeded on that level.",1
16,"I found the movie very entertaining and don't really understand why it gets so many bad reviews. It's a fun mix of mythology, action and fantasy. Some great visuals and epic scenes, one of my favourites beeing Ra's fight upon the sun barque against the god of darkness and chaos Apophis! I could imagine that the CGI could maybe look a bit unrealistic or cheesy on a normal screen, but seeing it in 3D on the big screen it actually looked rather convincing and cool. And it's not easy to display gods and their epic fights in a way that does them justice without getting too over the top. Gerard Butler is allways fun to watch, and the others are doing ok. Some lines are cheesy, but overall the characters are likeable. Script and story are ok too. I liked the way they portraied the gods. Wielding terrible power, but not almighty, and rather human like in character. More entertaining and closer to the mythological source material than other movies like Clash of the Titans, or Thor. And yes they cast white actors (among others) to play egyptian gods which is not ideal, but understandable. If europeans can deal with a black Heimdal in Thor (you know, the god that is literally called ""the whitest of the Aesir"" and ""the white As"" in the source mythology), egyptians should be able to handle a white Horus. Hey at least Toth was black and Anubis was a Jackal. What more do you want? ;)",1
17,"When I first watched this, i kept on thinking about all the negative critiques it got. After i had seen it, none of them seemed to matter. This movie will never be Oscar worthy, or a great literary masterpiece but it is fun and entertaining. Watching movies isn't always about deep thinking, or, epiphanies, sometimes it is just about having fun, and the actors above all, give us that.",1
18,"Wow, so much hate for this movie? Did I missing something? Did the director shoot a panda in real life of something? Honestly, the movie was fun to watch. Over the top? Crazy? Elaborate? Sure. But did any of you go into the movie expecting otherwise? I loved the sets and the animations were fun. The back and forth was enjoyable too. For those of you expecting a documentary about Egypt, or a Shawshank redemption heart puller, can I ask what made you expect either?",1
19,"I watched it with no expectations due to the fact that I always make an average between critics reviews and user reviews. This movie was super fun, good action , interesting story, yeah there are some cheesy parts what I asume you expect it as the movie is a fiction, action -adventure title. I say give it a chance , I liked it .",1
20,I made the mistake of not going to see this in the theater due to the horrible reviews.  Huge mistake on my part.  My son & I absolutely loved this movie when we watched it tonight.  Extremely entertaining and well crafted.  We loved the overall storyline and smirked at the humorous areas.  The special effects were well done though a little heavy at times.  Loved the actors. Overall nicely done.  Going to watch it again tomorrow.,1
21,"This is a solid entertaining movie that is getting way too much hate for asinine reasons. The effects are very good most of the time, while unfortunately falling short during some scenes. The story is fine for an epic popcorn style movie, yet again, a few scenes show through where the acting falls short. If you look past these shortcomings and come in with a positive attitude and don't expect anything intellectually groundbreaking - this movie is totally fine. It's probably the best Egyptian themed movie you're going to see for a new few years. Ignore the critics and just watch it for yourself.",1
22,"I don't see why there's so much hate for this movie. It was clearly meant to be little more than a green-screen action spectacle, but this one leans heavily on its mythological elements, which some will enjoy more than others. The action ranges from so-so (obviously green-screen pyramid fight scene) to cool (magical babes riding giant flame-throwing cobras) to incredible (anything with Ra and the hell monster). I'm guessing that a lot of the negativity is a result of the writing. It's true, the dialogue is lacking and there are several cheesy lines, but the benefit of the fast-paced script is that it conveys the solid world-building clearly. The story moves at a good pace, and the characters are likable and act in ways that make sense. None of the main characters do anything stupid, and the villain doesn't make dumb decisions. So that's already an improvement over most films of this genre. I want to believe in this world and I would like to see sequels with these characters but unfortunately due to this film having an estimated disappointing performance, that doesn't seem to be likely. The only things worth complaining about are a lack of a memorable script and the very green-screen look, which is a result of everything being shot and lit a little too perfectly and being comped into backgrounds that can resemble a very well-rendered PS4 game. I am a big fan of director Alex Proyas' ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"". This is not his best work but I definitely think it's being overly thrashed. If you enjoyed ""Prince of Persia"" and ""Clash of the Titans"", you'll probably enjoy this, too.",1
23,"I never write reviews on metacritic. However I felt I had to balance out  all the hate this movie is receiving. The movie is pretty good, it is something different and visually stunning imo. Don't listen to the critics , just rent it and see for yourself.",1
24,"Don't go into this movie expecting an accurate, scientific study of Egypt and Egyptian lore.  This is just meant to be a fun, action-packed visual thrill ride against the backdrop of a mythical Egypt.  The visual effects were imaginative and spectacular.  The action scenes are paced well. This movies main weakness is character development.  The main character seems like a super-human homeless person, which doesn't make much sense.  Of course, it's hard to feel for the Gods, because, well, they're Gods with precious few flaws to make them relate-able. If you just want to turn your brain off and see action, near death escapes, and creative visual effects, this is the movie for you.",1
25,"This movie is terrible, it really is!  This movie, however, makes a really good guilty pleasure movie, it's mindless entertaining and laughable in a really horrible way!!!",1
26,"I don't know why all these reviews are so bad when me and my mother saw it in 3d and we both thought it was good.  I would say it's about as good as 300 part 2.  I would give it a 10 but I'm an honest reviewer and there is always something that can be improved upon so the only movie I would give a 10 to would be a movie that absolutely blows me away and does everything perfectly.  People who give this a score lower than a 6 can absolutely be disregarded as bias and comparing it to a movie that they think it should be.  Graphics are amazing in 3d, the story is pretty good and I couldn't find anything wrong with the movie as a whole.  I watched a video review of this movie before I went to see it and it was giving it a bad rating, then I came to this website to see what the review was and also got a bad rating so I had to go see it myself and now I am baffled by these ratings because it is actually not near as bad as everyone is saying.",1
27,"This movie was pretty fun to watch. No the CGI wasn't perfect, and no the mythology wasn't followed strictly, but who said it was supposed to? This is another fun action movie with some touching bits thrown in every now and then. If you like action movies, I would say go see it. It isn't as action heavy as London has Fallen, but it is still fun nonetheless. I do feel like it got a bit too long in the tooth by the end of the running time, it felt like it could have ended maybe 15 or 25 minutes earlier.",1
32,Borderline cornball classic. Lots and lots of delicious eye candy. Don't dismiss this movie due to poor critic response. There is an outer space scene. A dozen crazy monster like characters. Multiple super silly love stories. Action galore. Glee inducing dumb dialogue. If they could have just committed to being a screwball movie this would have been a classic. You might want to see this movie. You will almost surely be entertained.,1
33,"This movie suuuuuucks. How can they spend this much money for this much suck? Just wait until it shows up on netflix and then just make sure you never click on it.",0
34,"This movie is getting slaughtered only to the overly pedantic.Currently in theaters, there is nothing else that will give you that ultimate fantasy / battle feel.This movie oozes 'God of War' and while the CGI at times looks cheap, it is a rather fun, interesting and action packed narrative.I never felt bored at any point during the film. It fully commits to its own plot.Don't go watch it if you're going to judge it with your politically correct goggles on.This was a great film in 3D.",1
35,"Awful, just awful. Makes Clash of the Titans look good.If you want Egyptian entertainment, see The Mummy series instead, much better and more entertaining.The only good thing about this movie releasing is I don't have so see that trailer anymore. Silver lining.",0
36,"I only got through the first 50 minutes of agony of this movie. Before I wrote this I tried hard to think of any redeemable quality about this movie and couldn't think of a single thing. The writing sucks, the acting sucks, and the cgi sucks. This is another example of cgi just destroying a movie. YOu have to have a balance of real sets with cgi. I'm not kidding when I say I don't think there was a single real set made for this movie. Just stay away or reccommend this movie to someone you hate.",0
37,"This whole genre has been a cinematic failure and with this film the trend continues stronger than ever. From over the top special effects trying too hard to please audience, to poor character development and dialogue, there really wasn't much to write home about. In fact, I was really just wanting it to end,",0
38,"What. A. Terrible. Movie. Worst movie i have seen. DO NOT RECOMMEND TO WATCH. Cheesy, goofy acting, writing is god awful, I can't explain how awful the CGI is, welcome back to 2003. This is supposed to be good????????? And the director calling critics idiots? How worse can this get, just don't watch it. Please. For your money.",0
39,"130 million has burned this film.It looks visually good but that do a lot of movies. But if we take the story, screenplay, cast and the rest under the microscope shows the whole misery.A fürchtbar dreary and boring movie with weak actors and a bad director.Too bad about the money.",0
40,"""Gods of Egypt"" is a movie that the first part was interesting , but the second was very boring , very boring , I loved the special effects and music , but that does not may redeem , and the results is more worst than "" Knowing"" .",0
41,"Gods of Egypt has a story that's derivative of Aladdin and The Lion King, It has pacing problems, contradicting plot points, hokey acting, and scenarios that are flat out stupid, so why am I giving it an 8/10? Because Gods of Egypt is that special type of bad, the type of bad film that takes itself way too seriously that its so oblivious to its laughable issues that you can't help but enjoy yourself by laughing at all of its absurdities. While it's not in the same league as say ""The Room"" levels of bad. Its certainly the type of film that you will not get bored throughout. To give you an idea of how bad the film is, the very first dialogue scene between two characters is so heavily filled with exposition about the gods that you'd swear they're part of some brainwashing cult. However the real stars of the show here are the CGI heavy fight scenes, with visuals that look like they came out of a PS1 era cutscene video, and cinematography that tries WAAAAAY too hard to be ""Intense"" and ""Epic"" constant 360 sweeping shots, terrible animation, some weird use of color filters and resolutions that are so mind numbingly stupid, you have to wonder how the VFX team never spoke out at the director and said ""This is dumb"". Also Anubis's Toilet Flushing teleportation. Couldn't stop laughing at that one on the way back home. So all in all I would recommend seeing Gods of Egypt, but not for the same reasons the filmmakers intended. Go see it with friends for a good laugh and then hit the pub afterwards to make fun of how stupid it was.",1
43,"While Gods of Egypt has a somewhat dopey charm, the fun starts to end in the second half and the bore starts to set in.  The action scenes are laced with poor CGI and many effects made popular in the late 90's.  Can't say it's all bad, but I can't sit through it again.  D+",0
44,"Rented this movie from Redbox not expecting much but was actually surprised as to how good it was.  Some great performances with some surprising appearances from actors who I had no idea were in the movie.  It's nice to see the spotlight on the god of the Egyptian mythology for a change.  Though normally appearing as humans, the Gods can revert to their animal form when fighting which makes for some cool battle sequences and visuals.  The fearless mortal thief character was a nice addition to the adventure, grounding the story a little while providing some humor and fun.  A movie worth checking out.",1
45,"This is Wild Wild West all over again. You go see it expecting a story about the old Egypt, and suddenly, Saint Seiya armors all over the place. Powers are so unbalanced. I mean, we know this is fiction, but sometimes the human has abilities bigger than the gods, and also he is a clear copy of Aladdin. The love story is boring. I guess the movie will be OK for some audiences, like Wild Wild West was. If you are a geek, nerd or something close to that, DON'T SEE IT, you will get mad on every scene.",0
47,"In the span of two hours of dreadful script and forceful plot, any glint of opulence can't save ""Gods of Egypt"" from being mindlessly numb. ""Gods of Egypt"" asks an age old question, ""Does flashy sparkle outweighs written words?”. Unfortunately for the two hours movie, its visual is inconsistent and the story has so many illogical flaws, that whatever gorgeous scenery it has would feel bland. Furthermore, the acting is sloppy, having less-than-charismatic characters mumbling cringe-worthy monologue for half its time. This is the tedious story of Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), the supposed king of fictional Egypt where gods and mortals live side by side. He then finds opposition from his uncle Set (Gerard Butler). He then forms unusual alliance with Bek (Brenton Thwaites), a human thief with a single-minded drive for juvenile  love. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Gerard Butler are not bad, they have experience on this type of epic saga as Jaime Lannister and Leonidas, respectively. However, this also feels as though they are just going through the motion. Here they are shades, less appealing and more brooding version of their famous roles. Bek as the other main lead is your typical charming hoodlum without the charm. His characterization is too rigid and any attempt to romanticized or deliver witty humor is instead annoying. The two leading females are too over zealously created for flamboyant melodramatic romance. There are a couple decent supporting cast such as Rufus Sewell as Urshu and Chadwick Boseman as Thoth, but they merely have small portions of spotlight. The script feels forced to create any chemistry between the characters, however it often sounds like soap opera. Not to mention story line is plagued by awful plot devices. Being gods doesn't exemplify them from having sudden illogical and convenient twists, a few of these might be fine, but after half dozen times audience would appreciate more explanation than simple magic. Visual is arguably pretty. At its best the movie offers some aesthetically pleasing scenes and the costumes worn as well as the set are very easy on the eyes. Still, among these beautiful people and vistas, it's not often to see it smeared by strangely subpar CGI, as though these are Transformers made from low budget production. Tainted by shady narrative, corrupted visual and barren script, ""Gods of Egypt"" is mindlessly numb.",0
49,"Guess what!! We got an early topnotch contender for next year's Razzie Award! CGI was overused and the movie was filled with un-engaging plot. The only good thing about this movie are the costumes and the humor of that Black Egyptian God(yes it's not an all white Gods) and the snakes, they were incredible.",0
50,"You know it's gonna be suck when the Egyptian gods are all portrayed by white people.Hollywood still doesn't learn the mistakes from the past, do they ?",0
51,"Bad writing with in credible goofy acting and direction. Each dialog is very non substantial and every response most of the times are some kind of ""supposed to be funny dialog"" The worst of it all is the CGI. Very clunky and old considering the state we are in movie industries. It looks like this movie it has been in the locker room for a while and they have decide to rush it and trow it out there. Bottom line, do not see this at any cost!",0
52,"Wow this film is amazing!  This is a solid 10 for pure fun and entertainment!  Thank you to the film makers and crew I love this film, it is beautiful in every way, the visuals, music, set/costume designs, scipt, acting and brilliant cast!  Truly an outstanding film for its pure entertainment value. I own the 3D bluray edition of Gods of Egypt and it is a must own disc set.",1
53,"Gods of Egypt (as predicted) was a total disaster. While it isn't the movie ever made, because lets be honest here, we all have seen much worse. The effect's looked unfinished, Gerard Butler was way too over the top and Alex Proyas is slowing becoming a hack.",0
54,"My first impression of walking out of the theater after seeing Gods of Egypt was that I couldn't remember anything about the movie except for Gerard Butler's amazing death scream at the end. I like fun action movies as much as the next guy, but this movie was just too boring and too full of schlock CGI to be worth my time.",0
55,"How could you hate Gods of Egypt? Gods of Egypt is the best movie I've ever seen that takes place on Egypt and you can't do anything about it because I love Gods of Egypt a lot! *insert sarcasm here* Nah, I was just kidding. Gods of Egypt is nowhere to be found at all.",0
56,"An embarrassment to films from the special effects, to the acting and everything in between...........................................................",0
57,"This is set in a time when giant gods walked among the ""little people"" and ruled the country. When there's a clash between 2 of them (Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), a mortal (Brenton Thwaites) joins the battle to save the world...and his girlfriend. It plays out more preposterous than it sounds. There are numerous chases and fights (none are exciting or innovative), weird creatures (which inspire no awe) and fantastical locations (badly rendered CGI). To add to the absurdity: almost every character, except various slaves and other lowly types, are blandly pale with British accents (speaking ridiculous dialogue). At least it's paced well enough, but that doesn't overcome the fact that it's cheesy, cliché-ridden and epically awful.",0
59,"There are many things wrongs with this film so I'll pick a few to cover: I don't like how the actors playing Gods were CG'd larger than humans, It felt very out of place and seemed very much like a waste of time and money. I thought there was way too much reliance on CG in general and it's so poorly done that it everything, especially the awful fight scenes, stick out like a sore thumb. Like it's way too obvious that it's fake in comparison to let's say a Marvel film where it is still kind of grounded in reality.I also felt the movie was very poorly edited. It just jumped from area to area with little to no explanation as to how the characters got there. It felt as if I had just skipped the 5 minutes prior to explaining how/why they got to where they are. IDK if it was just sloppy writing or not but it became even more obvious as the film went on.Now the film isn't a total wash as Coster-Waldau and Butler are fine leads and in any other circumstances, It would have been great to see both pitted against each other. Sadly, Gods of Egypt tired too hard to be this big CG blockbuster when it should have tried to tone things down a bit.",0
60,This is family/fairy tale/adventure movie. I have enjoyed it a lot. Besides I was positively suprised that this movie digs deep into Egyptian mythology and is mostly very accurate to this. I give 10/10 not to rise up average score but becuase I really like that movie so much. For me it was fresh and fun.,1
61,"I don't really keep track of movie studios but Lionsgate movies almost always suck. Except for Expendables 2, great movie. The only parts I liked were the god of knowledge and Anubis for corny value.",0
62,"Gods of Egypt, wow, just wow, this was awful on every conceivable level, it gets nothing right.  The film cost 140 million dollars and it clearly isn’t showing the effects, which are crap and I am certain for that reason alone it was made with bad money.  It was an awful inconsistent plot with a horrible script.  The actors give horrid performances and are terribly mis cast and there are a ton of white actors playing Egyptians, aside from that everyone puts on a terrible British accent.  The effects are inconsistent from scene to scene, the action is terrible.  I hated this film.  This is a damming indictment of where Blockbusters are going and the fact that the director of this film, who also directed I Robot, had the nerve to have a go at critics, calling them vultures, for daring to negatively review this film is rich because frankly this film deserves every negative backlash it can get. It is an awful piece of work and Mark Kermode said it best, you have to remember, vultures don’t eat living breathing things, they eat dead rotten things, so yes, for that reason alone, I would be glad to join the vultures on that one.  It’s just awful, this is a bomb in every sense of the word",0
63,"A comic book for 6 year olds ... Whoops! Sorry. Even my 6 year olds are smart enough to pass on this one. Too bad Gerald Butler did not. Hopefully everyone involved in this film cashed their checks quickly and removed the film credit from their resumes.Nothing in this film has anything to do with gods or Egypt. A rambling incoherent jumble of CGI and story that flashes 3D special effects at you with rapid speed. 'Gods of Egypt' will remind you of an extended video game trailer rather than a film.",0
64,"What's your favorite mythology movie of all time? Now imagine that, but add an incoherent story and water it down with an orgy of over the top, unrealistic CGI. Now you have Gods of Egypt.",0
65,"God-Awful.Everything about Gods of Egypt failed.  Now, i'm gonna ignore the fact that most of the cast were white people, instead focusing on what the movie is.  The movie is garbage. The CGI, the story, the acting, the writing, the characters.   EVERYTHING about this movie was done past the point of terrible.  Granted, it's not the worst movie i've ever seen, but good lord, is it one of the worst.  The only redeemable quality about this movie I could find was that the visuals were pretty, but you can keep polishing a turd until it shines, but then all you have is a shiny turd.  Overall, this movie should not exist; if you're reading this and you're thinking about going and seeing it, wait until it comes out on Netflix or Hulu if you want to watch it.  Don't waste your money on something as abysmal as this. Gods of Egypt gets a 1/10.",0
66,"So all you people out there who love a good bad movie. Wouldn't it be great to have a terribly brilliant movie full of over the top CGI, laughable dialogue starring Jaime Lannister and Gerard Butler? Well don't hold your breath cause this sure ain't it. Instead you'll have to endure over two hours of some of the worst acting imaginable, a story that makes zero sense, CGI that wouldn't be seen dead in a video game and sibling rivalry, how's that for lazy writing. Honestly no one in the making of this movie even bothered to try, just showed up for the pay cheque. I didn't expect greatness by any means but there are no words for this utter mess. Not recommended.",0
67,"I actually was expecting more out of this movie, I've heard Nicolaj was a good actor in his show GoT, but most of the performances are pretty lazy and sloppy. Almost all the shot, it was so obvious there was a green screen there. Sometimes I laughed but for the wrong reason, the one a director doesn't want a viewer to laugh.",0

71,"Gods of Egypt: Flat, Cgi, great actors, and a story (somewhere deep hidden in the movie). When i saw the title i thought: ""Hey, another Clash of the Titans movie or a kind of sequel"". When i took a look at the cast, which was pretty flushed in comparison to the Clash of the Titans cast, i noticed it was, once again, another Egypt ""God Movie"". The movie started pretty fast with the introduction of the story and main characters but after about 10 minutes i still was like the plot has to be introduced. The characters were too briefly introduced which led to a lot of  ""Oh that one in the beginning"". and the plot was in my opinion severely lacking in depth. I did not expect the characters to contain the emotional depth as a Spielberg movie, although when certain events happened in the movie, i found them very poorly integrated into the development of the character and certainly a lack of emotional state of mind. I had a feeling the whole movie was one of another ""I want my revenge"" movie with a lot of to narrowly made up characters and a story which was rather thin and boring. Watch if:-You like Egyptian style movies with a lot of Egyptian mythology-You want to see Gerald butler a rather different role-Jamie Lanister Don't watch if:-You seek for a well crafted story line with in-depth character development-You are an archaeologist and you want the movie to contain a correct depiction of the Egyptian mythology",0
72,"So, you have a budget of 142 million dollars, fail miserably resulting in a film embarrassing that that even chimpanzees  would give a ""facepalm"" on how much embarrassing it is, barely make a profit of $ 2 million, and yet, you as a producer, you have the nerve to tell critics they are idiots! Overview: the film has some impressive landscapes, but that's all. As for the rest, it's a terrible and boring succession of scenes  , chases and fights embarrassing and not exciting. Not much .... but you know where you're starting to feel sorry that the film had potential due mythological theme which does have a variety of mythical places: cosmic inferno, desert, oases, etc.Most actors who play the roles of gods are white and black (none of them Egyptian there  who appear   have a physiognomy of the Near East). Gods men dressed in suits and gold armor that kitsch ala the Immortals. And guess what, the gods have faces of animals but can spill: Horus into a humanoid bird to say that's a manga cartoon unicorns, and Seth in a Terminator-looking dog. That Pharaoh Osiris is not that we know of hieroglyphics, green and always mummified, but simply Actor and old to be there to be killed by jealous brother, Seth. And Isis ... is a daddy to be there.Somehow, just trying to look like Anubis and Thoth book, omniscient god who has a narcissistic clone army that helps. Ra's about the only one who shone literally (a bald old uncle that only grows in height and lights). I loved representation of the mythical naive: Boat solar million years is like a spacecraft from Stargate  with  sun  in  a chain in a river cosmic endlessly above the Earth is flat (the other part being the afterlife) .... and as Ra, night after night, like a surly old farts periodically strike the guy with the newspaper in flies that bother him of sleep, battled with the snake (better said worm) celestial dust that represents chaos and darkness. Night after night, that makes him, to bring the sun in the sky.That was about the only good moment of the film that rest was wailing.Judgement of the dead is made in the following way: every soul of a deceased man had to bring wealth. As the richer you were, the more was better and received an eternal afterlife.Story: it's far below Mummy!Horus begins with a drunk with fame and arrogant, sexy goddess Hathor engaged, that is ready to be crowned as the new Pharaoh ... or rather, co-pharaoh as Osiris still held good. Just as occurs coup waged by Seth-Gerard Butler equipped armor spartan (as it should be in 300) who brings his army of strange, he cut Osiris and we blindly Horus, taking his eyes as pearls and exiles it. And here starts the whole story focusing on mortal abilities with jefuitior higher James Bond or Catwoman, and best climber and athlete something like Prince of Persia or as Mario when surpasses obstacles, passing traps, decipher riddles. Not to mention as in the whole movie is funny and smiling like a sheaf of wheat. In order to return to  his  babe to life, resorting to collaborate with Horus and his eyes looking for and help it to regain strength.Thus begins one of the most boring succession of scenes lately sequences copied from other films like Mummy and the Clash of the Titans: instead of giant scorpions, giant snakesSeth ,  with Eye of Horus, the heart of Osiris and brain Thoth, builds armor terminator high a huge obelisk to impress his father, Ra, steals then sword / wand to lure Apphopis to destroy the world, to unleash chaos, and he will bring a new order.Bek and Horus and has to climb up to heaven to take water from cosmic evil to put a few drops into the pit towards the center of the earth that can destroy and neutralize his powers Seth desert.Obviously they fail and place all sorts of clichés no longer understand anything in the movie.Then you ask yourself what kind of monkey could write such a scenario then to afford to make you ""idiot"". And so we finally Fighting bling bling with a happy-end with the resurrection and the god Horus reaching a populist would make even kindergarten children to and spank leading embarrassing how much is in the film.Finally, I stop that already makes me sick when I remember. Actors: Gerard Butler besides trying to make him somewhat on  rough, but not out, and the appearance of Geoffrey Rush, all are pathetic.NOTE: 3 Avoid it as much as possible because it's more dust than Clash of the Titans. Honestly, Mummy   the better than to see this mythological atrocity.",0
73,"The reason I am rating this movie so high is due to the lingering excitement and expectations of this year's beginning, and am thoroughly shocked. When i saw the stunning imagery and Butler , I wanted to give this movie a go. Turns out that I could not even finish it. The white gods did not bother me so despite my affinity with Egyptian Mythology, but just about everything else did. The bad CGI, uneventful and dull fight scenes, and the actors' failure to bring their characters to life. I could see limitless potential with this movie. I guess the director couldn't.  This 140 million dollar movie turned out to be a middle school performing arts extra credit assignment. If you choose to watch it, have money you are prepared to lose.",0
74,WTF is this **** Who is this movie made for? its so awful and bad it actually funny in a very sad sad way. Did nobody in the production crew watch this crap and thought **** our movie suck balls should we cancel it. btw i didn't know the gods in egypt were all white people ... fail don't waste you're time on this garbage unless you want to watch with a bunch of friends and laugh how crappy the cgi.,0
75,"Gods of Egypt is not a regular Hollywood production that lacks in honesty, decency or fun; it surpassed many bad examples of this kind in every aspect of failure. If this film is going to have a sequel, which is possible, and really frightening; it better be a two-hour-long apology to movie goers.",0
76,"Despite some hilariously out of place one-liners, the story is just too infuriatingly bonkers & the dodgy CGI looks several millennia out of date. The worst part of it all is the ending - which hints eagerly at a sequel.",0
78,"What's there not to like here? There's Gerard Butler. There's lots of action. There's some so-so acting (hey Keanu's acting was so-so on Speed, and everyone still loved the movie, so yes, some movies can survive so-so acting). There's lots of variety: a little Indiana Jones, a little The Mummy, a WHOLE LOT OF CGI madness. There's quite a lot of style - Geoffrey Rush's ship and his clothes are a work of art!It's one of those movies to watch when you've had a very tired day and just want to watch some crazy action without being too worried about the storyline. It's all in all surprisingly fun. Whenever I see professional critics pan a movie, I tend to want to see it for myself, and often, I find myself disagreeing with the pro critics. Watch it if you're looking for a fun movie.",1
79,"Alex Proyas' Gods of Egypt is a truly incredible creation that can only be properly described as: what? Telling the story of the gods of Egypt and a struggle for the role of King of all Egypt, this film is truly a sight to behold. Really, the amount that goes on in these two hours is hard to put to words. That said, I am going to try. In the film, Set (Gerard Butler) is the god of Darkness, while his brother, Osiris (Bryan Brown), is King. As Osiris is set to pass the role of King to his son, Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), Set is unhappy. Thus, he kills Osiris, blinds Horus, and takes the crown. Set then proceeds to kill all gods against him and enslave the population of Egypt, while also attacking his father, Ra (Geoffrey Rush). By attacking Ra, he allows a demon that Ra fights nightly to attack the world with the intention of having this demon consume the afterlife. This would then give Set immortality and the power that would come with this. Meanwhile, Horus is distraught and blind, hiding in seclusion. That is until he meets Bek (Brenton Thwaites). A thief, Bek was enslaved by Set, along with his love Zaya (Courtney Eaton). When he tries to help Zaya escape, she is killed by Set's builder. In an attempt to rescue her from the afterlife, Bek strikes a deal with Horus to help him steal back his eyes (Bek had already stolen one back) in return for granting life back to Zaya. However, unbeknownst to Bek, Horus does not have the power to give life. Only Ra has that ability. Even worse, Set has made it so that to enter the afterlife, one must have riches. Zaya has none, meaning that she will be destroyed. Fortunately, Horus' love and the goddess of love, Hathor (Elodie Yung), is in a position to help. After recognizing the love Bek has for Zaya, she sacrifices herself by taking off a bracelet. This bracelet, given to her by Horus, had protected her from the demons that wished to consume her soul. By giving it to Bek to give to Zaya, Hathor feels as though she fulfilled her purpose as a god. Funnily enough, Zaya never needed it because that demon Set unleashed on the afterlife began consuming the afterlife right when it was her turn to relinquish her riches. Now, however, Bek and Horus must fight back against the world. Here, Horus learns that his journey was to fight for humanity and serve the world, rather than himself and other gods. In defeating Set, he teams up with Bek to save Egypt and restore order to the world. They also steal back Ra's sword - which Set had taken - to give Ra back his power. Once his sword is back in his hand, Ra is able to kill the demon. Moved by Horus' actions, Ra offers his services to his grandson. To repay Bek - who was killed by Set at this point - Horus asks Ra to give Bek and Zaya back their life so that they may be together once more. Ra grants this and Horus is made the King of Egypt while Bek and Zaya get to live happily ever after. Phew.As you can tell, this plot is convoluted. It makes literally no sense. Yet, what bothers me most is that this is done joylessly. For a film this stupid with this many moving parts, Gods of Egypt is a long two hour film. It takes forever to get through and is the definition of a slog. It takes itself far too seriously for a film as stupid as it is. This film features two gods fighting as birds or something and yet, it still has a sense of self-importance that is hard to ignore. Had it enjoyed itself and poked fun at the lunacy on screen, Gods of Egypt could have been the best b-movie in years. Yet, instead, it is merely a serious film with seriously horrific acting and even worse special effects.Having previously made good films, Alex Proyas is far too talented to produce this mess of a film and think that it is an acceptable work. It is a film with the quality of a mockbuster by The Asylum. The fact that Lionsgate thought this was a good idea with franchise potential does not shock me though, considering that Lionsgate is one of the the stupidest, ill-conceived distributors releasing films in the 21st century.",0
80,"Visually ZERO. Story ZERO. Acting ZERO. You could drop a sudden ""sharknado"" in the middle of this mess and you would not bat an eye---it would count as story development.",0
81,not Terible but not good either simple your Average Greek mythology film with lots of action and a bit of humour   just another film that wants to get the action right so bad it forgets to have a good enough story or acting,0
83,Ham and Cheese fest with lousy CGI. The acting is so hammy and much of the dialogue so stupid that it's almost like comedy.  Maybe it would have been a game breaker on getting the film made.  But they should have made this an R film and given it a harder edge.  Then perhaps it would not have been so incredibly silly.,0
84,I avoided this movie for a long time because of the reviews. After watching it I really don't understand where all the hate is coming from. It's a lot of fun. I'll definitely be watching it again.,1
86,"Boring. Terrible CGI, spinning camera during fight scenes which will make you dizzy and terrible jokes. Save yourself the pain and don't see it like I regretfully did.",0
87,"One word, intolerable. The CG which kinda looked overdone and stupid. At one point Gerard butler is in the sky like Santa clause on a sledge being whisked around by a giant beatle, looked so stupid. Poor directing and writing. Just useless movie",0
89,"I enjoyed this film. Luxuriously rich in beautiful graphics, but also, unafraid to give a God portrayal of Ancient Egypt. This is the purpose of movies, to enjoy, entertain, and leave the mind pondering, and wanting more. Perhaps a sequel could be set in the modern era, unleashing the Gods",1
90,"This is a fantasy movie on ""Planet Egypt"". It is a super hero movie, set to the background of Egyptian mythology that never was. It is fantastic in it's spectacle, imagery and breadth. The performances are decent and in many cases excellent (Elodie Yung, Gerard Butler) and the story is fascinating.",1
92,"What a mess of a movie. It's just a bunch of glowing CGI nonsense slopped all over the screen while actors, both with and without talent, wander around. This is not a movie I would pay to see but even catching it for free on television doesn't mitigate how much of a waste of space it is.Despite the garishness of it all, there were a couple character beats that held some potential, but sadly that went mostly unrealized. It just wasn't a good movie. Even as  mindless action, it didn't really work, because the preponderance of bad CGI just made everything feel too cartoonish.",0
93,"I haven't seen other reviews of this movie and I'm obviously late to the party on writing a review, but having just watched it on HBO I have to say I enjoyed the movie.The story was fun and made sense.  It was well cast for the bigger roles.  The weakest acting in the movie came from the actor who played Beck in the movie, but he didn't do a poor enough job to ruin it.  I found the pacing to be good and no scene dragged on excessively.I will acknowledge that the gods transforming into robots was a bit odd and the fact that Sett could upgrade himself with parts from other gods was different.  Having said that its all based on mythology and since its all fiction I accepted what they did and the liberties they took.My only problem with the movie is the final fight.  It was short and didn't live up to the epic scale of the movie.  Despite that I enjoyed the movie.  It reminded me of movies from the 80s and 90s which for me is nostalgia.Its not a bad movie as many say.",1
94,"Gods Of EgyptOUA qu’elle claque !!! Des effets nombreux, bien réalisés et malgré ce qu'on pourrait penser des effets réalistes vis-à-vis du point de vue scénario; qui est maintenu tout le film. Quelle claque de voir un film qui tient tant à mettre la mythologie égyptienne au cœur de son discours et en respecté les codes ou histoire (dépend de ce que vous été).Une histoire d'amour en façade, mais une profondeur bienvenue, mettant en scène les deux façade de l’Égypte[spoiler]    (Mort-Vivant)    [/spoiler]    , des dieux [spoiler]    de métal pour en faire des machines de guerre    [/spoiler]    , mais entre nous tellement bien de voire les poings fusé et la puissance des coups brisés du bâtiment.De bon acteur, et retrouvé un Lanister est un plaisir émoticône smileUn bon film qui a le mérite de faire passé certain message qui déplairont, mais m'on plus. Je simplifierais par un film rebelle assumé ! Un film qui en vaut la chandelle émoticône wink",1

For those whinners who claim more non-white people in Egypt, just take a little excerse and watch the egyptian pictograms and they'll found all anthropomorphic gods were white and with caucasian traits. Politics in movies won't change history, sorry.",1
101,"It is an absolute sin that this movie has of high as a user rating as a 4.5. Let that sink in a moment. Avoid this movie forever!!! Terrible, terrible garbage!",0
102,"Great things about the movie:1. The production design during coronation scene is beautiful.2. Costumes of the gods and properties (golden stuff) are amazing.Weaknesses of the movie:1. The visual effects are very bad.2. The casting and acting are not as expected.3. The music is not good enough, some are not even suitable for the scenes.4. The story is not appealing.5. Many aspects are too easy and too simplified, like how the heroes can survive or defeat the enemies.Debatable holes:1. During the coronation, why did Osiris not have his own army, bodyguards or fighters? Or at least gods who were with him had their own?2. If Set was known as god of trickery, envy, and violence, then they should have figured out that he would do such nasty thing.3. When Set was messing with the coronation, the other gods should have done something.4. How could Zaya find the secret plan so easily? If it was so secret, how was it not kept well? In fact, because it safeguarded the eye of Horus, then it could not be easily put like that.5. When Horus and Bek flew to Ra, Bek should have not been able to breathe.6. Instead of hitting Horus with a rock on the waterfall, Mnevis should have killed him.7. Thoth did not look very wise, in his actions, thoughts, words, and portrayal.8. The Sphinx should have killed Horus and friends because they had given 2 wrong answers.9. How could Horus and Hathor free themselves from the cage and get out of the pyramid so easily?10. When Horus, Hathor, and Bek got out of the pyramid, they should have met Set. They were only seconds apart. Where did Set go to anyway, and how did he get out of the collapsing pyramid?11. Set's pyramid was easily figured out by Bek.12. Although Set had some gods' powers, he could not defeat a one-eyed Horus and a mortal.13. Bek easily deflected Set's spear and took the eye of Horus, considering that he was just a regular mortal and facing a god with multiple powers and an armor.",0
