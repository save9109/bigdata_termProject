0,"I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros:1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in the dreamworld.2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns.3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next but still you feel jumpy about it.4. its fast storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even at the second viewing.5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe.6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons:1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film, if you ask me.2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more than enough characters than necessary. They may play some roles in the plot but they seemed more of distraction than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused.3. a bit preachy - I noticed the characters would explain things about the dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick.In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement.I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks.Cheers!",1
1,"Inception is a daring original, and mind-provoking film. One of 2010's best.",1
2," What makes Inception so special is that it's not your typical straight forward summer blockbuster. Nolan gives you bits and pieces of information, and as the movie plays out the viewer begins to put the pieces together and the picture gradually becomes clearer. Chris Nolan doesn't dumb down the movie for the audience like most Hollywood movies do these days, he expects us to keep up with him. And when we do, the reward is extremely gratifying. And the visuals were amazing.",1
4, Funny how people think complex equals smart and intellectual. This movie was a big bag of hot wind. Matrix was better.,0
6,I thought this movie was not as good as people are saying.  Because we knew it was dreams inside dreams the over the top fight scenes had no bearing.  Who cared?  As a result the movie became boring and repetitious.  I would be very hard pressed to recommend this movie to anyone.  Stay away.,0
7,"Christopher Nolan directs what must be his magnum opus with the complex Inception, a beautifully realized, tightly plotted  surreal experience bolstered by a magnetic score by Hans Zimmer, great acting by the cast and thrilling set pieces.",1
8,"Inception is a spider's web woven with such intricacy that only when focused, you can find a way out. With brilliant material for the brilliant cast to work on, Inception delivers a complex masterpiece at an intellectual as well as visceral level. Top-notch directing, acting, cinematography, editing and Hans Zimmer's brilliant soundtrack only cements this as a modern classic.",1
9,An amazing film.  If you love puzzles and are not offendend at that fact that you may not understand everything that you see (the first viewing); then this film is for you.,1
10,"BRILLIANT.... simply BRILLIANT!Very hard to understand at first  (much like MATRX), however, it all came together by the end.Acting, special effects, story-line, direction, and creative ideas SUPERB!",1
11,"Really great movie. It was impeccably structured, visually fantastic, and generally perfectly executed. It was creative, ambitious, and intelligent, which are qualities that make it stand out from typical hollywood fare on their own.  People call it a mindf**k, but don't confuse that for trippiness or a convoluted JJ Abrams mess, it made a great deal of sense. It is certainly a movie that wants you to think about after watching it. I think some people are trying to view this movie as an action movie, or an exploration of psychology and dreams, but it's neither of those. Those are all great things, but this is a heist movie. This is the kind of movie that Ocean's 11 would be if Ocean's 11 was far more original, intelligent, and had a greater respect for its audience.",1
12,"Absolutely amazing film. Amazing soundtrack, special effects and writing. Would watch it again at least a 100 times. Should have won more awards in my opinion.",1
13,"I seriously don't understand how people are giving this move anything lower than seven, strong dialog, innovative action scenes, and the deep characters all make this an B+, A- movie. But what really distinguishes this movie as one of my favorites is the conflict with Cobb's lost love and the final kick sequence (this being one of the best scenes in the history of film making) forces my hand on to give it a 10.",1
14,"This is one movie that will make your head hurt, in a good way, this is Nolan's best film yet, and this is the guy who directed The Dark Knight, the complexity of the movie is what makes it so good, the ending is quite a cliffhanger too. And the visual effects are amazing. This is my favorite movie. Period.",1
15,"Inception is amazing simple as that it's amazing how Christopher Nolan can have so many Masterpieces pretty much everything the guy does it brilliant. Everything about the movie was great it has an all star cast, amazing visuals and top notch story telling that was easy to understand even back when I first watched the film. I will say that I have seen better of Leonardo DiCaprio even though he still did a great job in this movie. I love Joseph Gordon-Levitt so this is just another reason to love him. Also this is the movie that made me start to like Ellen Page she always seemed annoying to me but not after this. Oh yeah and it's another great score from Hans Zimmer. Overall i give it a 10",1
16,"First time I watched it in cinema, I was a little bit baffled or misoriented. However after getting the DVD I watch it once a week I think. I just can`t get over this flick! Where do I start - maybe from the best. First off, performance worth of an Oscar by Leonardo DiCaprio, excellent acting by Marion Cotillard and Ken Watanabe, above average by all the rest, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. All of the characters without exceptions are engaging in their own way",1
17,"A beautifully complex movie by modern master filmmaker Christopher Nolan.  The performances, editing, music and visual effects are remarkable and surely Oscar worthy.  Intelligent, mesmerising and astounding, this a must-see movie experience.",1
18,Don't think of elephants..... What do you think of?The concept of using your sub conscious as a form of weaponry is a fascinating concept that has been adapted to a fantastic film by Christopher Nolan. The effects were nothing short of brilliant and the concept that drives the storyline was perfect. The actors played a huge part in ensuring the success of the film and I felt that Ellen Page andLeonardo Dicaprio were fantastic in getting their role. Overall the concept of the movie leaves us with unanswered questions. In particular the ending of the movie questions the reality of life. In fact what do we define as real or unreal? What is reality? Are we controlled by a dream? Why do we have dreams? The movie captured my attention and was a great work. Overall a fantastic movie that was brilliantly staged by Nolan. 9/10,1
19,"An incredible achievement by Nolan, an absolute masterpiece. The film gets more complicated as it ticks down and while it has a satisfying ending, there is still question regarding what really happened.",1
20,"I found that it didn't really amaze me with its plot or character development quite as much as Nolan's other films such as The Dark Knight, but it's a fast-paced and thought provoking action movie that is sure to keep you thinking long after the end credits roll. Plus, the concept is just plain cool.",1
21,"Good movie. I found the ending to be a bit clichÃ©, and was easily predictable at least half an hour into the film. I really was hoping for it not to end that way, and felt a bit cheated. Also, as much as it tries to be a movie that make you think about it long after it's over, it doesn't.That said, It does an amazing job exploring and fleshing out the subject matter. In that regard, it is truly unique and very much worth seeing.If you liked this film, I would also highly recommend seeing Paprika.",1
22,"With Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, making Inception is another big step towards the Oscars. Although Nolan did not get nominated in 2008 for The Dark Knight, directing Inception will definitely give him a boost in the category. A story taken in a place where we can go into people's dreams and control them completely. Just like Nolan's previous work, Memento, Inception's script is complex yet very entertaining and easy for the audience to understand. Intellectually, Inception is a very high-class film, but the film also demonstrates its dramatic side in which Leonardo DiCaprio comes in. The cast delivered with a sense that they knew exactly what was going on and Joseph Gordon-Levitt added the fun element to the film. Inception is mind-blowing, visceral, and smart, at the same time delivering the biggest Hollywood blockbuster of the year. OscarBuzz: Best Picture (like Avatar last year), Best Screenplay, Best Director (maybe), Best Support Actor - Levitt (good chance), Best Actor - DiCaprio (maybe), Technical awards (total domination)!!!",1
23,"This movie is really one candidate for the best film ever. I recommended everyone to watch this movie, ideally more then once. Its has a complex and deep plot mixed with various mainstream elements. A Blockbuster.",1
26," A mind-bending roller coaster of a movie. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Cast was inspired, ensemble acting.",1
27," Fantastic movie. No, it isn't a truly original concept, but nothing is. I don't see how anyone could think this was boring, as there was action throughout most of the movie and the stakes were higher than death. So glad Hollywood made a movie that's not a sequel. You have to be paying attention and thinking about what's going on at all levels of the dreams to really understand what's going on, which might put off some people, but it really enhances the film. I love non-linear storytelling, though, so I might be biased. Great acting as well. Glad to see Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (aka chick from Juno and dude from (500) Days of Summer/Third Rock from the Sun) do some action roles to show they have chops outside pseudo-indie hipster movies. Worth seeing again.",1
29,Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.Amazing.,1
30,"One of the better movies made in while. A very intruiging concept that really gets you thinking. It isnt perfect but its pretty close. Its one of those movies you have to really pay close attention to and there is plenty of action, special effects are nicely done. Overall very good. 9/10.",1
31,"I loved this movie. I thought it was one of the best of the year. The visuals were incredible, and the story was creative sci-fi adventure. I really can't see how people said this was boring or the plot lost itself. I was in a packed theater and you could hear the response vocally; they seemed to love it. I think it is just backlash because it made so much money and was all over the media at the time; people come in with a glass of haterade. If it wasn't for you cool, but don't give it a zero just to hate on something.",1
32,"Easiest 10 I've ever given. Unique story that really wrinkles the brain. Leo was great, Ellen Page was great. Saw it a second time to answer some questions I had but ended up leaving the theatre with a few more. In my opinion that's a great movie. Christopher Nolan does it again.",1
33,"watched it twice and loved the mental challenge induced, the great visuals, the performances! one of the best films of any genre for 2010! hope we see some Oscar noms for it soon!I loved the way Marion Cotillard gave so much depth to her haunting Mal and the understated yet key performance of Michael Caine's Miles.One of the best film opening scenes I have seen at least for this year if not longer. And an imposing yet 'enveloping' music score.",1
34,"The best piece of advice I can give you is to stop reading this review and go see Inception immediately, because the less you know going into it, the more rewarding your movie going experience will be, however, if blind faith is not your cup of tea (and since you're reading this, it probably isn't), read on, as I share a few words about one of the greatest summer blockbusters in recent years.The easiest way to describe Inception is to say that it deals with dreams, and people who enter other's dreams to find, or implant, information. As we soon learn, gaining information from dreams is difficult enough, but to implant information (a process called, you guessed it, inception), is a different story entirely. If you must know the plot, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe) to perform inception on Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy) in an effort to convince him to divide his father's (Maurice Fischer [Pete Postlethwaite]) company (this, as Alfred **** would say, is the MacGuffin). After consulting his old teacher, Miles (Michael Caine), Cobb picks up Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), to assist him and Arthur on their mission of inception. There is also a side story involving Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), and their two children. My plot synopsis ends here, as saying more would detract from the amazing moments you'll witness on-screen.Those who have seen director Christopher Nolan's 2000 effort, Memento, will not be surprised by Inception's requirement of the viewer to take each scene as it comes. Viewers and critics have called the film confusing. It's not confusing, it's complex. The film itself is explained in detail, and without the usual boring dialog that screams ""Did everybody get that?"". There's even well-timed comedic moments that serve to break the tension. The difficult complexities of the film come from what is not seen, the bigger picture, happening outside the parameters of the movie. This is why Inception has been the subject of debate on forums, blogs, and even around dinner tables. It's as though Nolan puts the viewer in the middle of his maze, gives them the map, then turns them loose; but, there's a catch, the edges of the map are burned and faded.The technical side of the film is near perfect. I can't recall another film where the special effects and cinematography were better matched to create a visual buffet that simultaneously feeds our hungry eyes and mind. Nolan's long-time cinematographer, Wally Pfister, has done a great work here that tells the story as well as the actors and their dialog. All the while, Hans Zimmer's score flows throughout the film, taking us where we need to go. While Nolan and his crew juggle the technical side of the film, Leonardo DiCaprio, and his cohorts, are in full-form as we journey alongside them through dreams inside of dreams.Inception is that rare treat that comes down the line when a studio (in this case Warner Bros.)  is smart, and brave, enough, to take a chance on something great and original. If you see one film in the theater this summer, make it Inception.",1
35,"When I first watched the film, I didn't see why it deserved so much praise. I saw that the acting was awesome, the plot, cinematography and score was great but something just didn't click. However, I decided to watch it again and find out a little bit more about the film. That is when I found out it was perfection and unique. No one really knows what the ending is supposed to mean and whether he's still in a dream and what is and isn't a dream. That's the beauty of it. You decide. There are so many different concept and every time you watch the film you can think of a new one. No film has ever left such a lasting impression on me. Many people love it but many people hate it because it is too complex for them or they didn't understand a concept. It is interesting and I was talking about it for weeks. Masterpiece.",1
36,Fantastic movie.  DiCaprio goes from strength to strength.  A wonderful blend of sci-fi and mind-bending physic with a simple driving core message.  Love.  Blended perfectly.  Well worth the effort to understand.,1
37,"i loved this movie!!! the graphics were trippy, all throughout the movie i was on edge then BAM! a cafe is obliterated and they all wake up back in reality. I love how at times its vague story line keeps you thinking with their fast faced action. christopher nolan obviously had a hell of a lot of time on his hands as his imagination ran wild!",1
38,A Great Achievement - The Effects are brilliant and there are strong performances especially from Marion Cotillard - The Dark Knight is better but it has competition with this film.,1
39,Whoever thinks this movie is boring is because they are stupid. YOU HAVE TO THINK FOR ONCE IN A MOVIE! The hallway scenes with Joe are the best scenes i've seen in a while. I thought everything was perfect and Christopher Nolan is the Alfred Hitchcock of this generation.,1
40,What I loved about this film is not just the original concept but the thrill factor. It was easy to understand the concept within 5 minutes into the film but the thrill had me going until the final moments. This was another brilliant film from the genius of Christopher Nolan. Great performances by all the actors as I thought it was a pretty decent cast.,1
41,"for me, the best movie this year so far.....10 out of 10...i really loved the plot..it was kinda confusing but it was well done..a well written script and a great director...A+",1
42,"Yeah, Incepiton is complex.  Is that a bad thing?  No.  If you look past the craziness the first time through, and the fact that Ellen Paige's character is only there to be an ""exposition shovel"", the movie has a lot of treats for people who go to see it more than once.  Also, there's a twist ending.  Watch it.",1
43," It seems that those who rate this movie low are the ones who cannot comprehend what its all about, nor can they interpret anything from the movie, be it from the pro critics, or just customers like me. I just saw this movie tonight with my friends and throughout the movie I just couldnt help but be bewildered at times at the complexity of the movie at times. The ending was one of the best and open endings Ive seen in a movie and can be interpreted so many ways. The movie is just fantastic, and has left my mind blown like many others. It is a must see this summer.",1
44, INCEPTION: Nolan has re-ivented the art of film making. The BEST film I have seen in 15 YEARS!!!,1
45," Movies can be educational, moving, or simply an escape. This is the latter, and time flies as you watch it - not unlike in a good dream. Forget the actors, ignore the script, and divorce reality. Immerse yourself in it and enjoy what a good movie can do...",1
46,"Inception doesn't need to be told by every review that it's new and fresh or (the opposite) stupid and ""puzzles me as to why people like this crap."" I understand that. It needs to be told it's a classic.",1
47,"Inception is a movie from a genre that has appeared in this century and since that date is becoming more strong a popular. I am talking about films that mess with our minds, that make you think and make you doubt between what it is really and what is not. These movies are like a subconscious tornado or a complete paradox. Some of those pictures are Inception, Memento, Black Swan, Alice in Wonderland and Rabbit Hole.Inception treats a dark and interesting topic, the dreams and the power of the subconscious; and because of that the plot is so tangled, complex and even timeless. The barrier between reality and fiction is broken; so who can tell which thing is which? Or what is the difference between those? Even if you discover the true reality, can you be sure? There is only one or there are more realities? No one can tell for sure. This film also has some enjoyable concepts: Carpe Diem, the Leap of Faith, the bad remember dream and the unconditional love. The quotes that represent these concepts the most are: -An old man fill with regret waiting to die alone- and -You are waiting for a train...Besides the amazing topic, the screenplay, direction and performances are very good. But the most outstanding thing of Inception is the visual effects: the explosions in the cafe, the bend of the city, the free fall of the van, the fight in the hotel and all the things that happen in the limbo. What better way than a cliffhanger ending.",1
48, Absolutely incredible! There has never been a movie completely like it and neither will there be again. Why do we dream? I think that is what Nolan is really exploring here. Any critic who doesn't like this movie should be sentenced to having to watch Grown Ups in their dreams for the rest of their existence. ;),1
49,"Its a crime that this only got a 74 metascore, so many people are trashing the special effects in this movie even though Christopher Nolan tried not to use CGI at all...",1
50,"What Nolan accomplishes is amazing, a film where the framework is so complex, the premise can stun the idle brain. I was blown away through the whole ride, from the performances, to the breathtaking visual effects. It really boils down to the strange and wonderful plot, a plot that stays with you long after the credits roll, and implications still haunt me.",1
51, Its the most real Nolan from ,1
52," The film was flat out amazing. The story was engaging, the characters riveting and the concept was intriguing.",1
53,"EVERYONE! Inception, was good. But......................................................................................................................................AHHHHH, MY BRAIN!! IT BURNS!",1
54," Look at those contrarian hater critics at the bottom. Get real. This is the best movie to come out of the Hollywood crap factory in a long, long time. Brilliant.",1
55," Amazing Movie, I have to say this is one of the best movie in recent years, Possibly best in this year, Everything is Perfect.",1
56,Think chess not checkers and you will enjoy it,1
57,Definitely the most innovative and original movie of the year with an amazing and metaphorical storyline along with sophisticated visuals that will keep you intrigued throughout the whole two and a half hours.,1
60," I honestly can't even begin to fathom how this ""film"" is getting the positive reviews that it seems to be getting. With such a rich set of tools to work with, a film in which literally ANYTHING can happen since it is set in a dream, you'd figure Nolan could have came up with something better than some folding streets and 3 or 4 9boring) storylines,",0
61,"After all the hype I found the film mildly dissapointing. I don't feel enough was done with the clever concept and the amount of gun fire was over the top. Despite this De Caprio does very well as does his side kick. However, this is not on the level of 'The Dark Knight'.",1
62,"I don't really want to explain much as you need to watch the film to understand but anyway, Inception is a  film, so if you're not prepared for that then don't watch it. Inception is somewhat similar to The Matrix as this film is based on dreams, and you understand more as the film plays out so it makes you think. The character development could had been better but it isn't that much of a problem. The action is kind of meh... The thrill of the film is what keeps you entertained.",1
63,"Christopher Nolan is no stranger to making movies that will send the audience in utter confusion (i.e Memento).  Inception  is one of the movies that will have audiences thinking long after the movie is over.  It will allow you to question your surroundings, and will cause you to question what reality truly is.  The production value of the film is incomprehensible as almost every aspect of the movie is fully-thought out.  Hans Zimmer has been the soundtrack producer for previous Nolan films, and here delivers a soundtrack that compliments the action and suspense of the movie as a whole.  Perhaps one of the highlights the film is the ensemble of actors. Within the ensemble are three Oscar nominated actors (Di Caprio, Page, Watanabe) and two winning individuals (Cotillard and Caine). There is no doubt that it is well-acted and it adds to the reality of the film, where in fact should be absent.  The minimal flaw in the film is that Nolan attempts to put too much to try to confuse its audience, but in the end this is just a small flaw in an immensely great film",1
64,It's not a masterpiece but is surely one of the most brilliant screenplay of the last 20 years! Great movie and great time passed watching it! My compliments to the director-screenwriter. 8.50,1
67, Excellent movie. Chris Nolan at his best. I was in need of a good mindf**k.,1
68," Christopher Nolan, has probably incepted my mind cause this movie is all i can think about",1
69," I could sit here all night telling you why this movie is probably the best movie I have ever seen, but that would be unnecessary. Simply put, go see this movie!",1
70,The best movie i have ever seen since the dark knight. nolan is no doubt the next stanley kubrick.,1
71,"The movie's plot may baffle the audience, but Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" dazzles us with powerful visuals, an ensemble cast, and mostly the director's mind blowing creativity.",1
72," Liked the depth of the main character. Want to see it again, but will watch it on Blu-Ray.",1
73,"Inception is one of the rare movies that you need to watch twice but can completely enjoy the first time.  Stunning visuals, great acting, and a superb setting more than enliven the complicated plot.  More importantly, Inception is truly unique.  Make no mistake, Inception is a heist movie.  In structure it is more similar to Ocean's Eleven than the Godfather.  Unlike other crime movies, however, it examines crime as part of the human condition endemic to even our dreams.",1
74,"This is one of the finest and most intriguing movies that I have ever seen.  It has been years since a Hollywood movie kept my attention from start to finish.  My hats off to Chris Nolan for restoring some of my faith in film.I am trying to pinpoint what really drew me into the story but am unable to even come close.  Sure the plot and sense of dream vs reality but it was more of the whole package.  Just about every aspect (including the film score, acting, and effects) was right on.  The movie was so intense for me that I literally said WOW at the end each time.  This is a movie that gets better with a 2nd viewing.  This film should be shining light to all the Hollywood establishment that they have the power to make great films.",1
75,"Probably the best psychological thriller of the decade, at least. It's not flawless, since different aspects of the movie will appeal to different personalities (for example, not everyone will be on the edge of their seat for a zero gravity fight scene), but yeah, definitely a complex and mind-boggling movie that's worthy of appreciation, if you're up for the challenge.  And, honestly, I was confused my first time watching this movie (maybe it had one too many layers), but it was much more clear the second time around fyi.",1
76," Wow. A masterpiece! how could some people dislike this?? it guess its like blade runner or 2001, which some people disliked. but wow, this was the best movie of the year, if not the decade.",1
77," The exponentially smart and puzzling ""Inception"" did a number on my brain. It's hard to describe a movie like this, you just have to see it for yourself!",1
78,The mindblower of all films.,1
79, A mindf**k. A meditation on the nature of reality vs. perception. One thing's for certain. It's a movie that each person will take something different away with them from.,1
80, Wow! this movie was unlike everything i have ever seen. now i know how people felt when they first saw 2001 or blade runner.,1
81,"  Saw it at midnight. Can't wait to see it again. Remarkable, novel, exciting masterpiece that is not to be missed. It's more of a heist film than a character driven piece, but as heist films go it's as intellectually awesome as it can possibly be.",1
83,"Not since The Matrix have I been this enthralled by a movie that happens inside the subconscious. Very cool film, smart, detailed but not confusing, and a great ending.",1
86," Inception was so awesome,with lots of dreams, awesome setting,cool visual effects,great characters,and mindless fun to watch that sucks into your mind!",1
87, Definitely the most innovative and original movie of the year with an amazing and metaphorical storyline along with sophisticated visuals that will keep you intrigued throughout the whole two and a half hours.,1
89,Like it's Idea of dream within a dream Inception is masterpiece within a masterpiece.Christopher Nolan's idea is unique and brilliant.The Director is in top form :).,1
90, One of the best movie i've ever seen,1
97,"This movie is proof that christopher nolan is on his way to joining the pantheon of masterful directors. this is the most complicated movie I have ever seen, while at the same time being completely original, and very entertaining. In this day and age, that is something truly incredible. I'm not sure yet if this is his best movie (a few more viewings will decide that), I didn't find it as fun as the Dark Knight or Memento, however, there is something remarkable about this movie that I cant quite put my finger on that really resonates with me. I cant give it a high enough recommendation. The one thing is it wont insult your intelligence, but it may make the mistake of assuming your a rocket scientist. And for you rocket scientists out there, fasten your seat belts, its going to be one hell of a ride.",1
98,"  An incredible movie in the best tradition of Hollywood. This movie demonstrates the great success that filmmakers can have when they dare to step outside the established ideas and ancient rehashed storylines and create something totally new and awesome. Yes, Inception takes from the best movies of recent history, but does so in an artful and thoughtful way. Nolan is building, not copying. The critics can say whatever gives them their jollies, but I loves the effects, I loved the storyline, I loved the characters and emotion, and I loved the ending. Hollywood, take note: This is how movies are made.",1
101," Thoughtful, with a great ensemble cast, carried without a misstep by Leonardo. A fantastic story with locations, action, and effects worthy of any Bond or Matrix offering. Not a dead minute in the entire 2+ hours. Film making on a grand and wonderful scale. Daring, confident, and beautiful. A must see. 9.5",1
103,"What makes ""Inception"" a summer blockbuster hit. One, the cast was amazing. Two, Christopher Nolan (The Director of ""The Dark Knight) wrote a fantasic screenplay. Three, the scenes in this film were ""Mind-Blowing!"" Inception is a fantasic, action/sci-fi thriller for anyone. I can't wait to purchase this on DvD.",1
104, Best movie I have seen since The Return of the King. Don't understand how someone can not like this movie. Has everything you want in a movie.,1
105," A film that can't be explained in words but only by Nolan's fantastic vision. That ending is overwhelmingly amazing,",1
106," Refreshing.... at the end of the movie people seemed mesmerized and gave it an honest, spontaneous standing ovation.",1
107, Great movie that keeps the mind moving the whole time.,1
109, A classic in the making... This is a film that will go down as one of the greatest films ever! I am not going to waste my time trying to explain the film to you guys as it is a film you just need to see! 10 Stars and one of the greatest films ever!,1
110," Man there are a lot of simpletons on here that seem to want to bash the movie only because it is a bit too complex for their liking. The movie was absolutely brilliant! The storyline was so intricate and well-woven only made better by the great cast that portrayed it. I saw it last night and I am still thinking about it. Sure there were a lot of gunfights and explosions and such, but the difference here was that I actually CARED about the people in the fights, and they were effectively used to tell the story. Don't let these haters sway you from seeing this movie, it's probably the smartest bit of entertainment that will be pumped out of hollywood in quite some time.",1
111, This movie was incredible. Best movie I've seen in years. Better than the Matrix. Chris Nolan really pulled off an unbelievable piece of directing and the story is absolutely amazing. Don't miss it!,1
112, I walked out. It was gibberish. Diarrhea. Any critic who liked this movie loses all credibility with me.,0
114,"""Inception"" is, technically speaking, a masterpiece. Surprisingly enough, the story and the screenplay in general are even more stunning than the visuals are! One is never quite certain what is going on - is it all a dream, or is it reality - which is the theme that goes across the whole film.With an amazingly original screenplay by director Christopher Nolan, it is hard for ""Inception"" to leave you without thinking. It is actually a rather engaging film, and I cannot imagine many people walking out from the film thinking that it did not offer food for thought, if nothing else.The visual effects are stunning, and in the same class as were the ones from ""The Matrix"" back in the day. Surely, it is not as breathtaking as ""Avatar"" was, but that was not it's intention in the first place. It is just visually a great film.The cast was also rather superb, especially DiCardo, Gordon-Levitt and Cottilard. Not really amazing performances, but definitely good and not over the top, which would have brought the quality of the film down.Christopher Nolan's direction and imagination are at it's peak - he has definitely surpassed ""The Dark Knight"" by far, with this film. Definitely a new masterpiece of cinema, that will leave no one apathetic.",1
115,"A very good movie that makes you think about dreams in a new way. I have talked to friends about dreams and the idea of controlling them, AND the idea of inception itself, and that's the kind of stuff that helps you know it's a good movie.",1
118,"Pros: Everything about the film. Cons: 0. After I saw this film, and was blown away by it, i went to check out some of Christopher Nolan's earlier films. So far I saw Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight, and Oh my god, Christopher Nolan is my favorite director now. All of his movies that ive seen are immensely good. Leonardo Dicaprio has come a long way since Blood Daimond and Shutter Island. Joseph Gordon Levitte isnt just a goofy love-sick guy like in 500 Days of Summer. And Hans Zimmer, I loved the films soundtrack. May we all bow in worship to Christopher Nolan",1
119,Great movie.  It's definitely a mind blower.  The whole story is fascinating. You can't leave the movie for popcorn though (you'll miss some interesting stuff).,1
120,"A film with dazzling technique, the real stars here are Christopher Nolan and his editor, Lee Smith. DiCaprio gives a fantastic, layered performance with a solid supporting cast around him. Hopefully the film and Nolan will be remembered come Oscar time.",1
121," I didn't like it. First and foremost the audio was horrible! I went and talked to the manager of the theater and he said that they were getting a lot of complaints and said that they just got a new sound system last month. One of the few movies that had me knodding off to sleep. If you asked me what this movie was about, I honestly could not tell you. I think I understood one sentence that was coming out of Ken Wanntanaba's mouth. I would not recommend this movie.",0
122," Possibly one of the most tedious movies I've ever seen. I looked forwards to seeing it, but after 20 minutes I wanted to leave, and I kept asking myself that every 10 minutes after that. Scores of giant plot-holes and lapses of logic; practically every other minute I saw something that didn't make sense. The entire premise doesn't make sense, because dreams aren't like reality: that's what makes them fascinating. But in Nolan's world, dreams look everyday, except for huge gigantic events that happen that get to be rendered in CGI. There wasn't much thought about this world he created, except how to make it bigger, flashier, and noisier. Think about real dreams - they're eerie and strange, and illogically logical. Bunuel captured them well; so also did The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. This was a boring world without any kind of sublety. The soundtrack was probably the worse I've every heard - a loud uberWagnerian rant that squelched any sense of real drama. The actors were fine, but since the script was full of idiotic lines, they couldn't win. And the ending was completely obvious - no surprises there.",0
123," One of the absolute worst movies I have EVER seen. Ive never been tempted to walk out of a movie before until seeing this pile of trash. Bad acting, lack of humanity and a convoluted plot not worth caring about. Simply awful movie.",0
124," Long, boring, and pretentious. It's sound and fury, signifying nothing.",0
125," This movie was just talky, boring nonsense that made me want to gouge out my eyeballs. While everyone around me seemed (or pretended) to understand the plot of this piece of crap, I sat there trying like hell to understand just what the f*** was going on. Also, who are these people...?? What ""agency"" do they work for...? And, the plot line between Cobb and his wife: also utterly contrived CRAP. I had no preconceived notions, but a lot of optimism about this movie. I feel very let down.",0
126," Louis D, you are suppossed to tell us why you gave this movie a 10, not scold people who disagree with you and found this movie to be crap crap crap. Don't be so insecure.",0
127,"Not only was this movie worth the 15 dollars in IMAX, but it was worth the 2 1/2 hours at midnight. Christopher Nolan found a way to make this movie both inherently believable and suspenseful. The subtle humor was extremely tasteful, and Leo's acting was impeccable. On the note of acting, Ellen Page's performance was incredible and very worthy of Best Supporting Actress. The rest of ...",1
128,"I think i was expecting too much from this movie. Christopher Nolan and Leonardo DiCaprio just sounded so awesome. The storyline was A LOT less confusing then i had hoped, but the average joe might have a bit of trouble with it. I would say this is his 4th best film and it's one of the best movies to come out this year.",1
129,"As with other Nolan movies there's a lot of sleight-of-hand in blinding you to the big plot holes. In the case of this movie, I found those holes genuinely bothersome. See this, there's lots to like, but so far, his masterpiece is still the Dark Knight.",1
130,"This movie was interesting from the beginning to the end, It had everything I look for in a movie deep characters interesting plot and deep enough story. The effects were amazing and it was just a damn good movie go see it!",1
131,"Best movie ive seen since the Dark knight! Amazing and original plot, amzing action sequences, and likeable characters! Its a must see movie! a masterpiece!",1
133,"Overrated?Almost certainly, but still an exceptional movie, if only for the concept and presentation. This is certainly worth at least one viewing, but i'd say to really get the plot you'd need to see it a few times, this won't effect your enjoyment of the movie though. The effects are very well done and at times breath taking. Characters were mostly pretty shallow, although i thought DiCaprio's character was surprisingly and intriguingly complex.Definitely recommend, will be buying on blu-ray for certain.",1
135,"Best film of the year.  The architecture is just fabulous.  The concept of entering another person's dream to plant an idea is remarkably creative.  It may be science fiction now, but maybe it isn't. DeCaprio has been making a living as a mercenary, entering othe people's dreams and extracting ideas, information wanted by his employers.  He is challenged to plant an idea by a businessman who wants the heir to a conglomerate to diverse his company, when he inherits.  Leo's character has to assemble a team of experts to accomplish this task.  Does he do it? The viewer must be ready to concentrate and engross themselves for over two hours, otherwise, like a bathroom break, and you come back completely confused. This is one of the best films I've seen in over 60 years.",1
136,"An amazing movie showcasing an interesting plot that immerses you right until the end, it's theme - arguably the strongest Inception has going for it - is dreams and i was left satisfied with how said subject matter was treated without dumbing it down in typical Hollywood style. The pacing is outstanding and will always lead you into that next scene at just the right time, my only qualm with this movie was the choice to ratchet it into action country during the back end.",1
137,"I know what you guys are thinking. Yes. I did saw this movie in theaters in Fredricksburg, VA but only once and I don't why I haven't seen it again until my stepfather bought a DVD copy of this movie. So I watched it on the plasma screen TV and really enjoyed it. To my shocking surprise, this movie is in my Top 14 favorite movies of 2010 with a creative atmosphere about dreaming in reality, excellent acting, Top-Notch action scenes, a magnificent all-star casting including Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and more, and the most important thing about this movie: the superb visuals throughout the whole movie. At my highest hopes, this movie deserves a 9/10.",1
138,"The best movie this year! Christopher Nolan has made one of his finest movies of all time! Expect  this having a lot of Oscar nominations!  This movie will blow your mind! Christopher Nolan  this movie that extracts great  film making, art and mind dreaming. If you had to choose the movie of the year, this would be the one you were looking for!",1
139,"Yep. I fell for it. The whole idea really sucks me in. How can you not be interested in such an original and mind-bending idea? It's also supported by incredible visuals and some unsung strong acting by the cast, especially Ellen Page",1
140,"Brilliant, genius and original. hard for me to understand the movie the first time i watched it, but i felt this movie was something different, so i watched it again and then i understood it. Full of imagination and the acting was super. love it!",1
143,I bow before the brilliance of Christopher Nolan.  My favorite movie of 2010 and easily one of my favorite movies of the last ten years.  An absolutely flawless piece of film making.,1
149," Was expecting a lot more from this film.  My overall feeling is that Nolan has intentionally and pretentiously complicated the whole plot, forcibly added a lot of unnecessary elements and scenes in order to make it a ""big"" movie.  Would have been much better if kept simpler.  The role played by Ellen Page was a total mis-cast as she seemed to be completely out of place. My 2 stars go to DiCaprio. ",0
150,"THIS movie is completely overated. Watercooler prestige for those who sit through & pat theirsleves on the back at oh what smarty pants they are. This movie is crap that drags and is no where near as intersting as the nap & dream I took before it ended. Dreams are abstract, impossible to set up house in, one persons flying burritos and chairs with ship sails makes sense to them only. Original? Ive seen better folding cities in the Matrix and Dark City.Its down right sad that spew like this and Monsters are loved by critics and yuppies everywhere when their comlplete dribble and will only contribute to the horrible drought of anything decent. DO yourself a favor rent Dark City & skip this nap maker.",0
151,everybody hyped this movie up so much but man were they wrong this is one of the slowest moving most boring movies I've ever seen what little action is in it is good but I could barely keep my eyes open waiting for something to happen,0
152,"Extremely overhyped, no actual intellectual content. Good if you want to pretend that you're watching an intelligent movie without actually having to use your brain. For those who enjoy actual stories with characters you care about or original ideas with relevance over pretentious, overthought, and purposely ""complex"" (not really) crap, this movie should be avoided. Unless you're a wannabe intellectual, don't watch this. Action scenes would earn it a 5 (it's actually a decent popcorn movie), but amount of hype and intended audience make it get a 0 from me.",0
153,"The film is both ill conceived and ill produced mess.  It's to be expected that Hollywood will throw awards upon efforts which appear to be smart, though really aren't.  I enjoyed Batman Begins.  Memento was ok, but highly over-rated for the same reasons.  This thing was nothing but a painful POS.  An offensive turd.",0
154," Was looking forward to watching this movie so got me a ticket. The movie is about people working for an organisation thalt go into other peoples dreams to steal data. Movie goes on forever and is both boring and confusing and full of filler, only gave it a 2 for special effects.",0
155," I'm sorry, I understood this movie the first time. There was nothing to understand. A guy goes into a dream, then goes into another dream, then goes into another dream, then he may have died in one dream, while living an eternity in another, or the whole thing was one big dream, or parts of his psyche are sleeping while other parts are awake, and the whole thing might be an endless torrent of cognitive disruption. Either way, Nolan did nothing new. And don't get me started about that cross-cutting bs. Have you seen Time Code? Okay, so there are people have done what Nolan has done before. If you only read the review, you are going to buy the hype because that's all there is, is hype.",0
156," Why do I keep forgetting how overrated Christopher Nolan is? Why all the praise? Please, someone explain. MEMENTO is brilliant, but that's it. I respect him for his ambitious productions, but his post-Memento writing & directing skills are ...mediocre at best. He has the mind of a pretentious mathematician, and his films are cold, soulless, and without heart. The ""romance"" in this film is more like an intellectual exercise. The characters are stiff, and speak glib 50's dialogue. This surreal heist story is too convoluted for its own good, and I don't enjoy experiencing a story through constant explanation. I understood (most of) it, but there is a difference between 'understanding' and 'feeling'. I didn't feel the forced stakes in this film. I wasn't invested in the characters until nearly the end. There are some interesting moments and a couple of daring ideas. A few really cool visuals... but not as many as I was expecting (all are revealed in the trailers). Overall, the majority of the film left me bored and unengaged. The last half hour picks up, but not enough to reverse course. Dammit, I am obligated to see the next Batman film. But after that, someone please remind me how I feel about Nolan.",0
157," Disjoineted plot. Could not carel less about the characters. Stale dialogue and nothing interesting. Director trying to be clever by confusing audience, so when the end comes you sit and wonder what the hell you just saw.",0
158, There is a great idea for a film here. Too bad the film they made is so terrible.,0
159," An absurd and boring movie. Remember being 8 years old and writing a story with the ending ""...but it was all a dream""? Inception is similar, but tells you that it's all a dream right from the start, thereby making it impossible to become emotionally involved in the plot, and therefore the characters. Ken Watanabe's acting is appalling. Don't waste 10 bucks going to see this.",0
160," Whoever is giving this film high marks is either a TDK Nolan fan, or a moron. Even from an objective Nolan fan it deserves maybe a 5 at the most. I give it a 2 because in comparison to his other movies, this one was weak, convoluted, oddly structured, and didn't have enough originality to keep me rooted. People who say it is imaginative should go rent the Matrix and Existenz and the Thirteenth Floor. I mean if imaginative is ""extracting"" other people's ideas, then I guess this movie was imaginative.",0
162," To be honest, I've been on metacritic for many years, looking to this site as a sort for reviews. To decide the films I choose to watch, I use a combination of what the critics say plus the user reviews. In all my time here, i've NEVER felt obliged to sign up to leave a review. This movie was pure fantastic in film form. It's a bit of a mind-bender, as it deals with consciousness and reality on multiple levels, through the state of dreaming, but if you go in with an open mind and pay attention, you'll love the entire experience, from start to finish. I do highly suggest seeing it in IMAX, it makes the experience everso that much better. Happy viewing all!",1
163," I am what you'd call a movie buff, and this is the best movie I've ever seen. I can't recommend or elaborate any more, go see it, seriously. It doesn't deserve the 1-10 scale so instead of looking at the number of my rating just know you need to go see this movie.",1
165," In my Top 10 of worst movies and most overhyped of all time. It is so scary how the critcs and the viewers think this is a good, smart movie when it is boring, long, confusing. I don't know what other movies you have all seen, but you must not have seen many good movies in your time. Music was horrible, way too much dialogue, too much exposition. Lots of crying going on but I wasn't emotionally attached to any characters. Action, which was very little, was too confusing. You don't know who is who or doing what. Joseph Gordon Levitt was wasted in this and Ellen Page miscast.",0
166,The movie had great special effects but it was lacking in its plot.The director should tell us more about this dream technique and if he wanted to confuse us he should try something different because the only thing he succeeded is to make us throw up.,1
167,"It was a masterpiece.  One of the best films I've ever seen, and quite possibly, the best.  It has everything you can possibly ask for.  Smart, original, emotional, and utterly ambitious, Inception is the best film of 2010, and yes, it is better than The Dark Knight.  Anyways, take a ""leap of faith"" and go experience the unforgettable masterpiece that is Inception.  A 10/10.",1
169,"""Inception is one of the most provocative films i have ever seen , DiCaprio gives a stunning performance , But at times this movie can be to complex to handle , and Drags at times & be confusing , but beside that this movie is a masterpiece"" ... B+",1
170,"This is a review within a review that's trapped inside another review.  Only a defibrillator can release the real score within my subconscious. So I improvised and reconstructed a score of zero based upon my memories of other movies like Glitter, Ishtar and My Giant.",0
171,"Wow!  What a tedious, confusing, mess!  I have loved many movies with dreamlike sensibilities--""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Twelve Monkeys,""  and ""Brazil"" come to mind--movies which prompt the viewer to question reality and ponder their place in the universe.  ""Inception"" is clearly attempting to be one of these movies, but it fails miserably.   Piling layer upon layer of plot and exposition doesn't make a movie more ""intelligent"" or ""thought-provoking,"" but that is what director Christopher Nolan seems to be doing.  Instead of provocative, metaphysical sci-fi we get scene after scene that resemble outtakes from ""Mission Impossible 12.""  None of it adds up to much, except that is, for confusion and boredom.  Sure, there are some awe-inspiring CGI sequences of dream worlds folding over onto themselves, and edifices collapsing into nothing, but mostly what we get is meaningless, uninspired action and head-scratching explanations about the why these convoluted events are occurring.  If I cared even a little bit about these characters, maybe I could forgive the filmmakers for some (though certainly not all) of the ridiculous plot contortions, but I didn't.",0
172,"Clearly over thought concept, blockbuster budget and all star cast list makes the film feel like its trying too hard to impress. Nolan desperately tries to make the film awe inspiring with genius seeping out of every crevice of  the plot. Unfortunately this is all counter productive, making for a very laborious and lacklustre watch.",0
173,A complicated mix of a twisted drama.,0
174,"Just a heap of excruciatingly long and dull action sequences that drag on and on, and in between them there's pseudo-intellectual explanatory dialogue that has no life or feeling to it. That's the whole movie.It's amazing what this generation views as a ""masterpiece"", a movie with no real plot or story, no character development, depth, or emotional engagement; just boring scenes that play out like a video game, ""Complete this dream level... now on to the next dream level..."" It has no soul, it's a borefest from start to finish. True as some say, it has awesome special effects, but so do cologne commercials. When will people understand that special effects don't make a movie? And to anyone saying it's a ""smart"" movie; that understanding it makes you more intelligent than people who don't; trust me on this, you're an idiot. There was huge hype surrounding this film, you were told how it's targeted at the intellectuals, how ""it's not a movie for everyone"", and the goal of this was to convince simpletons like you that understanding the plot makes you intelligent, and that anyone who didn't like it was because he's too stupid to understand it. That couldn't be further from the truth, you are a complete idiot as you are unable to see when people are playing mind tricks on you. I can't help but to think how they laughed at all the people who bought into the hype they created, how they made people overlook what a boring piece of trash they made with simple psychological marketing. tl;dr: This movie was made to make stupid people feel smart.",0
175,"This is not just Nolan's weakest film to date, I feel it's one of the most overpraised movies of this century. Inception has got to be the most insultingly superficial and unimaginative depiction of the human mind ever put to celluloid. The characterisation is terrible. In fact there is no characterisation. Nothing is revealed about the supporting characters. Their motivations and intentions are left blank and there's not a shred of humanity in any of them. Half the characters have only one task - to explain the plot to the audience. It almost feels like Nolan distributes the expository dialogue among the unimportant characters and saves the actual bit for the important characters. They're merely subjects to experimentation. And Nolan still doesn't know how to write adult women. Nolan's women tend to be ruled by their lady feelings before ultimately capitulating to the men around them. Mal is, by far, the worst example (so far). Anne Hathaway's Brandt would be second. And this is where Nolan's exposition spins wildly out of control. He spends the first half dictating all the rules of the dreamland and then spends the other half dictating how to break all these rules. And why do all these dreams feel like James Bond movies? I never understood why Inception is soooo action oriented. It almost feels like a video game at times. And there's not a shred of depth to it. I keep asking myself ""why did nolan go to such great lengths to make this movie? what is he trying to convey through it?"" And the answer is nothing. He's just created a world with no ideas. That's why the movie feels so cold and mechanical. And keep in mind Nolan is often praised for dealing with dark philosophical ideas (especially in Memento and his first 2 batman movies) but Inception doesn't bother with that. It's not just superficial, it's pretentious. This is the perfect example of a film that can fool people into thinking it's profound and deep. It's not.",0
176," Would have given this a zero, but gave it a 1 since I was able to catch a good nap during it. What a wanna be metaphysical bunch of crap! The only way to enjoy this movie is if you were dreaming while you were watching it.",0
178," Worst movie of 2010. Terribly confusing, bloated, overlong. Music is horrible, Ellen Page is mis-cast. Best Picture worthy? Must be a bad year for movies. Dialogue goes on and on and on. Too much expostion, confusing action scenes. Did I mention boring? Indifferent acting, none of the plot makes sense.",0
179, Inception tries to be clever but gets bogged down in over complex dialogue constantly having to explain itself. It seems to be inventing its plot as it goes along in order to fit as much dream mumbo jumbo as possible. When the 'guru' in the opium den dream theatre refers to his 'addicted dreamers' and announces - who's to say whether or not their dreams are reality or not in other words - are we therefore in the dream - I got up and walked out - if I wanted that kind of teenage logic I ll go and watch Nightmare on Elm Street.,0
180," Overated and over complicated. Never has such a talented cast gone to such waste.... none of the characters had any depth and the story telling was non-existent. Its hard to fathum what people enjoyed about this movie and how Nolan has gained such a big reputation. I went to see this movie with friends - had I been alone I would have left the theatre 50 mins into the film. Never have I been so disinterested in the outcome of a movie. The hero (Di Caprio) explains that you can never remember the beginning of a dream, and that dreams that seem to cover hours may only last a short time. Unfortunately, this nightmare last a full 2 1/2 hours!!",0
181," Folks, this the first movie I've ever walked out of half-way through. If you like a confusing plot, typical Hollywood visions of urban destruction, complete with large-calibre handguns killing people randomly and disjointed rambling dialogue by cut-out characters... you'll love this movie.",0
182, Lisa M is spot on. For a film to depict dream content in such a prosaic and visually unimaginative way -- especially given the budget available to Mr. Nolan -- is a major failure.,0
183,"The story of this movie is one that  is not realistic whatsoever and it's not interesting in any way either. The movie itself is so boring it made me hope it would end soon. I think there is one joke in this movie and there are 2 smiles. It is a complex story partly because everything takes so long to explain itself. I really had a bad night at the cinema,. Nolan's style is really horrible if you ask me. That's my honest opinion.",0
184," If this movie makes someone think, they probably haven't had many thoughts before. Basically recycled ideas wrapped in some boring nonsense (""exposition"") intercut with action sequences that aren't even that spectacular and quite boring CGI. Whoever thinks these ideas are fresh, needs to read more and watch better movies -- Existenz, World on a Wire, Dark City, The Thirteenth Floor, Matrix, even something like Last Year at Marienbad which manages to have complex ideas about memory and human mind and complex arresting visuals before CGI even existed. As to the originality of the visuals -- the New York Times reviewer was too kind to the movie but he was right -- dreams and the subconscious aren't that literal and obvious. If the subconscious was so literal, it wouldn't be the subconscious. And the visuals in something as crappy as ""The Cell"" were much more interesting.",0
185,"We went because we enjoyed Memento, once we read a 3 page analysis of it; and Metacritic's high ""score"".  But it was a disappointment.  Where Memento was confusing but clever, and, once comprehended, brilliant.......Inception is confusing and boring, and way too long.  The entire Alpine dream could have been eliminated with affecting the story line.  Who was shooting who, anyway, and besides, who cares?  I actually dozed off during this sequence.   The chases scenes were also overdone and relatively uninteresting because it didnt much matter who got hit and who didnt.  It is a dream, after all.  The CGI is clearly clever and the links between the physical world and their effect on the dream world, amusing.  But visionary? No.  Entertaining?  Only briefly.",0
186," This movie was utter garbage. If there were no Dark Knight, none of you would care a lick about Nolan or Inception.",0
187, You guys are nuts. You really want to believe this is the best movie ever? This movie was shallow as a kiddie's pool.,0
188,"was like a writing exercises by Nolan.Lacks depth in the characters and action sequences were poor,could have been better if Nolan gave more emphasis on direction department",0
189," Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Hey, can one of you guys who liked this movie so much, pay me for my lost time?",0
190,A tedious and unoriginal spectacle. Completely saturated with blindly complementary hype and build up but I'm afraid it didn't take the biscuit. Perhaps a film for ITV 4 in 5 years at 10 on a Wednesday night - but truly undeserving of mass takings at box office,0
192,"Christopher Nolan's labyrinth of a movie is likely the most complex action movie ever conceived, shifting between as many as four parallel settings at once and constantly bending any notion of reality, while still convincing the audience that everything going on makes sense. Trying to explain the movie would probably end in a horrible mess, but with the aid of superb writing and masterful editing, Nolan turns his psychotic idea into a smooth, polished vision that is enjoyable on every level it aims for.",1
193,Go see the Matrix - again - and save your effort. Same movie as Matrix but now takes place inside a dream. Really unoriginal. Drags on far too long. This movie never should have been made.,0
194,"Talk about the emperor's new clothes, Nolan's oeuvre is the emperor's whole wardrobe. Although i did like Batman Begins, Inception, like that last Batman film is a big convoluted mess. Having read many complex narrative and metafiction novels, i love complexity when it's delivered by a talented artist with a capacity to deliver, Nolan can't. Who cares about richy rich and his dying father? Who cares about the ""kicks"" being executed? And the security in the unconscious is paramilitary shootouts? What!? That is devoid of imaginations. Why aren't we seeing Leo's relationship with his wife? That might be a film. But Nolan has never shown any capacity to reveal intimacy so i shouldn't be too surprised.",0
195,"Brilliant concept, but so much action and violence it just seemed tiring after a while.  This apparently is the only ""reality"" Hollywood knows how to produce, even with the opportunity to go ""three layers deep"".  Not hard to follow or understand if you were paying attention.  It was ""disappointing"".  I thought it offered something on a deeper level.  It's just a *movie* NOT a ""film"".  Kind of felt I wasted 2 hours of ""real"" time being I am used to films on a much deeper level that don't rely on action, violence and a bunch of shoot-em-up-bang-bang to take one through the movie's concept.  Granted its better than most Hollywood movies out there, but still disappointing that it wasn't more on its own without following typical movie footsteps - you'll know what this means by the end of the movie.  That's the idea I hope gets out there to save us from more disappointment.",0
196,"No offense, because we all have been 12 years old, but the only way you can consider this film mind blowing, smart, creative and blah blah blah is if you are 12 or below. I give it 3 points because of the city landscape and some well done effects. Everything else is quite vague and boring.",0
197,"A horrible movie. I don't really care if I didn't comprehend it, it still wasn't interesting to watch. There have been plenty of movies that had complex story lines that I still found intriguing to watch. It was so boring. The only semi good thing was the music. Too long to.",0
199," Overly complex and hard to understand. I want to be entertained by a movie, not challlenged to see if I can keep up with the plot. And then, at the end, is an overdone James -Bond like scene with snow and a military fortress, which has no meaning at all. Even all the senseless gunfire is not entertaining at all. I want my money back.",0
200, Easily one of the worst movies ever made.,0
202," Brilliant, masterful tedium. Never before has so much genuine talent and expertise been applied to the film making process with such dull and dismal results. Inception should get an award just for that. Someone please take away the big hollywood money Mr. Nolan has to work with. The more money he gets, the worse his movies are.",0
203,"What ""Inception"" does best is prove how superb of a director Christopher Nolan really is. He creates his own fantasy world with its own rules, problems, and strategies without either boring or (for the most part) confusing his audiences. The movie is really not all the much of a **** it simply moves quickly and surefootedly because it has to. The film explains the dream universe so well in the first act that we almost always know what's going on later in the film, though it is rarely explained distinctly. The visuals are  dazzling and the action can be intense, but ultimately this is a film of philosophy and theologies, rather than the usual summer blockbuster. One of 2010's best films.",1
206,"What is a good story? How can we bring all the essential elements of a story into a movie without damaging other parts of that movie . A story in general is based on several important elements. Good characters, good line of activities, the ability of handling a proper language , point of view, variable plot, and the acceptable details of all circumstances , plus the location and the most reliable one, the evolution and the movement of that story. This mentioned aspect ,[evolution] is well brought in this movie and thatâ",1
208,"Few movies go for the feel that Inception brings to the table- the story revolves around, ""Dream Thieves,"" who get hired by people to go into the sleeping minds of others to retrieve information. As the move goes on the main character explains the rules of the dream world, and how time gets slower the more layers you go down. Near the start of the movie, the main character and his team are hired to preform an elaborate performance on a CEO's son to get him to cancel his company. I have to say, when they are doing the dream theft it is pretty sweet- it might remind you of The Dark Knight in terms of awesomeness. The story of the movie seemed fairly strong, and I liked how they developed the main character, but they didn't seem to develop the rest of the team enough, which was a bit of a disappointment. But the ending will leave you wondering, something I loved about the movie. If you enjoyed Nolan's previous films (Batman Begins, Dark Knight) or some of DiCaprios recent appearances, this is a good film for you.",1
209,"Wow that was... amazing.  Every second I was sitting at the edge of my seat, wating for the next plot twist.  A film of this quality is not normal; do yourself a favor a watch it twice",1
210,"This is not a film, this is an experience. Stunning visual effects and an intelligent script make Inception your classic summer blockbuster with a twist: it is actually intelligent. The score is beautiful, and Nolan does his usually fantastic job directing. By the end of the film, you will be questioning reality, and most importantly, you will be wondering if it stopped spinning.",1
211,"Great movie, an action/science fiction movie with an intelligent plot that will have you talking about it way after the credits finish. Leonardo DiCaprio is the best actor in the business today period.",1
212,"It's such an original film. It isn't confusing or hard to understand if you actually watch it, pay attention and listen. It's all about dreams within dreams and the film is a bit like a game. You're introduced to the concepts used within it and then the film starts. Must watch.",1
213,What makes Inception so great is how much thought has gone into it. You need to see it twice to fully understand it. It's brilliantly directed by Nolan and the acting was even better. This is going to stay in my top 5 movies for a very very long time.,1
214,"Inception have the best original idea i have ever seen and Nolan execute it to the level of perfection, it's a masterpiece in all it's elements.the visuals are the best thing i have ever seen.the performances are spectacular and the plot is imaginary.i never gave a movie 10 out of 10 before but inception easily deserve it.",1
215,"Even if you watch 9/11 tapes while reading conspiracy theories on the internet and listening to Silencer, you won't have a more depressing, humorless, dull, pseudo-complex, deadly serious experience than Inception. This movie proves that Chris ""Just doin' it for money"" Nolan doesn't know what a joke is. His daddy raised him to be a true no-nonsense businessman, and businessmen can never lighten up! They also cannot make art, they can make only carefully engineered, emotionally inept, heartless blockbusters.",0
216,"The popularity of Inception is an example of not only people being unable to tell the difference between style and substance, but of not even being aware that substance exists. America's cultural hostility to thinking and feeling has led to the popularity of these utterly mind-numbing movies, but Inception is a new low, where you watch it and pretend you have just seen something smart.",0
217,"The winner in the category ""The dullest depiction of dreams ever"". Add to that boring characters who are in the movie just to explain the plot, and also they talk and think a lot faster than an average viewer. This and plot's unnecessary complexity can pass as something intellectual nowadays, I guess. Though I seriously doubt that a truly intellectual movie can be praised and understood by the majority. Nolan is good on a technical side but he is so unimaginative he needs to collab with someone more creative asap. I'm tired of seeing him fail.PS: I wanted to score it 2 but Metacritic went full retard and scored it 0 against my will",0
218,"First of all, Cillian Murphy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Leonardo DiCaprio should never be cast as adults in films. They are far too small of stature and too baby-faced to be believable in adult roles. Personally, I’ve never bought the Leonardo DiCaprio tough-guy persona, as hard as I have tried. Ellen Page looks like Howdy Doody’s twin sister with her porcelain skin, chubby cheeks and billboard-sized forehead…creepy, and yet she is often cast as an ""attractive woman"". At least Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard and Tom Hardy looked like real human beings while trying desperately to dignify a terrible storyline and a stupid, stupid script.If you’re ready for 2 ½ very long hours of watching all the actor’s urgently shouting things at each other and intensely explaining the scientific narrative so that the audience isn’t completely lost, shoot yourself up with some Novocain and see if you can make it all the way through without sticking a pencil in your eye and/or your ear.The special effects and animation were fairly impressive but not nearly enough to carry the film.",0
219," What a waste of time & film. As we left the movie we asked what did the people understand about the movie - confusion is probably the best reply. Your critics' review system ""blew"" this one - bummmer.",0
220," One note movie-- mostly an unvarying level of all- out action throughout, and loud, bombastic soundtrack too, so it gets more and more boring to sit through. Not all dream sequences needed to be like Nazi horror dreams; but the few scenes in which Nolan introduced less noisy interactions were short and not very engaging. Not for thoughtful viewers.",0
221, I thought the plot was boring and gimmicky. The characters lacked depth. The whole movie felt like a collection of trite special effects.,0
222," One of the worst movies of the year. Unoriginal, non- inspiring performances. Very thin story. Very slow moving. Effects were cool, but have been done numerous times before. The Matrix blows this movie away. Nothing new here. Very predictable. Knew how it would end a half hour in. If you are intelligent, avoid this one!",0
223," Completely ridiculous story with a thousand flaws in logic, compounded by the fact that it's completely impossible to follow. Two hours of my life I wish I could have back. Total waste of the gazillion dollars they spent making this baloney. Save your money!",0
224," Warning: this movie is basically two-and-a-half hours of talky, pretentious exposition intercut with boring, generic summer-blockbuster-gunfight/car-chase action scenes. (Also, the good guys here are armed with the same Magic Hollywood Bullets that enable one nearsighted cowboy to singlehandedly kill a hundred Indians.) As for ""visually stunning,"" don't believe the hype---it's the same now-familiar CGI crap you've seen everywhere from ""The Matrix"" to car commercials on network TV.",0
225, This film has made ma lose my faith in humanity. I thought movie goers would be intelligent enough to see through this drivel.,0
226, Toy Story 3 is way better.,0
227, Absolute crap. You critics have lost all credibillity with me. And those that like it. Obviously you are not in reality.wake up!!!,0
228,"Can't for the life of me figure out why this movie got such high ratings. Another movie rigged by reviewers to get people in seats. DO NOT SEE THIS IN THEATERS. Wait for the DVD if you must. The plot is stupid and confusing, the characters are annoying and far-fetched, the premise is so unbelievable it boggles the mind. Whoever came up with this should be shot. The dream sequences are just excuses to use some CGI effects and basically stray from reality as much as possible, and OMG but I had NO IDEA my dreams could be so vivid and real, to the point where you can arrange heists and kidnappings and create  'projections' that can actually kill you. I've never sat through so much nonsense in my life. This is a poorly written movie. If M. Knight had of written this it would've been viciously attacked, in stark contrast to the rave reviews and high ratings this has received so far. I will never get that hour and a half back. What a waste.",0
229,"Never in my many years of going to the movies have I ever felt like walking out. NEVER. And I've seen a lot of bad movies. This movie is, without a doubt, the single WORST movie I have ever seen. It's film garbage. It has no soul.Hated it.",0
230,"Ridiculous, and ridiculously boring. No character development, no authentic emotion: Nolan gives you no reason to even CARE. Little by way of original ideas, or original film making. And the screenplay! 99.9% pure drivel. In all, it's a crappy movie inside a mindless movie inside a pretentious movie inside a boring movie. Skip it.",0
233," To all you critics and viewers that are giving this movie rave reviews, I ask, did we see the same movie? The music drove me insane, the acting was un-inspired, the plot was chaotic and confusing, the dialogue was excessive and boring and the characters were emotionally empty.",0
234,"Okay, Let me first start by saying that Christopher Nolan spent 10 years writing this film, so right from the start this film must be worth watching. This isn't your ordinary psychological thriller, it's not something where you can guess the next scene or assume how it will end. A lot of films these days often seem to be recycled, whether they are sequels, remakes, or inspirations from other films. ""Inception"" however, is pure original and it's evident almost from the beginning. The style, music, the entire concept. It is structured in such a way that it seems like it makes a lot of sense than it actually does, as always with anything that is maze-like. Let's just say that when Christopher Nolan was creating ""Memento"" he was warming up. I personally feel ""Inception"" is his best work yet.Read full review at FlicksWorthWatching.com",1
235, Such a boring movie...good effects but movie is sucks.,0
236,"TERRIBLE, it falls, to damn complicated for sal to understand probably because he smells bad davinchi goes into 4th sleep relm and **** ERVEY were thank you",0
237, Reading the reviews definitely gives you an idea why the world is so messed up! How anyone can think this movie was worth the admission price is beyond me! This movie STUNK! Everytime there had to be an explanation of a prblem in a dream sequence it made up bizarre rules! DiCaprio better start being a bit more selective on the scripts he chooses or he will be making 'Made for TV' movies very soon!,0
238," Boring. Boring. Boring. This movie didn't have enough action. The action scenes aren't even memorable. Parts of the film, such as the use of mental time dilation, are ripe for parody already. I kept thinking... haven't I seen this film before? Stupid.",0
239," In years to come, when we look back on the medium of film and the incredible power it possesses, this will be the current generation's defining masterpiece. Nolan has crafted an outstanding piece of art, which perfectly encapsulates the concept of the dream and its ability to question our view of reality. From the spectacular visuals to its collection of fantastic performances, Inception is Nolan's finest piece to date and a prime example of the endless limits of cinema. Sheer brilliance.",1
240," THis movie was so bad for me I wouldn't have stayed past the first 40 minutes if I had been watching it alone. It didn't set up the plot at all. Like you were just supposed to accept on this intense chasing and shooting without ever knowing why just to be set up for the big dream sequence in the end. I thought the end was MUCH MUCH better, but getting there was painful and infuriating. Not a joy to watch and not well developed as a story.",0
241," One of the BEST movies I have ever seen! I was completely blown away by Marion Cotillard, she played the part so well and i was completely mystified by her elegance. Leo was fantastic, as always, and I was very impressed by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performances. Overall this movie was great! I already saw it twice and i might just have to see it again!",1
242, Quite possibly the best film I've ever seen. Engrossing throughout and compulsory to re-watch.,1
243," One of the best films I've seen in a long time. This is a film that doesn't really go away from you when you're done watching it, and makes you think deeply. Certainly a film that should be seen multiple times to fully understand and love it even more.",1
244, Pure enjoyment from start to finish. An awe inspiring movie.,1
245," This movie has Stunning Visuals, a stirring storyline and a Captivating Narration. What more?",1
246, Like a mix of The Matrix and Ocean's Eleven... A fantastic (if at times confusing) film where reality is not as certain as you might think.,1
247," THis movie is flawless. It is original and gripping. If you don't like this movie it means you got confused watching it, which is really sad because I feel like Christopher Nolan handed us a road map and gave us ""YOU ARE HERE"" updates every 5 minutes.",1
248," A Modern Movie Masterpiece!! I saw this movie today (7/17) in IMAX with a packed theater and have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan delivers his finest and most audacious film yet. It is the story of an extractor (DiCaprio) a thief who breaks into dreams. He gets cornered into his largest job yet, to break into a businessman's (Murphy) dream and plant information in his mind. To protect the film's twists and turns, I will stop there. The direction is frightening. For a filmmaker to get into our head and make us question reality and fantasy on the screen is almost like controlling our mind. This is what Nolan achieves, and to top it off, his actors give such convincing and realistic performances that we almost feel like we are in the dream with them. Some critics, and they know who they are: Rex Reed and company, who have panned the film believe that Nolan focused on visuals rather than the story and characters, but that is absolute insanity. It should be clear to any viewer that the story and characters are the real effect here. The visuals are amazing, but to be honest, they are supporting the story. They are no ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Jurassic Park"", they aren't that effective. But unlike those two films, they play a psychological role in ""Inception"". I would be shocked if AMPAS didn't nominate the superb Wally Pheister's cinematography, Hans Zimmer's haunting score, Christopher Nolan's direction, Marion Cotillard's emotional performance, and the supurb editing at the least. The film is more than Best Picture worthy, but given AMPAS's history of nominating films like ""The Blind Side"", ""The Reader"", and ""Moulin Rouge"" rather than the critically acclaimed films, I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't get nominated come next year. Not a safe bet, but I do say with the lack of acclaimed and intelligent films this year it should get a Best Picture nomination. See This Film! The ending is amazing, and if you have at least an 8th Grade reading comprehension level (unlike Rex Reed and Company) you will come back to the theater wanting more and scratching your head. Enjoy!",1
249," I thought this was brillant, great story, brillant acting and a great ending that will have people talking bout this movie for years to come. Nolan has become the greatest director of his genaration mabye one more great film and he could be called best ever, di caprio continues his journey to be up there with the greatest. speacial mention for Jospeh gordon-levitt who is such an underated actor hopefully will be recognised up there with di caprio after this. see it for yourself make up your own mind for me possible one of the greatest movies ever made.",1
250, A Masterpiece.,1
251, This movie sucks it makes no sense at all .they risks their lives to go in three layers dream for what?. so he can his father saying I disappointed that you try to be me.to find out his father wants him to be his own man. this a piece of crap. I want my money back. If you able to go in three layers of dream you shoud come up with something more important than this piece of shit.,0
252," It sucked. I knew after the first 5 minutes. I wanted to reach out and grab one of those cuffs to put on my arm to go into a ""dream-like state"" until the movie was over. Don't waste your money ($11.00 btw) or your time.",0
253," Horrible dialogue, and character development that simply made the movie boring. Yeah I could keep up with the plot but was I supposed to care? Wanted to leave an hour in.",0
254,Fantastic and horribly flawed.,1
255," Honestly. I didn't expect much of this movie, but when it finished I just wanted to watch it again. The movie was just superb! And the special effects also! The one thing I kinda didn't like was the ending, because you don't know what to think, but although anyone is free to think what they want, I think that in the next moment it would fall.",1
256," This is simply a true master-piece, it will also create a path for future film-makers to follow, its original and full of little details that will help you understand (or confuse) completely the plot. One of those movies that you want/have to watch over and over again.",1
257," Visually stunning, psychologically moving.",1
258," The more it sinks in, the more I admire Inception. One of the most original movies I have ever seen and complex on so many levels (the art of movie-making, questions of reality, existentialism, etc). Or perhaps this idea was just implanted in my head over night while I was asleep..",1
259,  Inception is Nolan's latest perfection. It's twists and turns will have you slamming in to the back of your seat in amazement.,1
260,One hell of a thrilling ride into the human subconscious.,1
261," I think, like lost, people expect answers and dismiss anything else. Nolan provides a wonderful world that leaves you understanding to effect your enjoyment; although, simply enjoying it as a science fiction thriller/heist movie is sure to have your heart pounding. Watch this film, and decipher the ending as an interesting exercise rather than something to get worked up about. 10 thumbs up. And a half.",1
262," Not only was this movie worth the 15 dollars in IMAX, but it was worth the 2 1/2 hours at midnight. Christopher Nolan found a way to make this movie both inherently believable and suspenseful. The subtle humor was extremely tasteful, and Leo's acting was impeccable. On the note of acting, Ellen Page's performance was incredible and very worthy of Best Supporting Actress. The rest of the supporting cast made this movie so incredibly emotional and likable in so many ways, that this movie made me wish that fantasy dream science was possible. Well done.",1
263," The most entertaining movie I've seen in a long, long time. You walk away and you feel smarter, thinking about things you don't normally think about...taking those thoughts even deeper.",1
264, WOW! I've seen thousands upon thousands of movies in my life and no other has ever giving me that since of OMG WTF just happened? Your mind will start spinning. See it with a group of friends and just see what conversations come up in the car ride home. Besides being thoughtful it was also just great fun to watch it unfold. The action was top notch. The emotion was engaging. I could go into details on what I specifically liked or took from it but each viewer will take something different and that's what I feel is the point as well as the greatest accomplishment of this movie and should be something film makers strive to do. Well Nolen hit a grand slam with this one.,1
265, A wonderful fantasy blend of sci-fi and espionage. This movie will take your mind to amazing places and leave all sorts of ideas stuck in your mind.,1
266, Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece that is by far the best film of the year.,1
267,This is tha movie of the year man worthwhile and better than all summer releases.,1
268, Mind blowing & classic,1
269, Excellent movie.,1
270, Good just not brilliant. Maybe I've watched too much science fiction to be overawed with the concept. The plot seems quite simple in my ways but it's just repeated within its unnecessarily convoluted structure.,1
271," I though this film was extremely disappointing. First of all, you shouldn't have to see a movie multiple times to just get the point of it. I was bored with all the antics going on and finally just got tired of trying to put it all together. I looked at my watch many times to see how long I had sat there watching this. The hype for this movie is very misleading and though it appears many of the viewers who have expressed their feelings here thought it was a masterpiece, I am one of those who definitely does not feel this way. Nolan is a creative director, but this one isn't with his best. Of course, I did lose track after I had fallen asleep for the third time!",0
272," Watched he movie at the cinama last night, oh my god it was boring! All that stuff to make a dude destro his fathes empire, why dont blackmail him or something. Stupid story",0
273," I went into this movie with a rave recommendation from my sister. She loved it. I HATED IT. It was so contrived. I felt I was being forced to feel as if individual scenes were exciting (they weren't), that action was amazing (it wasn't). Perhaps it was the music...terrible. I hate movies where I can figure out what's coming next. And it didn't drive me to care about any of the characters. This is supposed to be challenging? It was LAME It was a waste of money. Wait for it to come out on DVD.",0
274, A whole lotta money spent on a whole lotta nonsense. not even half as good as the matrix and is twice as stupid.,0
275," Horrible movie. I've actually liked Nolan's previous work despite his allergy to coherent storytelling, but Inception is a miserable failure in every possible respect. It is not a complicated film; it is intentionally convoluted in the hope audience members will mistake this for depth. The overwrought music and sound effects are likewise intended to create the illusion of substance.",0
276," Very weak film, even dull. I felt no emotions when the credits came rolling. But the photography is beautiful and creative. Rent it.",0
277," People who give this movie a bad review because it doesn't make any sense probably just have ADHD. Yes, this movie is definitely a deep-thinking movie and you need to pay close attention or you might miss some things. But, that's one of the things that makes this such a good movie. The cast is great, the action and visuals are amazing, and the idea of being able to affect dreams is protrayed so well that it almost makes you believe that its possible. Christopher Nolan once again, hits it out of the park! Definite watch and Definite Buy.",1
278, Amazing movie highly recommended this film and its not a remake . I will see it again.,1
279,  Amazing movie! This movie blew my mind. Its been a long time before Ive been in a theatere that stood up and clapped at the end of a movie. This movie was incredible in every way. Might be my new favorite movie of all time.,1
280," Easily the most original of the year. Cinematically structured in a way I've never experienced before such as the use of nested narrative loops, the stretching and compression of time, the linking together of disparate spaces and yet surprisingly all of this reinforces a compelling and engaging story.",1
281, This movie baffled the mind and was created with perfection. I left the theater with a sense of awe and impossibility. Christopher Nolan has created the ultimate mind boggler of the century.,1
282," This entire film creeps and stalks on all fours. I've never been a full theater (at midnight no less) where you could literally feel that everyone was fully engaged in the tension. This film could've been a travesty, but it was brilliantly executed and acted. It asks a lot of its audience, but the ride is totally worth the mental bench press.",1
283, Inception is visually amazing and the cast is superb to say the least. The story is also extremely fascinating and is very memorable. Another must-see movie from the wonderful director Cristopher Nolan!,1
284," Really, really amazing. I sort of a mix between Memento and Brazil; totally worth it. An amazing, amazing movie.",1
285," What a waste of time and money. I never had the suspension of disbelief required to be part of or absorbed by a movie. The whole time I thought, ""what a load of crap"". It makes The Matrix look simple, linear and sane by comparison. Don't waste your time and money on this movie, even on DVD. I liked the Dark Knight and enjoy Leo iin most of his movies. Big flop.",0
286, An over-long mess of a film.,0
287," Embarrassing flick. Juvenile silliness geared to the tastes of the juvenile mind. Nolan some day may grow up, but it's doubtful. Such fluff, such gobbledy gook. In a just world, Nolan would never again be allowed to waste time, talent and money.",0
288, This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Leonardo Dicaprio is a terrible actor and in my opinion there are no redeeming qualities whatsoever. A boring mess.,0
289, I think this movie was Hollywood's attempt to see just how stupid the movie-going audience is.,0
290, Don´t get the hoopla. The story just wasn´t that interesting. It was tedios and confusing. When they all woke up in the plane and looked around as if to say ¨Why are we here¨ I felt the same way. Can´t recommend it.,0
291," Take the 2 hours and 48 minutes that you will waste on this film and help feed the homeless. This film is another useless film that people are told they are supposed to get excited about because it's 'smart."" Please, a violent bore of a film. Notice how all the people who gave it a 10 never explain why it's worthy of a ten.",0
292," This movie is truly great it kept me and my friends on the edge of our seats and we couldn't and still can't keep talking about how amazing it is like what happen with toy Story 3 @Will W how could you say this movie has no logic it is a SCI-FI movie, it is not based on anything it is using imagination something you obviously lack.",1
293," Mark my words: Inception is NOT a movie for the intellectually impaired, or the creatively deficient. You may notice that the nay-sayers of this movie all fall into one of these two categories; either too dimwitted to understand the movie, or too dull (and perhaps too conceited) to appreciate such a unique film. That said, you DON'T have to see Inception multiple times if you are A) reasonably intelligent, B) ready to watch a film intently from start to finish, and C) willing to suspend disbelief for a few hours, which is pretty much a requisite for 99% of movies anyway. If you successfully complete all three tasks, you will find Inception to be intriguing, suspenseful, and unlike anything you've seen before on a movie screen. To put it in one sentence... ""Inception is as simple as it is complicated.""",1
294," One of the best films I've seen for ages, great plot, great script, great cast and awesome effects. Top notch stuff.",1
295," Very sad ending, very epic characters, very amazing story. This movie is a must see!",1
296,"Let's hope Hollywood takes notice and realizes that there is more potential for success for a complicated movie done well vs. a ""comfort-food"" movie done poorly.",1
297,"Phenomenal film from top to bottom, one I'm sure will merit a perfect 10 on second viewing. Only a 9 at the moment due to the huge expectations and hype i placed on the movie which in fairness it just couldn't reach, I felt the length, and slight predictability took something away from it. But really that is not the point, this film can't be judged on the same merits as other big budget blockbusters because it is so darn original and clever. The ideas in this film would have been so extraordinary on paper and in Nolan's head but to apply them in such a stunning fashion and (more the most part just about) in a way that makes sense was at times draw dropping. The man knows how to build tension like no other major film director today,much like he did with the 'boat dilemma' in The Dark Knight he created another 'ticking clock' function which drove the film forward perfectly. The visuals in this picture are draw dropping and at no point look like a 'special effect', they are so natural in the film and make the dream sequences all the more immersive. One final note on Di Caprio, he just gets better and better and better, gives depth to the character that in turn increases the depth of the film, awesome!",1
298,"My favorite movie on first viewing since The Matrix. I love the ambition and the originality. As I walked out of the movie theater the first thing than came to mind was ""how the hell did he come up with that"".  If you haven't seen this movie you should go now.",1
299,"Inception managed to shatter every expectation that I had placed upon it. It is an exciting, challenging, wholly original film that is, at this point, the year's very best.",1
300,"Christopher Nolan has done it again. Dazzling, mindbending, and utterly exciting, ""Inception"" delivers in almost every conceivable way. I saw it twice during it's opening weekend, and I have every intention of seeing it again. Nolan's film blows every other Summer film out of the water. Hands down.",1
301,"What is a dream? Is a dream fragmented memories from your life that appear in a disjointed sequences of events or is a dream things you have done over the course of day or things you have seen that are lumped together to create a strange and at sometimes puzzling  world that springs forth from the inner most reassesses of the human mind. Some will tell you the answer to why we dream and others will say that we dream because it is how our minds are constructed to keep us active even when we sleep, (at least that is how I see it). The truth is that we as an advanced race will never truly know the reasons for dreams. The Human mind is the most complex and powerful thing we as humans posses and our ability to dream gives us something much more than just to keep our minds active it is a way for us to draw inspiration and to recover memories that we thought were long gone. Christopher Nolan(director of Memento, Batman Begins and  The Dark Knight) gives us a glimpse at the power of the mind the wonders of dream and a story that is as complex as the dream world it weaves a crime that does not take place someplace a place where the mind is the scene of the crime.   Over the course of 11 years, Christopher Nolan has become one of modern cinemas greatest directors delivering one amazing film after another after another after another, Nolan has achieved a certain level of success at such a young age that is only matched by one other legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Nolan's films are as complex as the next he never strays from focusing on the events of the story or the characters as they shift through theses dark and at sometimes lurid sequences of events that befall them. That is his style and that is the reasons I love his movies there is so much to them not just what is on the surfaces but what is beneath the surfaces the deep rooted anxiety of theses characters. There dark painful pasts, the non linear story telling that is almost ever present in all of his films   his latest endeavor, ""Inception"" is no exception. ""inception"" is a twist a minute, mind bending  brain teaser it is the rare kind of summer blockbuster that thrills you while at the same time making you think about the boundless possibilities that the dream world that our minds create. The only other movie, actually I should say movies, I have ever seen that posses such powerful questions  are ""The Matrix""(1999) and ""Vanilla Sky""(2001) although ""Vanilla Sky"" is far more like ""Inception than ""The Matrix"" they both are up there as two of the most mind bending Science Fiction films I have ever seen. Both films using the ideas of reality to further along there sometimes-confusing plot and ""Inception"" has one hell of a perplexing plot. This  kind of movie is a thinking persons movie someone who has the attention span to keep there focus  pinned on Nolan's bleak and stark vision of a dark visually stunning dream world that is amazingly not to different from our own. I know there will be people walking into this movie expecting a run of the mill action thriller that is just covered up by a premise that takes place in the dream world, they will sadly  walk out upset that they did not get the mindless action that they expected or even wanted. A more perceptive experienced moviegoer will know what to expect from this twisty Nolan film and if you know that, you can never predict how it will end or what will happen then you have all they need to watch this brilliant piece of filmmaking.   ""Inception""  took me by surprise I expected this film to be something similar to ""The Matrix""  and yet I  got something far more complex and daring  a wholly original and   jarring Sci-Fi Noir that boldly puts itself out there  and challenges the horrendous summer blockbusters by doing what they failed to do. Deliver a solid and thrilling piece of entertainment that surpasses anything that mainstream Hollywood has put out in the recent months. Nolan not only blows away the competition he crushes it leaving nothing but rubble of the films that should have been winner but instead were failures. ""Inception"" is one of the best if not the best film of the summer and one of the films of the year.",1
303,"This film blew my mind. I went to see it with a friend and both of us were speechless, in awe at the sheer brilliance of the film for 20 minutes afterwards. If you enjoyed The Dark Knight you will love this film. In fact, you'll probably love it even if you didn't.",1
304,"Utterly fantastic movie. Better than any of Nolan's former movies, best movie of the year (bar Toy Story 3). The effects are amazing, the cast is perfect, it's one of the most original things I've ever seen and it's just a perfect package. I loved it because it's not the average summer action movie - it actually makes you think for a change, unlike, say, Transformers or Star Trek.Go in expecting to think. If you go in expecting it to be another Dark Knight, you're not only stupid, you're expecting the wrong movie. Without trying to sound elitest, the only reason I can't see someone liking this movie is if they're either stupid, impatient or refuses to listen to something without explosions every five seconds. Those are good, but Inception isn't one of them. It's just clever action, and I can't think of anything else like it. 10/10, see it now.",1
305,"Inception, is an amazingly smart flick, that could have only been given from an outstanding director, and superior actors. they all come together to bring you a film that grabs hold of you and shakes you dry, and even when the movie finishes. you're left with a sense of confusion, and wonder.",1
306,"Although painstakingly constructed and well executed (like all Nolan's movies) - Inception is more fun to parse and think about than to actually watch. Not really very original if one is familiar with SF literature and films, but the ideas are carefully and tightly packed, the structure works on multiple levels, there are at least 2-3 possible interpretations of the events, the heist/bond movie structure and the this-worldliness of the dreamscapes is familiar enough as not to drive away the non-SF and non-surrealist crowds... It would really not be fair to ask for much more in a movie.",1
308,"wow, this movie was really good, i am serriously thinking about going to see it again, it left me with so many doubt about what went on and what didÂ´t happen, well thats how crasy the movie was. so go see it and be careful , u have to pay atention to all of the details.",1
309,"It's a fantastic film with a fantastic actor how leonardo dicaprio and with a fantastic director how cristhoper nolan.very very very advisable.In fact, i'm sure that this film comes to make a revolution in the oscars.....",1
310,"Overall this film has great emotional debt, a phenomenal cast, mind-bending action sequences, and one of the most original screenplays i have seen in recent years. However, it is not the greatest movie of our time, groundbreaking maybe, but not best. While Nolan's direction and screenplay are flawless, as are the effects and editing, it offers up too many similar characters and some implausible plot developments. The acting of some does redeem the characters being similar (those being Dicaprio, Cotillard, Page, and pleasant surprise Murphy) and the movie is saved with its head warping action sequences and the perfection of CHristopher Nolan.",1
311,"Great flick. Could be a perfect 10, but the story has a few holes that bothered me. Cast was great. Leo was Leo, always great, but sometimes i feel like I'm watching the same character in every movie he does.",1
312,Liked the concept and way the film developed. Although easy to work out in the end as to the overall finality of it all have to say I enjoyed it and will watch it again.,1
313,"I had high hopes for this movie, as I'm sure many others did. I loved Christopher Nolan's other work and was hoping this was as good as his other movies. I was very satisfied with the end result. This movie is very complex and hard to follow, so if you're looking for more of an action movie with a more simple plot, I wouldn't recommend this movie to you. But if you want a film that causes you to really think, than this movie is certainly for you. Nolan has really come up with an ingenious film concept and has thought through this plot. By the end of the movie, I was blown away. It was quite amazing.",1
314,"Nolan provides another lengthy look at his expertise yet again with Inception, two ingenious hours well built with substantial writing and solid performances, despite its innovative yet awfully bewildering premise.",1
315,Not as good as Matrix but very well done and well worth the time and money.  You definitely had to pay attention but that is part of its appeal--you had to think.,1
316,This is the kind of movie Iâ,1
317,"Excellent Experience almost perfect, one of the best movies I've seen in years. I canÂ´t wait for the Blu Ray. The Dream is Real",1
318,"Wow um, ok. One, or THE best movie i have ever seen. Love the music, never truly slow, had deep meaning, awesome acting, and plot that makes you feel proud to understand (which a majority do after a while) . Seeing it twice was also awesome because now you know what you are looking for and you also see more. I took my friend the second time and it was the 2nd best movie he has every seen..he watches a lot of movies. But ya, just open your mind and see it. Just dont get incepted.",1
319,"I would like to hint that this is an intellectual film, therefore it's going to lessen the 'popcorn experience'. Again, throughout the entire film you'll be working your mind to connect everything, and this might not be something you find entertaining. If you're still not sure whether or not to see it, I'll recommend you see it with a friend, or wait till it's on DVD, therefore you could watch it at your own pace.",1
320,"Best Leonardo DiCaprio Movie EVER! This is way better than Titanic, and The Aviator. The Plot makes sense, and Little CGI was used to make this movie.",1
321,"A must see, Inception is confusing at the beginning but it really captures you. I must say this is my favorite movie of all times. A marvelous film with good performances and a great director.",1
322,"Liked the progression of the story as well as the ""stacking"" of plot lies to create a long segment of action.  Very matrix-like but more clear and easier to understand.",1
323,"A mind-expanding film that will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the all-time greats. Incredible special effects, an ideal score from Hans Zimmer and, most pleasingly; outstanding performances from some of the finest actors of today.",1

The Dark Night was one his most critically acclaimed pieces, resulting in a huge boost to the saga but also raising the expectations of his future films. He now steps back into the limelight after two years to deliver his mind twisting thriller; Inception. Costing over $150 million to make, itâ",1
327,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. But not even loving it, not even seeing it twice in theaters, can I know who that man is near the end. I'll need to watch it a third time to find out, which will not be a chore, but a treat.",1
328,"A perfect film. Filled with nolan's original concepts and filmmaking mastery. I find the most amazing part of this film is his ability to convey thoroughly his dreamscape storyline. My only complaint was the excessive gunfighting, which spoiled the overall feel of the movie somewhat.",1
329,"THe hype was huge, the idea behind the movie was incredible, and it mostly lived up to both of those things. The movie is not perfect, and there will be detractors, but it is a unique movie that will make you think.",1
330,Inception is a rare blend of of both the visceral and the intellectual elements of film -a true cinema experience- My best since Fight Club.  I was really surprised I loved this movie as much as I did-since usually a highly hyped movie usually leaves disappointed - I'm looking at you Avatar.,1
331,"I'm a huge Chris Nolan fan, and Inception ranks as one of his best, if not the best. Highly original, a rarity these days, the story is dense but richly rewarding.",1
332,"Christopher Nolan has a catalogue of previous works that is undoubtedly envied by professional and amateur directors and writers alike, featuring the blistering talent of The Dark Knightand Memento amongst others. Does the hugely anticipated Inception live up to the standard set by Nolanâ",1
333,"With an original, mind-blowing and philosophical movie, Inception brings me the masterpiece I wish I had seen when I was born. It's the kind of movie most people needs to see at least twice to fully understand how the dreams really works. But already after the first time most people notice how deep the story really is. But of course, to fully understand the movie you must be concentrated for 150 minutes. En if you drop your concentration for a single minute, you won't understand a thing.If I could, I would've given it more than score 10.",1
334,"This movie is amazing.  Period.  Those who gave it negative reviews didn't understand it.  I guess they should waste their time reviewing other movies which they might try to comprehend with their pitiful, secluded minds while the rest of us enjoy one of the best movies on the planet.",1
335,"I love it! Is a movie that makes you think about a lot of things. Visually stunning, Superb soundtrack and exciting plot. After seeing the movie you get the feeling that you see everything in a different and exciting way.",1
336,"Anyone who didn't enjoy this movie should stick with Twilight, Clash of the Titans, Sex & The City 2 and other such Hollywood drivel. What or who were you expecting to see? I suspect if Cobb's character was called Jack, the dreams sequences were filmed on a sinking boat and the deceased heroine were Kate Winslet you'd all be wetting your pants with excitement.",1
337,"If Freud had written Bond this would have been the movie he made. Clearly a Nolan film because of the sheer balls this film has. Inception entertains and boggles all at once, not only because Nolan credits the audience with intelligence in presenting a complex narrative and concepts, but also because Nolan knows how to direct action bloody well. The ensemble cast work very well together, and a noteable performance from Tom Hardy was a delight to watch. A highly recommended film to see right now before you run the risk of any spoilers, and once youâ",1
338,"To affirm two streams of critique pervading this site:  (1) Inception makes very little, if any, sense; (2) Inception is awesome fun.  One way to reconcile these two, apparently conflicting notions is to restate the basic fact that inception is a movie--most notably a movie that takes place almost entirely in worlds of dreams.  Where Nolan (may) go astray is that he attempts to layer a system of logic and physical laws over the realms of imagination and subconscious; any such system is, of course, untenable (though quite fun--as Freud/Jung/etc. also prove).  At the same time, some such system is critical in order to create the game within which the movie plays.  So all along the way the viewer is confronted with massive offenses to her reason:  the main logic being that the imagination doesn't play by rules.  Bring on the insults--because their packaged inside one freakin' cool box.",1
339,"I must say I really didn't have a clue what to expect with this. I certainly like Nolan, but I feel I didn't get quite as caught up in the hype over some of his films as a lot of people did. However, I was blown away by this. I've seen it twice in the cinema and I'll most likely buy the DVD as well. Really exceptional performances across the board from a terrific cast, particularly Cotillard (who knew she could be so scary?) and the ever-excellent DiCaprio. I did feel that Ariadne was maybe slightly miscast, and as good as I think Ellen Page is, I felt her role could have been played by pretty much anyone. That's a minor niggle though, and probably a result of my not being able to find much else to constructively criticise. A marvellous thriller in every sense of the word - in scope, imagination and execution.",1
340,"A totally new, totally involving film, radical in its concept, perfect in its combination of live action and computer generation, and acted with authenticity and intensity.  Do not go to it tired, or expecting to sit back and relax as if it were some light musical -- or even an easily followed blockbuster such as Avatar.  Pay attention, get involved, the nuances from level to level are exquisite -- and take a few minutes after leaving the theater to re-enter reality.  I drove very carefully for the first five minutes going home from this.",1
341,This is a Amazing movie with so many good actors. I really liked this movie. It's seriously mind blowing. Christopher Nolan is really a true genius. I really hope that this movie will get nominated for best picture(which it probably will).,1
342,"I don't want to call Christopher Nolan a hack director, because by all rights, he isn't. But if he continues to receive these accolades so undeservedly, I might just have to in order to balance out the hyperbole. In truth, this movie was far from terrible, and on paper, much like Nolan's The Dark Knight, this film is my wet dream. As a fully realized epic depicting a futuristic world with equal parts sci fi, sophistication, dream science, and suave- all made possible by near-perfect special effects and amazing camera work- how could it go wrong? The story follows, primarily, Dom Cobb (DiCaprio), a mercenary agent of sorts working for various private companies to extract information from other company leaders' minds wile they sleep. Naturally, to give him a backstory, Cobb is also seeking redemption from the United States for some unknown reason, and has been forbidden to returning to his children due to exile. As the story progresses, Cobb is given the opportunity to get a clean slate, if only he can successfully build a team of people to go into the mind of the head of a major executive and plant an idea instead of extracting one- inception. Throw in an excellent cast of characters, how incredibly cool does this sound? How does any of it not hit home? And in fact, it doesn't really go wrong- perhaps by the sheer merit of the aforementioned ingredients and premise. However, three major, glaring problems hold this film back from realizing true greatness. It's risky for me to bring you, the reader, three levels into my psyche, but it's necessary. We need to go deeper. 1. Logistics and plot holes. On the first plane, we have the logistics of the movie. For all the praise this film is getting, you would think that this film was immune to pitfalls as basic as logical story arc progression. Unfortunately, it isn't. In fact, this film is simply riddled with myriad examples of nonsensical rules that are set up and broken all within the two hour run time. At the beginning of the movie, much like that little indy film The Matrix, rules are set up explaining how extraction/inception works, and how the dream world (parallel to the Matrix) operates. Well, that's great- that's just what you want. To establish rules for an alternate reality is necessary in a new film. The issue is that all throughout the movie, Nolan decided it would be great for characters to continually add new rules while simultaneously breaking the old rules. If you set rules, don't break them shortly thereafter. This breaks the trust of the audience, and the believability of the world you created. Without ruining anything, the second half of the movie is essentially a multilayered dream. In order to get out of each level, one must get a ""kick"" to move up until you reach complete consciousness- usually easiest to do this by getting killed or killing yourself. However, due to various extenuating circumstances, the multilayered dream won't allow for such an easy wake-up. Instead, dying brings you down lower in the dream state to a subconscious realm called Limbo. Way to switch up the rules. That would be fine I suppose except then, simply killing oneself or getting killed in Limbo kicks you all the way back into reality. Wait- so then what's the big deal about getting stuck in Limbo? This annoyance comes along with a slew of other made up plot devices which feel completely synthetic and appear to be used for sheer convenience. Shame on you, Mr. Nolan- leave that hack style for the bad directors. 2. Violation of accepted rules of dream science Okay, I'll keep this brief because I'm a nerd and most everyone else doesn't care about this. However, I say it is relevant because Nolan professes to love the idea of dreams and how they work. There is a field of study around dreaming, and more specifically, ""lucid dreaming""- wherein someone is dreaming but is conscious and acting with the knowledge that you are in a dream world. This has been well documented and there are official rules governing how a lucid dream works. Nolan is free to take liberties with dream sharing, something that is not real and is a great concept for him to invent and talk about. However, lucid dreaming is not science fiction- it's real. And in that dream science, the rules are as follows: A. To find out you are dreaming, check fine print on signs, books, etc. It will usually be nonsensical or a blur, because your mind won't fill in that level of detail. B. You may also check any digital clock to see if it is unreadable or rapidly changing, another indication you are dreaming. C. Flipping a light switch should do nothing in a dream- light levels are usually unchangeable in the dream state. The worst part is definitely that Nolan managed to follow rule C. throughout the dream sequencesâ",1
343,"Inception. One of the best films you will ever see. (probably the best). From writer/director Chris Nolan (who made the terrific Dark Knight) throws audiences into this world of awesome fight scenes, genuine emotion and white knuckle excitement. From Hans Zimmers beautiful score to the excellent performances by the cast (particularly Joseph Gordon-Levitt) quality shines out from everywhere. Its a film that does not degrade its audience. Its a film that assumes it's audiences intelligence; it has an amazing story, unlike most other blockbusters which just rely on visuals whilst disregarding the story (Avatar).In short; it's an action packed, tear jerking, exciting, funny, smart, adrenaline ride of a film, one that will forever be remembered as a modern classic. A masterclass in film making.You simply MUST see this film.",1
344,"This movie was THE BEST I've seen in the past few years.  I liked it way more than Avatar, better everything in my opinion.  The story was completely original, I've heard nothing of it before.  I will totally buy this movie once it releases on DVD and Blu-Ray.  You must go watch it, don't miss it in theaters.",1
345,The most entertaining movie I have seen in a long time.,1
346,GREAT GREAT SIMPLY OUTSTANDING.Although iam a big fan of Nolan movies i watched dark night some 30 times . But talking about this flick i think it was OUT OF THE BOX a great relief from those nonsense summer flick i think the problem came for the most of the people that watched this flick is that it took time to click or understand  the overall concept but i understood it very well it was a masterpiece. by the i should confess that the movie was very fast paced .Next time Nolan should take effort in explaining and making the plot simple. Doing this will go very well with casual moviegoers his movies will earn well.,1
347,"I don't agree with the people who totally slated this film and yet I'm not prepared to side with the people who attack anyone who thought this film was over hyped and offered very little. Personally, I think the film was quite good. However, in my opinion where this film failed was that it really didn't cause me to feel anything or to even question or think about any aspect of the film. Give me the Matrix, The Usual Suspects, The Sting or a good Alfred Hitchcock thriller any day. 7/10",1
348,"Since, The Dark Knight I was amazed by Christopher Nolan's work. Then some of the films of 2010 were either stupid or a waste. Then Inception came, and blew our minds with mindbending strategies that were absolutly amazing. THE PERFECT AND BEST FILM OF 2010! I say that is better than The Dark Knight. The story was great, the director did very well, the effects were amazing, and the film was just--Really, really amazing! 10/10!",1
349,"By far my favorite movie (so far) of 2010. Captivating in both it's creativity and complexity, Inception had me in constant deep thought. While making some key elements of the story a bit difficult to decipher (until later, when the pieces fall into place), the movie gave all intellectually inclined audience members their money's worth. Inception gets my vote for movie of the summer, and most likely movie of the year.",1
350,"A movie that tries to be serious, being extremely fantastic. Too many unanswered questions. Great special effects and camera work tough.Altough is a long movie, you don't get bored at all. Costant action and awesome scenes make this a very enjoyable movie.",1
351,"Inception is beyond good.  It's the most original, ambitious, and mind blowing movie you will ever see.  You will leave the theater in shock and awe picking up the pieces of your mind.  Aside from all that inception is perfectly acted and the cinematography is exceptional.  Truly one of the greatest movies to ever grace the big screen.  A must see!",1
352,"It's simple enough. Christopher Nolan's best film. Action sequences are brilliantly executed and imaginative, the cast is almost unbelievably strong helping to provide the unique depth which comes mainly from the writing. Plus you will be able to follow that story, as long as you don't have to leave at any stage.",1
353,Remarkable. This is the Christopher Nolan's masterpiece! Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard gave us strong performances. And the Oscar goes to...,1
354,"As with Memento (2001) and The Dark Knight (2008) before it, Chris Nolan continues to raise the bar with yet another complex, fascinating, thrill ride. Nolan takes the layers of complexity he established in his previous films and here takes them to an almost absurd level. Inception is a phenomenal achievement from beginning to end. The performances are all top-notch (led by master-of-the-furrowed-brow Leonardo DiCaprio), but its the story and visuals that really take the cake. Innovative and invigorating this is the best film of Summer 2010. Inception delivers.",1
355,"Nolan is brilliant as usual in this summer blockbuster, as is Leonardo DiCaprio. This is a cerebral movie with lots of twists and turns, and you have to keep up.  Will definitely buy on Blu-ray and watch several times to catch things I may have missed in the theater.",1
356,"Hands down one of the most creative and original movies of the year. Although the movie can seem a bit confusing at first because there are not many explanations at the beginning. However, the movie will make so much more sense if you go watch it more than once. It definitely helped for me, for I have seen it twice in theatres and I can`t wait for it to be released on DVD and Blu-Ray. Everything about the movie is just fantastic. The visuals, the story, the score, the acting, and the direction were all just simply astounding. This movie should be nominated for at least 10 Oscars. I`ve always been a fan of Christopher Nolan ever since Momento, and he continues to amaze me today with Inception.  Hollywood needs more filmmakers with the ambition and originality that Nolan has to offer. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to your next project.",1
357,"okay, i expected a lot of this movie. From the same director of Memento and The Dark Knight. Well I can say in my opinion. Best movie EVER !, The Godfather ? Nah its boring... Inception is the best !!",1
358,"A relateful film with all elements of it produced,barely to find anything to blame.Inception have all the thing great movie had but within a clear title to follow,which make all the thing not also.",1
359,"Inception was a very good movie. I believe the movie, while not anywhere near straight forward, was not entirely hard to follow. The movie seemed well written and i enjoy these types of movies. Memento was a great movie and i was not disappointed by Inception either. Even with the high expectation placed on it by my friends and reviews it lived up to the hype. Great movie and would recommend to anyone with an open mind.",1
360,"An outstanding, intelligent film designed to get your brain whirring. The characterization is superb, the acting is brilliant, and the plot will keep you on the edge of your seat til the end. I needed to go to the toilet from the halfway mark, but simply couldn't because the film just kept building the tension up to its stunning finale. Nolan's vision is clear from the get-go, with a twist around every corner. Absolutely epic.",1
361,"it looked cool. sounded cool. a movie about a team of people who rob information from a person's dreams. and the movie was cool. that sadi it was confusing and mind boggling, after a while i had no idea what was going on. i was so confused that im not even sure if i liked the movie",1
362,"This film defines everything that's right about a good film. I thought to myself that it could be slightly difficult to keep track of the plot if I wasn't with it from the beginning, and being awake sure paid off. Inception is exhilarating, epic, beautiful, brilliantly written and executed in a way that couldn't have been done better. If you haven't seen this film in a cinema yet, don't cease trying till you've done so. On a side note, this is the best film I have EVER seen. I was with it from the beginning, and I've never been rewarded in the ways Inception rewarded me before.",1
363,"Whoever doesn't give this movie a straight 10 just means that he didn't understand it. It is the type of movie in which you really have to concentrate to be fully aware of what is happening and which you got to see a second time to understand completely. The story is perfectly put together and it manages to throw you from one sensational idea to another. Adding to this, the actors do a wonderful job and  the effects make every scene breathtaking. It's a definite must-see.",1
364,"I really enjoyed this movie...I don't understand how people found it hard to follow, and that seems to be why it was given quite a lot of negative reviews.  It's a good film with a great cast to back it.",1
365,"Absolutely loved it, the intricacy with which it was put together, and how ambiguous the ending was kept my brain permanently ticking over. And instead of being boring on the thrills front like many thinking man's films are, the slow-mo sequences and stunts were breathtaking and fun to watch. As for character development and the like, I suppose many have argued this is lacklustre, but without knowing exactly what each person's role is within the film due to ambiguous plot means it's a terribly difficult one to approach. Personally, I felt that I knew who each character was, and Page and DiCaprio who were really the main characters, put in good, deep performances. Past that, I feel I don't have any problems with how the characters were portrayed and thus I'm not going to 'mark the film down'. I am bound to watch the film again at some point in the near future, in which case my views may change slightly, but for now this film wowed me from start to finish, almost completely made logical sense to me (mixed with suspension of disbelief needed for the whole Inception concept), and has kept me thinking about it for days after. If that's not a damn good film, I don't know what is.",1
366,Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Indeed it is complex but Christopher Nolan makes it both enjoyable and understandable. This is by far the best film i have seen this year and a major contender at the oscars.,1
367,"This film is so overhyped! It is boring action and an even more boring storyline, with even more boring atmosphere. This Film was literally putting people to sleep. I forced myself to stay awake because i was waiting for the plot to turn interesting, but no. The film finsihed and it was hard to make it all the way through. BORING! BORING! BORING!",0

A unique plot line that increasingly, as the movie progresses, gets you to question from what layer of reality events are occurring.  While there are some plausibility issues at a technical level, they are far outweighed by the underlying questions that the movie forces you to grapple with.  You will not be disappointed.",1
371,"Inception was a thinking mans movie, much like the people who really question the world of dreams. Its starts off and ends kinda confusing, but after a second viewing, the plot is complex, but well thought-out. I enjoyed a summer movie with great special effects and a deep personal story, hard to come by these days and i'm glad it didn't get suckered in to 3-d. I also thought the camera, sound and music  work was unbelievable. At times you mind find it slow, (how long did it take for the van to fall into the river?), and some simply wont get it. but in the end, this summer tale of dreams and regret will leave you breathless",1

373,"It was alright, a little hard to follow at times, but not too complicated. I would have appreciated a little more expository narrative instead of just taking the main character's word for it, like ""this is how it is"" ""...okay"". It was very pleasing visually and I was surprised to see as much action in it as there was, though there were quite a few instances that seemed to just drag on throughout the movie, even some of the action scenes seemed to drag on. All-in-all, an alright movie, though not one I would care to see again and I don't really feel I would have missed anything if I had never seen it at all.",1
374,"I don't know how all you ""smart people"" are have trouble understanding this damn movie. And don't go listing how your a particle physicist or other rubbish, trying to show how smart you are. If you don't follow this movie you won't get it. If you aren't willing to go see a movie with an open mind you won't get it. If you can't watch a movie and accept the rules in place set by that film and think in your dreams there are no rules, you won't get it. With this in mind if you are willing to accept all the above, then prepare for the most thought out physiological movie of the year. The ""layering"" of the storyline is perfect with each dream. If you don't follow these rules just rate it a zero (Which is ridiculous.) write no positive points and how the expendables was heaps better. Even though your an idiot because they are two completely category films. If you don't like the film you should at least admit it had original ideas, or you could continue to throw feces on you wall whilst making monkey noises.",1
375,Let me just say that this is a movie that requires you to expand your mind and understand that it is simply a movie; not a documentary.  Truly enjoyed the premise of entering others dream world.  Great and original!!,1
376,"An abstract and totally conceptual film. You cannot miss the opportunity to mesmerize yourself in movies like these -even though inception may leave your brain numb if you pay attention to every detail and every moment- but it's worth it, and will leave you overwhelmed at the sheer quality and beauty of the plot, action and dialogue.",1
377,"I was disappointed in this movie.  Especially, after all the hoopla.  The concept of the film was clever, but the way the director chose to tell the story was dull and unoriginal.  The use of the video game shoot 'em ups were disappointing and not at all dreamlike.  It was pretty much the same old rehashed stuff we've been subjected to watch for the last thirty years.  The idea that someone would experience real life automatic weapons  down to the last spec and detail in a dream is laughable.  Anybody that dreams, and that's just about everyone, knows it doesn't happen that way.   There were a few good and believable dreamlike scenes, like the city and the folding streets, and Nolan can thank M.C. Escher for his strongest statements into the dream world, but for the most part, the director lost a great opportunity to tell a unique story about the profound power and importance of dreams in our lives, and instead decided to make it into just another run-of-the-mill action thriller with a sci-fi tease.",1
378,"Inception"" is an engrossing and enthralling thriller. This is the kind of film that requires multiple viewings, not just because it creates an entire dream world but because it offers deeper exploration into the mind, a place only Nolan can take you.",1
379,"This does go into the weeds - past the point of belief.But, like any GOOD movie, it makes you SUSPEND that belief.I did not find this to be anything PROFOUND (yeah, I capitalize my points), but a good movie it is.Excellent acting all around - no complaints. It's well-presented, and although it is actually quite a VERY long film (2h20something if memory serves), you never notice.. Probably the best compliment I can pay.At the end, some people think it's oh so mystical, etc. No - it isn't that. But what it is is an EXCELLENT combination of period-piece filmmaking, music and casting. (note I didn't say PLOT) They don't distinguish a timeline with respect to the styles they portray, which I thought was awesome. It could have been 70 years ago or today. Nice touch, I thought. Casting was immaculate all the way around. Probably by accident, but no matter.It is true that the IMAX version is BEST. I live in NC but I was out in CA on business and saw it in an IMAX in Santa Clara which was very well done (the sound, in particular, was really well-done).In my opinion, it's not ""earth-shattering,"" but it's a very fine movie nonetheless. I highly recommend it.Just know what you're looking at, OK? ;)",1
380,"Fabricating dreams and threading them together to make a cohesive multi-layered blanket is a daunting task that's awfully difficult to weave. However, Christopher Nolan pieces together a marvelous endeavor deep into lucid dreams within dreams with Inception. The dazzling summer blockbuster is a fascinating heist film with rich visual effects and a vastly engaging plot that passes quicker than the elapsed time would indicate. This is convenient, though, because this pic undoubtedly requires more than just one viewing to fully embrace. Enter Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), an extractor who enters dreams of others in order to get otherwise unobtainable information. Along with a team consisting of point man Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), architects Nash (Lukas Haas) and Ariadne (Ellen Page), and forger Eames (Tom Hardy), Cobb is auditioned to commit the perfect crime for business tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe). In order to alter the fate of Saito's business, Cobb is instructed to plant an idea in the mind of corporate rival Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) that will persuade him into dismantling his father's business. Along the way, Cobb frequently encounters the adequately named Mal (Marion Cotillard), his deceased wife that has an unrelenting determination to keep him in the dream limbo. Her intense desire serves as the most significant emotional conflict, steering Inception away from being a superficial heist film. However, this doesn't cement Inception as a deep journey into character. Nolan meanders into the life of Cobb and his strained relationship with his family. This strain Cobb blames himself for, but the reason for the blame eventually develops as the film progresses. The backdrop of the rest of the characters is vague, not offering much substance to the characters. Some hints lie within Fischer's character, including a cryptic artifact that paints significant dimension, though it's subtle enough to go unnoticed. Additionally, Ariadne shovels out plenty exposition, but it is forgiveable given the already convoluted plotline and potential time constraints. Perhaps a film with this kind of magnitude needs some sort of explanation--it's not so much of a force feed, and the exposition doesn't hinder the pace. It's just there and it might be a bit much for those who vehemently oppose it, but keep in mind that without it, there's a good chance that it would make the film much more difficult to follow.Inception is an intricate dive into the deepest state of mind that threads a remarkable sense of surreality. Don't ignore this film. See it more than once. Disregard the critics' opinions until you make your own, though a first impression will not be sufficient. This is the Hollywood summer blockbuster of your dreams.",1
381,"So, are people reviewing ""The Matrix"" or Inception?"" I'm confused.  I treat going to a movie like I treat the day when I awake...if I get too excited or have high expectations or preconceived notions, I set myself up for possible disappointment. We just bought our tickets, put our butts in the seats, and let it play. I found Inception a thrill ride, and much better than the blockbuster drivel that passes for entertainment these days. If you want human interaction that builds drama, this isn't the movie for you. If you want a no holds barred action flick that is highly inventive, breathtaking, and challenges you to pay attention in our world of texters and multi-taskers; put your money down and enjoy Inception.",1
382,"Two words to describe this movie: Mind F**k. The best movie of the summer, the best movie of the year, the best movie i have seen in a while. Not since The Matrix, have i been so excited about a movie.",1
383,"This movie is fantastic. It's amusing to see how many of the negative reviews complain about confusing plots, too little action, too much action, or... amazingly... all three. For me, this movie stands out as one that makes you think; not necessarily in order to unravel the plot, which (despite some complaints) is simple enough, but about reality versus perception. The score, acting, and story were all fantastic, but for me what makes this film special is that I'm still thinking about it. Also... Ken Watanabe is the man.",1
384,"I watched Inception and it was the most intelligent movie I've ever seen. It's not a movie that had to be plotted from the beginning, it started with an idea (ironically) and it bloomed into a story; middle to end, because there was no beginning, the beginning was the end and how it started.Anyone who can say this movie is bad is probably someone who doesn't appreciate true quality.  Inception was great because the movie was great; the idea was great, and didn't need to be covered up by sex and gun fights. Anyone who say they didn't like it, don't flame the movie, either you didn't pay attention or it's just not right for you.",1
386,Excellent film. A fascinating take on merging fact and fiction of dreams and the human mind. Nolan once again has a great story influenced by human nature.,1
389,"this is the best movie i've ever seen, and in my opinion the best movie ever made. the acting is great, the story intriguing and engrossing and the effects dazzling. this is the movie to go see this year, if not this lifetime.",1
390,"A really entertaining and original movie.  Likely the best of the summer movie season of 2010 - i.e. better than Iron Man 2 and just a hair above Toy Story 3.   Leonardo fits the movie and simply knows how to pick scripts and directors.  When was the last time that Leonardo was in a bad picture?  I am not even a big Leonardo fan, but he knows how to pick his projects.Well worth the ticket price.  I will be buying this on DVD.",1
391,"Not the most epic, but good. Good performance by DiCaprio, an averege really acting. I still with Shutter Island the most cultic movie of 2010. Very classic modern story but very very fantasy by Nolan brithers. I think after The dark Knight , Nolan be going a little bit slow now, I very expect that next Batman of Nolan in 2012 will be the best ever of Batman, I think he must cast to the film Johnny Depp for Lead Villian in the Movie and stay with Gary Oldham with the dirtty police-man after all",1
392,Easily one of the best movies ever made!!! Nolans vision is original and his mind is truly spectacular!!! The actors could not have been chosen better and the effects were just perfection!!!,1
393,It was a ridiculously entertaining film with amazing visuals and memorable action scenes. Although confusing and too specific at times it will keep you at the edge of your seats.,1
394,"The trailer for the film was fantastic, and the fact that Chris Nolan directed it reeled me in.  I couldn't wait to see it.  When I saw it, I liked it but didn't love it like so many others.  I tend to see things black or white, so the story that so many people have blogged and argued and were confused about seemed pretty straight forward to me.  In fact, the characters explain what is going to happen when they are inside a dream, then when they dream it does happen.  Another problem I had with the film is that I didn't care about any of the characters, so I didn't care if they died or not.  A better film than this one in the same genre would be ""Dark City"".  That one blew my mind AND I cared about the characters.  I also thought the loud soundtrack sometimes muted the dialogue.  Overall a good film with great special effects that might get better for me with repeated viewings.",1
395,"Inception is the latest film from Writer/Director, Christopher Nolan. The same guy who brought the world Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia, The prestige, and, most importantly, The Dark Knight. Seeing as how The Dark Knight is one of my favorite films of all-time, I didn't think Nolan could out due this masterpiece. So, when I first heard of Inception, I didn't expect it to live up to The Dark Knight. I was wrong. Inception is as good, if not better than The Dark Knight.I have no idea how to even begin speaking of how great this film this is. The cast is amazing, especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives the performance of his life. The look is unlike any other movie ever. The changing environments, the amount of layers, and the scope are unreal. everything about this movie is just perfect.I'll begin with the cast. The Film is power packed with loads of great actors and actresses. I already spoke about Leo and I'll come back to him. Tom Hardy from Band of Brothers plays a shape-shifting Eames. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, an extractor. Ellen Page, who played Juno in, well, Juno, plays Ariadne and architect. Cillian Murphy, Who played a chilling scarecrow, plays Robert Fischer, the future leader of a billion dollar energy company. Dileep Rao plays a medicine man who produces the team with drugs to enter deep sleeps. Ken Watanabe is the man who funds the entire project. Marion Cotillard plays Mal, Cobb's former Wife. And good 'ole Leonardo plays Cobb and extractor tasked with implanting the idea of breaking apart a huge energy company soon to be run by Robert Fischer. He puts together an elite team of 5(6 since the funder comes along) to do this near impossible mission of inception.The look is amazing. The constantly changing scenes, especially towards the end, make an amazing feat of editing glory. The movie was filmed in 6 different countries going from a small hotel room to a snowy landscape in seconds. The idea of layers also plays deeply in the movie. Its hard to explain without spoiling the movie, but its a key concept that lasts through out the entire film.I already spoke of the acting, but, god, I was blown away. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an amazing performance as a man who had everything and then lost it. the amount of emotion and conveying is so intense that I have already nominated and given him the academy award for best acting ever. the rest of the cast does well too, but Marion does a great job as well. I wouldn't be surprised if she was nominated for best supporting actress.The Story is of course the best part. This is an ever going film. You can't look away for a moment. The dialogue is some of the best I've ever heard. Lines that not only develop the story, but show off Nolan's ability to make characters likable even with many flaws. The story follows these characters through many environments, of course, but the pace of the movie is just unreal. It isn't fast, but it isn't slow. Its not really in the middle either. Its literally impossible to describe.The movie opens with Cobb already in a dream, trying to perform an extraction. The dream, however, is a test to see if Cobb can preform the art of inception. Initially, he refuses, but after being offered a cleared name and his family back, he agrees, saying, ""I can do the inception. I've done it before."" Cobb puts together a team of people to build the dreams and help add an idea to Fischer's mind. The only problem is, they can't give him the idea in a single dream. He would reject the idea. they have to trick him into believing that he actually came up with the idea. The devise a plan to go through 3 levels of dreams. I wouldn't spoil it for you, but the entire latter half of the film is shear amazement. And for all of you who think all movies have predictable endings, be warned. Inception has the greatest ending ever. Out of all the stories I've ever heard, watched, read, or even played, none compare to this one.The idea of the movie is amazing and very original. I heard a lot of people say that they were comparing the film to The Matrix, another very original film. I can't think of any other film that has used the idea of entering dreams. It sounds more like a crazy religion that a movie, but Nolan does it and he does it well.I can't get over how great this film is. If you haven't seen it, go right now and watch Inception. Its the best and most original film that you'll see this year and maybe even this decade. Inception will be remembered by many things. I will remember it as one simple thing, perfection. 5/5",1
396,"I found this movie to be entertaining and epic. It's plot was great and was something you really needed to pay attention to. The acting was great and all of the actors need to be applauded for their efforts. All in all, an epic look, great story, and great acting gives you Inception!",1
397,"Inception is One GREAT sci-fi psychological thrillers.One of THE best in the genre.Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece with perfect direction,phenomenal acting,great script,mind bending scenes and an action packed story being the key ingredients, making it a must-see movie...!",1
398,"I have learned that when I was young, I would always wake up before hitting the ground during a free fall. (Always from a cliff of some sort.) However, nowadays when I find myself in that precarious position in a dream I become aware that I am in a dream and I just transport or change positions without concern.  Nolan has managed to take this interesting topic of dream state and make a wholly original film exploring what is ""real.""  In addition to the originality, the cast and editing are top-notch.  The way the movie was edited and directed adds to the ambiguity by never really having a starting point.  i.e. ""How did you get here?""  Nolan definitely expects us to keep up with him.  He rarely dumbs down the dialogue reiterating things we already know.  After all, I am now grown and know it is all just a dream.......",1
399,"I don't know what to say. Inception is a movie that changes film-making into an art form. Every aspect of it I loved; the mind-blowing plot, the stunning special effects, the amazing acting and every part of the film fit to be judged. For some the plot may seem confusing but I loved it in every way. It has been artfully created so that it reveals key pieces of information at precisely the right time. The performances of every one of the actors were spectacular, each demonstrating their true talents and showing what real acting is all about. The emotion and realism conveyed through the script, acting and the movie itself was astonishing. But pure originality, the one thing that every film should be judged upon, shines through Inception from start to finish. Inception is tribute to the very first of the filming world and a sign that more like it are soon to come. This is by far the best film I have ever seen and I highly recommend it.",1
400,"I loved the ending. It may mean he is still in a dream, or not in one. The plot was pretty confusing, but I understood most of it. Excellent movie. Big recommend.",1
401,"Inception has most of the usual suspects of a summer movie: awesome action, cool characters, and shooting. However, Inception is much much more than a blockbuster. The film is brainy, complex, and emotional. The script is one of the best I have seen, with top notch ending that will leave your jaw on the floor, Inception is film perfection. Do not miss this movie, absolutely go out and see it!",1
405,"Clever and entertaining mix of sci fi and thriller with plenty for fans of both genres. If anything the side plot of the main character, while giving him some depth, distracts from the main focus of the movie. Well worth watching and and nice to see an original concept although the fight scenes are not up to the standard of the Matrix.",1
406,"Best movie Ever! It has great actors, one of the best producers ever, a really great story, great actors, great plot, great action, it has great everything",1
407,"This film didn't quite know what it wanted to be. It was overly ambitious with little insight into realism when it was inviting audiences to take it seriously. A good cast wasn't enough to do it for me, as the slow and rather tedious story progression was too distracting. Towards the end I was quite restless as it was needlessly dragging on whilst becoming a bit of an action film where it wasn't necessarily due. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and I thoroughly enjoy the majority of his films except this one. Hopefully it was a one off.",0
408,"In any medium of art, there is a balance between the abstract and concrete. The issue that arises in Inception is that the director, Nolan, delves too much into the abstract that any meaning becomes so purposefully ambiguous so as any logical explanation is irrelevant due due to the fact that so many are possible. Even though this can be seen as a pro or a con, pretentious psuedointellectuals will love this film, basking in its non-revelatory metaphysical overtones. Also, the action sequences are more than likely going to feel drawn out (Nolan could have at least made the unveiling towards the climax 1/3 of how it was) - the reason that it was done the way it was is in due probably cause to the fact that Nolan wanted to make an epic film. Though there is something that this movie is and the best word I can use is that of a concept coined by the author Kurt Vonnegut: ""Cranfalloon."" A Cranfalloon is something that seems epic, bold, audacious or significant and yet, like a balloon, is filled solely with air. It's as if this film ""Inception"" should have really been called ""Deception,"" as in; we are deceived to believe that this jumble mess of ideas in which the number of possibilities for interpretations causes a negation of any one ""true"" interpretation. I don't regret watching it. The second time I watched it, though, I strongly desired having spent that time doing something else.",0
410,"This is the best movie of all time! It just gets everything right. It is beautifully plotted, masterfully acted, and the visual effects are absolutely incredible! It is so much more smarter than your typical action film and it does not rely on its action and visual effects (which in this film was amazing by the way) but its storyline is strong enough to keep you engaged. Chris Nolan, you are a legend!",1
411,"I just watched this movie for the second time, and wow my opinion has completely changed. At first I got bored with the second half of the movie, possibly because of the way it goes from laying down and explaining all the dream rules into a much more fast paced action film. But after watching again I can appreciate it so much better, this movie really immersed me. I dont have too many complaints with the direction either. Thought it was a bit lame with the staircase drop and some other minor things, like goons who cant aim at all! But overall theres a lot of food for thought and it really keeps you on the edge.",1
412,"You have got to love the originality of Inception, the mind-blowing visuals and the intriguing storyline. Very few movies can put that itch in your brain, that itch that makes you need to understand what's going on, that itch that makes you forget about your popcorn and soda or who and what is around you. It's that good feeling you get after watching a Christopher Nolan movie. He doesn't treat the audience to dumb-downed plots and dialogue and inexplicably intense and useless action scenes, yet he maintains that simplicity that lets his movies, Inception in this case, a movie that leaves all ages in awe and wonder.",1
413,"If you read a psychoanalysis book by Sigmund Freud, you will find that the concept of this movie is complex itself, but the characters and development and the final of the story is just non sense but it tries to make you thing that you are watching a very confused and complex story, but think about it, the final is a confused open final, why? because it simply has no end just because Christopher Nolan don't know how to tell a story",1
414,"Christopher Nolan shot to fame a decade ago with a low-budget masterpiece called Memento ... the same year that an over-hyped Peal Harbor flopped. Inception is the ""Pearl Harbor"" of the following decade ... an expensive failure. The most amazing thing about this one was how the promoters managed to bribe every major critic on the planet - at the time I did not read one bad review & I was therefore conned into rushing out to see it. This is proof-positive that the critics are paid off by big interests. Ironically, my girlfriend fell asleep during the movie! Even my son agrees with me. This one is a complete abomination.",0
415,"It's easy to get lost in a feature like Inception.No, not because of its apparently complex storyline and premise, which I find rather simple to follow, as it is clearly explained throughout the film. Rather more its gripping tale of taking a simple idea in our mind, and create pretty much whatever we see fit.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as 'dream thief' Dom Cobb, an expert in extracting information from a subjects subconscious. To return to a life of peace with his children, Cobb is asked to commit 'Inception', planting an idea inside a subjects subconscious while they are asleep.Christopher Nolan has created not necessarily something to baffle and dumbfound the audience, but a big-budget look at what we can create using something that will never go away...an idea.Cobb, with the aid of his associate Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) pull together a team to help infiltrate the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy). The team consists of Ellen Page as the architect (creating the dream world) Ariadne, expert forger Eames (Tom Hardy) and Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe), the business man trying to remove the competition of dissolving Fischer's fathers corporation, through Inception. While stunning visuals, epic set pieces and superb storytelling are all a-plenty, its the source which created these excellent moments that is the most wonderous part of the film, the unique, mind-provoking, yet simplistic plot of dreaming. It's all a wonderfully scripted puzzle which we, the viewer, must piece together, make us think and question what we believe to be real.It's also the way in which its portrayed onscreen that they are trying to tell as if we should already know that this is all possible, they don't overkill the idea, they simply remind us that it could be a dream.Christopher Nolan doesn't try to simplify his film at all, he merely wants the viewer to grasp its concept and think what they will for themselves.DiCaprio puts in a stellar performance as Cobb, he brings the sense that his character has been there too long at what he does and portrays this through his avoidance at direct open ended conversations with Ariadne, who suspects the whole operation could be blown due to Cobb's unwillingness to let go of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard).Spectacular set-pieces set up a thrilling finale to this outstanding tale, and what culminates in the story will be seen as a cliff hangar to some, but a sense of closure brought about by excellent storytelling and convincing performances from the ensemble cast , Inception definitely asks the viewer to think about it for a while, and even then you still might not be able to explain what exactly you seen, but that it definitely needs to be planted in your subconscious.",1
417,"I guess this movie works. There's good action scenes and some interesting camera use, but it's ultimately ruined by Christopher Nolan's pretensions. I found myself annoyed by its attempts to be deep, with cheap tricks like the top at the end presented as some mind-bending ambiguity. Its resemblance to Shutter Island is also worth noting, with DiCaprio playing Cobb as a Federal Marshall minus the accent. I was just really disappointed that this movie could have been better, had the dream nonsense either been removed or executed better.",0
418,Inception to put it simply is a masterpiece. the most intelligent movies in years. it is not your typical summmer movie with its stupid storytelling and clumsy actions scenes. Mr. Nolan has not failed on a film yet and this will continue the streak. The best film of the year.,1
419,"An intellectually charged blockbuster that boggles and penetrates the mind at every level, 'Inception' is the epitome of brilliant, modern filmmaking. Christopher Nolan's genius bursts through the seams of this intricately constructed mythology presented in a maze of emotional depth, plot sophistication, heart-throbbing action and a score that immerses you in this world. Strikingly thought-provoking and original, Inception is not only the finest film of the year, but one of the finest films ever crafted.BRAAAM BRAAAM, indeed.",1
420,"Inception is complex and requires a lot of brain power and attention to keep up with, and I love it. Just listening to the characters talk about how dreams work had me interested. Then you get to see the dream sequences and they're incredible. The premise of this film is just genius and it's really well plotted and structured, as well as being thrilling and occasionally exciting. It's definitely one of the smartest blockbusters of the decade so far.",1
421,"Inception is one of the best films of the year. It refuses to adapt to our world, but instead sucks us into it's universe. Everything is spectacular about this movie. Bravo.",1
422,"A slow start, which becomes understandable on second and subsequent viewings, with a brilliant finish.  This is a highly original film and the effects are outstanding.  The pace is perfect given that there are several streams racing towards the ending.  Apart from the overall concept, which is brilliant, the soundtrack of Inception is absolutely first rate - in the final scenes of the film I was on the edge of my seat - this is rare in movies these days.  The emotional elements were exactly right and the music helped to deliver a magical movie experience.",1
423,"Fascinating! I did not know what to expect the first time I saw it. I was blown away. The first minutes seem so complicated that it´s a miracle you keep discovering and discovering things. The visuals, the cast and the idea are amazing. Minutes fly and without noticing it you are so invested. And not only because of the action and the amazing pace, the movie has soul and in the final minutes it really takes your heart too. Marion Cotillard: damn she´s only in a few minutes and her performance and character are so important. It´s breathtaking, innovative and entertaining. It also makes you think and stays on your mind for days. One can´t ask for more. One more thing that is essential: the score. It´s so breathtaking it stays on your mind. One of my favorite scores of all times. The film is almost perfect. Only few people giving it low ratings are the ones so accustomed to mediocre action films that they went to see this thinking it was about brainless action and their brains could not handle it. Incredible film. One of those you can see again and again.",1
424,Awesome plot! Just a wonderful idea. There are very few movies that bring something new nowadays - this is one of them. I have never seen anything similar. Great play from Di Caprio.,1
425,"Yes, I said masterpiece. This is going to be difficult, since saying too much here is surely damaging to the movie going experience. This film has been criticized as much as it has been praised, and all for the same thing, the depth of the script. Yes, this film can be hard to grasp IF you aren't paying attention, but it really isn't too complicated to follow if you walk in with the right mindset. My brother hated this film, but he went with a bunch of reckless teenagers who talked throughout the whole movie. This isn't your typical action film; you have to actually `watch' this one. I went with my wife. We LOVED it. Simply put, `Inception' is about a man named Cobb who, due to his profession, has been separated from the ones he loves. His wife is dead and he has been charged with her murder. If he returns to the states, he will be incarcerated. So, for the time being, he is not able to see his children. What it is that Cobb does is someone complicated. He uses dreams to steal valuable ideas from influential people. Using technology suited for this task, he enters the mind of the sleeping, builds dreamscapes inside their minds and creates an alternate reality that allows him to extract whatever it is he is paid to find. It's not as hard to follow as it sounds. At the films outset we are shown just how this works. After a botched job, Cobb and his partner Arthur are given a proposition; to perform inception. With this job would come the ability to return home and see his children. There is a small problem though. Inception is much different and much more complicated a procedure because it involves implanting an idea, not stealing one. This is harder because it is a much deeper deception; for in order for the idea to take root and grow, Cobb and his team have to make it feel as though the `victim' has come up with this idea all on his own. It has to feel real. Christopher Nolan has a huge following, especially after his brilliant `The Dark Knight', which garnered lots of praise, attention and even an Oscar or two. While that film continues to grow on me in ways unprecedented (not really, but you get the picture...it is brilliant), there is no denying that Nolan continues to show the goods. `Inception' is so smart it's scary. Nolan understands that society in general gravitates towards the action film. It is the big Hollywood summer blockbuster. It is a way to make a lot of money. BUT, Nolan also understands that big explosions and million-dollar effects cannot take the place of a smart and involved script. He has continued to build a name for himself by marrying the two components beautifully, and `Inception' is no exception. The film is complex yet free-flowing. The pacing is exceptional. The dramatic overtones are all there in spades, especially since the main characters are fleshed out and given life (Cobb becomes three dimensional, and his back-story is just as entrancing as the films actual plot without ever taking away from it). Some have mentioned that the acting is standard fare, and then some have raved Leonardo DiCaprio and claimed this the best performance of his career. I don't agree with either statement (best of his career...really?) but I came very close to writing this review as a `best in show' piece and somewhat Oscar FYC for Marion Cotillard, who is just plain OUTSTANDING in this film. Anyways, I decided not to (but a surprise Oscar nomination for her would be AMAZING and totally deserved). That said, this film is very, very good. I fully expect it to snag a slew of Oscar nominations (including Best Picture and Best Director) and it will be deserved. No, this film is not the best film ever made (come on fanboys, you are giving the film itself a bad name) but it is a truly impressive feat for the genre and it further cements Nolan's name as one of the most impressive and imaginative directors of his generation.",1
426,"Wow. Inception. Enough bends and turns and twists to really make your vision funny. But, all in all, this is the best movie I have seen. Ever.The main plot of the film was simple, but when you throw in all the 'other' bits it becomes something a little more... interesting. In a good way.Christopher Nolan looked at his other movie 'memento' and just went 'You know what. People liked that. Lets do something similar, but not as backwards (literally) as the previous movie!' (don't get me wrong, that was great to).Inception takes everything you know about film and he makes it do a full headstand. He gets some of the most proclaimed actors and offers them to do something they really haven't done before. Like walk up a road vertically, or fall into the water slowly, but in real time (if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I mean), and many other amazing things.Yes, the plot is somewhat confusing, but it doesn't not say that it isn't amazing. The twisting plot, the special effects and everything in between.I have seen it countless times, and it has not changed my viewing experience. I am still amazing four years on at what it has achieved. Christopher Nolan is probably the greatest director at the moment. Not only because of his countless, infinite ideas. But because of the time and effort he has probably put into this movie. If you have not seen it, then have you been living under a rock? The questions simple. If you haven't, go onto Amazon and get it (probably) quite cheap (unless your wanting it in blu-ray. I'm not stopping you buying it in blu-ray, however).This is certainly, the greatest film of all time, in my opinion. You may have yours, but I have mine.",1
427,"it it amazing move i have't seen before and till.after watching movie iknow that director is genius and expecially about O.S.T  is very fantastic.i love music director hans zimmer too. when i know based music of movie reflect flow of time.i'm so scary and incredible. it is best movie in my life .",1
428,"Inception is a fantastic combination of exciting action, great intrigue, fantastic suspense, a fascinating plot, and its magnificent premise about dreams. It's excellent from start to finish.",1
429,"Easily dominating best movie lists of 2010, and welly deserved as the best film I have seen so far this decade. Christopher Nolan has lived up to his reputation as a daring director by making one of the ambitious cinematic wonders like the Wizard of Oz meeting the Matrix and turn it into the number one fantasy heist film that was believed to be impossible to film. Amazingly photographed, visually edited, and lots of shocking never before seen special effects and an all star cast executing great performances, as well as careful directing, its a mind-blowing science venture of epic proportions that  makes it a phenomenon of the ages. a new technological monument that gives us a trip from reality into the suspenses of our dream world where your mind is the weapon for the perfect crime. its an easy A+ epic not to be missed",1
430," Wildly creative, edge-of-your-seat action, but so complex that it was difficult to keep up with...and only one of the characters is fully fleshed out.",1
431," best movie I have ever seen, Nolan's masterpiece. The entire cast is great one of the best ensembles ever. This film should put actors like Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hardy into the spotlight more often, two solid actors who have been making a name for themselves the past five years in indie movies.",1
432," When it comes to the director and writer of both ""Memento"" and ""The Dark Knight"" (Christopher Nolan) you already have high expectations for a movie before you even see the trailer, and especially a movie where an artist is given as much money as they need to do whatever they want. I went into ""Inception"" expecting a cross between ""Dreamscape"" and ""The Matrix"" and I came out of the movie having to say that it was a lot better than I expected. If you love thinking movies like ""Brazil"", ""12 Monkeys"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"" you are not going to be disappointed, and if you like action movies like ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" or ""The Matrix"" you aren't going to be disappointed either. Without spoiling the movie, ""Inception"" kept me guessing right up to the very last scene, and having seen it with my best friend we came up with 2 completely different conclusions about the story, and yet both of them work perfectly. THAT takes a ton of genius. If you are a lover of great films and ""Transformers 2"" made you think that everything coming out of Hollywood these days is less than stellar (to be nice about it), ""Inception"" will remind you that there are still great film makers out there and ""Inception"" will renew your faith in film. While ""Avatar"" may still be the king when it comes to the box office and sheer scope of applied CGI, ""Inception"" reminds us of what really great storytelling is all about. ""Inception"" was darn near film perfection, in my opinion, and now easily sits on my top 10 favorite movies of all time. Finally 2 things: See it in IMAX if you can, and I can't wait to see it again!",1
433," All you people who rated this movie in the red have no clue what an entertaining film is. Yeah it didn't make complete sense, but it really didn't need to make perfect sense to have me on the edge of my seat waiting for the climactic ending. And for the people who have compared this to Matrix you are idiots, this movie was nothing like the matrix you cannot compare the anti gravity scene to the matrix. This movie was original and well thought out quit hating.",1
435, Inception is an incredible film. All these people posting reviews stating that it is hard to follow could not be more wrong. The film has a lot going on but they make it as easy to follow as possible. Also people saying that Nolan is a bad filmmaker are watching the wrong films. I bet they think Brett Ratner and Paul WS Anderson are groundbreaking directors. The world needs more Nolans and less Rush Hour and Resident Evil directors.,1
436," A well-written, intelligent masterpiece that manages to maintain coherence, unlike the smug ""clever"" films of recent years.",1
437, Best movie I've seen in a long time... a loooong time.,1
438, This movie was great and really well thought out I was so surprised. I haven't seen a movie with that much storyline AND really good fight scenes. You do need to pay attention if you miss something or do not understand something you will end up like the guys down the list who reviewed it low. An intelligent well thought out movie. I did not like shutter island but this is completely different. DO NOT MISS IT!,1
439," Hollywood would call the BO on this film a ""builder"" - an understatement at best. One of the best films of the last 10 years.",1
440," Amazing movie. Christopher Nolan has done it again. I went to see this movie knowing that it would be great, but it ended up being GLORIOUS! I was amazed by the fight scenes, and was awed by the thought that was put into every detail. I watched it 3 times now and Im planning on seeing it again. A must see, but not for the viewer that lacks the ability to pay attention. Some say it was confusing, but it only was confusing if u didnt pay attention. My 8 year old nephew understood everything, and wouldnt stop analyzing every detail. Beautifully made movie.",1
441," Great story, great visual effects, great actors... I'd love to see it again asap, can't wait for the bluray to be released.",1
442, This movie is awesome! Its a well told story with great acting by a well rounded cast and Nolan's really shows off his directing skills. Visually stunning!!! Anyone who says otherwise probably didn't understand it the first time around.,1
443, Wonderfull! One of the greatest films ever!,1
444," This was an excellent movie, a rare movie with a great intelligent plot. It was original and probably one of the best movies ive seen in a long time. Is anybody else sick of seeing crappy review after crappy review of good movies lately? The only reason these people have given bad reviews is because they couldnt understand it, which I get, but that doesnt mean it was a bad movie just because YOU didnt get it. If you did understand it, you most likely would have enjoyed this movie.",1
445," This movie was amazing and as for the first tom M. up there who gave this a zero... batman has no jurisdiction. he will find you and make you squeal. just kiddin but your opinion is terrible. you dont like a movie because you arent smart enough to understand it? Go watch ""Wolverine"" and dont bother with any of Chris Nolan's films any more.",1
446," Firstly let me say that the pro critics shown on this page that rated Inception low, very low, must have only watched the completely silent, totally uninformative trailer (the original short). Either they didn't watch it or they are genuinely not smart enough to break the relatively steep learning curve of the movie quickly enough to enjoy it. And the learning curve is indeed steep. The movie progresses quickly and if you aren't quite able to work out the concepts that are ""between the lines"" you might end up leaving thinking what David Edelstein wrote in his review: ""Inception manages to be clunky and confusing on four separate levels of reality."" What he writes here is only half true. The movie is a bit confusing and leaves a lot of the thought work to the audience. It is NOT however ""clunky""; the concepts are provided very elegantly and with great depth from the start. Here is what I feel is one of the dumbest of the reviews of this movie, it is by Nick Pinkerton of the Village Voice. He says: ""It's obvious that Nolan either can't articulate or doesn't believe in a distinction between living feelings and dreams"" I was honestly totally blown away by the sheer idiocy this comment. Why? Inception spends the entire movie explaining EXACTLY this. The idea that (quoting Pinkerton again) the ""distinction between living feelings and dreams"" can become forever blurred is probably the single most critical concept of Inception. It provides the foundation for the antagonist and the dramatic aspects, the consequences of failure and death in this otherwise safe dreamworld. Remove this foundation and the movie becomes nothing more simple and dull action movie. It is blatantly obvious that Nick Pinkerton either didn't even watch Inception in whole or it simply was far above his ability to think critically; flying over his head with such speed there must be a burn mark. Moving on from the critics, the movie is quite good. It is smart and thought provoking, the kind of movie that keeps you excitedly discussing it with your friends on the ride home. It is an action movie that is spared from the current tediousness of action movies by the critical dramatic tenants of love, loss (and the ability to cope with it) and the sense of terrible consequences of failure, keeping you sitting upright and empathetic to the characters for the whole movie. That is really saying something considering that the movie is rather long at 2 hours and 30 minutes. This sort of length has ruined some movies by keeping you so long it becomes impossible to keep interest, ruining the whole experience. This is NOT the case with Inception. When the movie ended I was hugely surprised that so much time had passed. Inception keeps you fully engaged the entire movie and even after two and a half hours you'll find yourself wishing there was more. With the above in mind remember to hit the bathroom before the movie because there is simply no moment of the movie that is good to leave during, every moment is important and great. Go see it, I promise you'll like it.",1
447,"Not quite perfect, but a *lot* of fun to watch with a mind bending plot that leaves all other summer block busters in the dust.",1
448," Pure genius. Christopher Nolan has invented a wholly original and thoughtful film that takes you in to the hear of dreams. The visual effects, sound editing, and sound mixing are spectacular. If you pay attention throughout the entire film, you will not find it too confusing at all.",1
449," So Avatar and Toy Story got Higher Reviews. Clearly there are people in this world who don't appreciate great casting, acting, story, action and suspense. And would Ratherhave Movies like avatar and Toy story 3 that are not bad. But lack most of the above. Ps. not to sound cliche, but this was the first movie i was actually on the Edge of my Seat (along with everyone else in the Cinema).",1
450," Destined to be my favorite movie of all time. Stretches the mind as far as it can go and will leave you thinking for a long time. It also has an uncanny ability to weed out the idiots amongst our society. The critics who gave it 70% or less and the viewers who rated it 6 or below...all I have to say is survival of the fittest, you lose. Keep up please",1
451," It's an original concept. Directors, like Quentin Tarantino, Brad Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson and Christpher Nolan should be commended, because they've been able to entertain us with complex and thought-provoking material.",1
452, Great original story. Fantastic movie!,1
453, Simply amazing.,1
454, Inception was an EPIC movie all the way though it! i was on the edge of my seat! this i most definitely the years best movie yet!,1
455, This movie was great and had a complex plot. Special effects were a nice bonus. If you thought the plot was convoluted or boring... it's because you have the intelligence of a 10 yr old or don't have the attention span to read a book.,1
456,"  Original! Finally a movie that isn't an adaptation of a novel, sequel, or a remake! Excellent acting, amazing storytelling, and awesome visual effects. A movie that deserves Best Picture.",1
457," This is an outstanding movie. There isn't much quite like it you, me, or anyone else have ever seen. It is not for your average moviegoer, it doesn't have a dumbed down plot like some consider Avatar of doing and that is perhaps the greatest asset of the film aside from its originality. You WILL be sorry for missing it because after multiple viewings this film has filled the only spot in my mind that says: Masterpiece.",1
458," Like in Prestige and Memento, Nolan builds scenarios in his movies that rattle the mind, and cause the viewer to question everything they've seen. This is a fantastic movie, and it saddens me that people who can't comprehend the complexities of this movie have marred the user score and metascore with their negative ratings.",1
459,"  Leagues beyond what anyone else in Hollywood is able to even dream of, much less create, Christopher Nolan is quite simply the Leonardo Da Vinci of film, and Inception his Mona Lisa.",1
460," Great effects, spectacular imagery, appealing characters/cast (loved Marion Cotillard), and a terrific story that more than make up for comparatively minor shortcomings that need not be detailed in this trite review of mine. I've only chimed in here because I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where the audience reacted so positively at the end and kept up such a continuous happy buzz, from the moment we began to make our way out of the theater 'til the time we left the building and headed our separate ways (instead of simply dying out by the time we hit the escalator). I guess I'd say this was a cinematic AND sociological experience.",1
461," This is old fashioned epic movie-making masquerading as a summer blockbuster. The kind of film they don't, but should, make anymore. I fail to see where anyone could find this film confusing or hard to follow. All you need is something called an attention span. It should be a prerequisite for critics to have a certain I.Q. before they are allowed to review films. Best film of the year thus far. Highly recommended.",1
462, Oscar buzz here we come.,1
463," The best movie I have ever seen. Hands down. Watch it. This is the first good movie of the year. Good acting, plot, story, special effects. see it now.",1
464," Easily one of the best films of 2010. Sad to see it not gaining the full support of the critics, but something tells me that may be because the director, Chris Nolan, is being held to a higher standard than most (A.O. Scott seemed to be less than thrilled because it wasn't this century's Blade Runner or 2001 in his opinion, for example). That's too bad. Inception is original film making at its finest and it offers emotional payoff as well as a one hell of a deep labyrinth of a world to get lost in over and over again. Highly recommended.",1
465," An intense, thought-provoking mind trip with some of the heaviest tone and mood for a summer movie. After you leave the theater, Inception still stays in your mind.",1
466," The best film of 2010 hands down. This is Nolan's masterpiece. The Dark Knight was just a warmup to one of the best science fiction films I've ever seen. Up to the last few seconds it was an outstanding film. Once those final seconds hit though, the film transcends itself into being one of the best mindbenders I've ever seen. Unlike some films where twists require careful examination whether it makes sense or not, Inception makes you reconsider the film as it works in multiple perspectives. Time will be kind to this masterpiece.",1
467," This is not only the best film of this year but, it is one of the best films of the 21st century!!!! I have not said that about a single film I've seen in the last 10 years and that is because it took me many viewings of various films to put them into this category. Moives like Children of Men, Zodiac, and Pans Labyrinth where all films that ended up in the 5 or 6 of my top ten list in their respective years but, by the end of last decade had made such a lasting impression I placed them among my favorite films of last decade (also include The Dark Knight). However, I can firmly state that after the first time I saw this film I was sold. This is a masterpiece!!! A word thrown around a lot but, is truly earned here. This is a movie that has caused the less active viewers to have a difficult time with the plot. This makes me love it all the more. I love having my intelligence rewarded. I will not go into extreme depth here because I could describe the whole thing and you still would not get it until you see it. This film is a dual narrative film about a man, Cobb, who has lost his children and wants to get back to them. However, a lingering memory of his dead wife and some false charges will not leave him to move forward and be with them in America. Which leads to the second narrative about a man, Saito, who wants him to implant a memory into his business competitor so that his company can compete in an expanding energy market. Cobb must complete this job and let his wife go so that he can move on with his life. It is also about a host of other things and every character (there are many) is dealt with in a sufficient amount of detail considering all the rules that have to be explained in a movie like this. Some of these characters, Cilian Murphy especially, have emotionally resonant stories of their own that could have been their own little films. This film,however, is an action film and there is no shortage of it. The sustained tensioned created by the amazing editing of Lee Smith and the operatic score of Hans Zimmer is the longest I believe I have been on the edge of my seat in my life. I honestly believe that you can look for this movie to be nominated for close to 10 Academy Awards from Best Picture to Cinematography to Sound to possibly a nod for DiCaprio with the combination of his to fabulous performances this year and the underated Shutter Island less likely to land one (even though I think it is the best performance of the year) . And in a perfect world Christopher Nolan will finally receive his long over due nomination. I saw this movie for the first time Monday then again on Saturday and I still cannot get it off my mind. I know that this will eventually pass but I'm not sure that I want it to.",1
469," Although The Prestige is still my favourite of Nolan's works, never mind my favourite movie of all time, Inception is by no means just an alright movie. It is an absolutely perfect, mind-bending thrill ride. Emotionally satisfying.",1
470," this movie is original in almost every way. it had me guessing all the way to the end. SPOILER!!!!!!!!!! the only thing that did not come as a surprise to me was the recurrence of his wife, the way she managed to destroy certain dreams. i figured she would do that for the rest of the movie or until she was somehow dealt with. SPOILER OVER anyway great movie if you like the unexpected and jaw dropping effects then watch the movie. oh one more thing, the cast of actors the got is great, every character develops and none of them are forgettable.",1
471," Great movie and definitely worth the price of admission. It is one of those movies that you keep talking about days after you've seen it. However, it did feel as if the story idea is a twist off the Matrix concept which is why I didn't rate this a 10.",1
472," Will W: ""This movie is crap and too absent of logic too make sense. I could go into why but I don't want to spoil it. I feel like I need to go watch Predators again just to clear my palet."" This is what annoys me. People who go see a masterpiece like Inception and don't understand it seem to activate a self-defense mechanism in their heads which starts to give them the idea that just because the film was too clever it is therefore ""absent of logic"". Probably the same kind of person who though Transformers 2 was brilliant. Anyway, if anyone is on the fence about this film, GO SEE IT, seriously. You do have to pay attention, but if you do it should not be a problem to follow what is going on, and I assure you what is going on will not disappoint. Only Nolan could cross cut so perfectly between (at one point) four layers of dream action!",1
473," Seriously folks, do not listen to any other the reviewers who vote this movie less than 10. It is truely amazing and if you have half a brain you will love the complex story line and endless sub plots that make 2 and a half literally fly by!!! Best film I can remember seeing for a long while.",1
474, The ending is amazing.,1
475, This film is the best of the year. Period,1
476," As an artist myself, it brings me a lot of joy to say that Inception is one of the best movie ever made. It has everything you would probably want out of an action/adventure/suspense-thriller. Similar to how I felt about Avatar and my journey through the land of Pandora, I got the same guided tour through the dreams of the human mind.It has Casino Royal's gritty, espionage-like feel on top of the Matrix physics defying aggression. The movie literally captivates you for 148 minutes. The movie is epic, in a sense of the word. It takes you from a heavily populated city to Mombasa to some icy fortress. And if you pay attention you can never be confused the characters do a fantastic job of letting you/us the viewer know what's going on, it almost felt as if I was being spoken to directly. Adding to the experience is the superb acting by the entire cast Leonardo is in tip top shape as you would expect but he does not out shine the others, Joseph-Gordon, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy and Marion Cotilliard add phenomenal acting performances to the movie and you just feel, ""wow!"" I can't forget the score Hans Zimmer did a fantastic job on the score each matched the setting and feel of the backdrop. My favorite is Mombasa. However, the movie has it's hiccups, first there is the score, I know I just said it was amazing and epic. But when a score is that great, epic and loud there are moments where it needs to be tuned down for the sake of the dialogue.There are moments in the movie where the dialogue is supposed to be first to get the point further across however, the score seemed to overshadow it. Another fault was the emotion or from time to time lack-there-of; Leo has many struggles in this movie similar to his character in Shutter Island. But the emotional struggle between Cobbs (Leo) and his wife Mallorie (Cotillard) can feel distant at times. But you do feel the melancholy vibe in certain areas but I wish there was more of that. Bottom line, if you want a movie that gives you everything 100% and that is original, Inception is what you should invest your time in. It. Is. Worth it.",1
477," 2nd viewing was even better than the first! An impossibly ambitious premise executed brilliantly by all involved. A lot of exposition but it's all part of the plan (and besides, a lot of the film's detractors complain that it's confusing and clunky, and then proceed to do the same regarding the extensive exposition, which is kind of silly). As for the emotional resonance of the film, again the 2nd viewing was more rewarding, which is strange. To the people on here giving this 5 and below, some of the doing so to ostensibly 'balance out the hype""-that's absolutely ridiculous. If you didn't think it was a masterpiece or if you didn't enjoy it well fine-but it's not The Last Airbender or Transformers 2. Is it Kubrick's 2001? Nope. But it is the most cerebral and audacious 160 million dollar summer blockbuster of all time. Oh, and Predators was garbage. Some of you guys who liked Predators probably complained about a movie like Avatar having a regurgitated story (which it obviously does but fortunately it was kind of well mounted hahaha), and a film like Inception being derivative of Dreamscape (as if Nolan would have never come up with his premise if those film's hadn't existed, where). Again, ridiculous. At the absolute least, the debate surrounding the film is an indication that it has accomplished exactly what it was supposed to.",1
478, Best movie of the summer easily! It had a really lasting effect on me. Definitely worth a second watch!,1
479," With 'Memento', he bent minds with intricacies, with 'The Prestige', he showcased his consistency with finesse and intellect, with 'Batman Begins', he re-introduced a Hero from dark ravines, with 'The Dark Knight', he made iconic history in evil's greatest form and now; with 'Inception', he not only affirms his distinction as the most innovative and compelling film maker of our time but also epitomizes the best of Hollywood's intellectual, visual, graphic, technical, artistic and performing capabilities. His work is by no means inspiring because you simply cannot align your intellect with his imagination. 'Inception' perplexes on two main fronts: First, its mind twisting plot that challenges you through a maze of incredulous events and Second, the ability of the film to visually delineate all the endless possibilities of Nolan's intricately crafted dream world. ",1
480, Really not that complicated or intellectual.... it just treats its audience as people with brains and puts together a thoroughly enjoyable film.,1
481," It's not confusing if you actually pay attention... this movie was made for philosophical discussion, and I'm sure you'll be researching Rene Descartes after watching it. The action sequences were amazing, effects were superb as always. Great movie!",1
482," Absolutely brilliant. Acting, great writing, presentation ,,, its all there and its there to stay. This is not one of those movies whose name you will struggle to remember 5 years from now. Highly recommended.",1
483," This movie seems more about emotional espionage than dream theivery. The visuals tho excellent in everything Nolan means to show are amazing, it just never reaches (except the one market scene shown in all of the trailers/commercials) the ethereal level most of us would call the ""Dream World"". Its way to mundane and every day without the Fantastic possibilities of dreams. Great & many Layers of story that will keep those with attention spans griping their seats (those without will become agitated & restless) that has many a payoff. I guess I wanted more Matrix or Dreamscape fantasy visuals. But emotionally and this movie stands above those.",1
484," I was extremely skeptical about this at first because I didn't like Nolan's The Dark Knight nearly as much as everyone else did. Nevertheless, I gave this a chance and was very pleasantly surprised. The premise is just about perfect, and almost every single detail is covered as to leave no plot holes. Acting was great on all fronts, with Leo giving a rock solid performance. The visuals are also terrific, and the action scenes are a great break from all the shakey-cam nonsense filmmakers are going for these days. There were only a few confusing plot points that you could easily fill yourself in on at Wikipedia. Didn't feel too long, and the pacing was great. Many scenes were legitimately tense and frightening. By all means, go see this film. Ypu won't be disappointed.",1
485," Overall I enjoyed the movie, but my only complaint is on a technical level. The soundtrack to this movie drove me nuts. There is loud music CONSTANTLY playing (even in quiet moments), sometimes louder than the dialogue, and a couple of key players have accents making it impossible to understand what they are saying (due to the loud music). Even so, I was still able to follow the movie. In fact, the movie pretty much explains itself as it goes along. In the end, I was frustrated due to the loud soundtrack (could be the fault of the cinema I saw it in), but liked the film. I'm looking forward to seeing it on blu-ray where I can hopefully hear the dialogue better. I did not feel this movie was a masterpiece, as some are calling it, but it certainly was one of the best films I've seen this year. After seeing the really horrible ""Splice"" earlier this year, it was nice to see a well done Science Fiction movie.",1
486, Purely brilliant. Not much more I can see that hasn't been said already. A total breathe of fresh air in this stale business. We'll definitely see many Oscar nominations.,1
487, Very creative concept that is executed flawlessly.,1
488," I don't see how you can give this movie a 10. i also don't see how you can give it a 0. It's good, but it is overhyped and while I don't think there are a lot of flaws in what Nolan wanted to do, it just doesn't connect with me. Still, it's a very good movie, just not great.",1
489," I walked into this film with great expectations, I have been a Nolan fan since I saw Memento in 2001 when I was looking for a movie at the video library and saw a new Guy Pearce Movie. From that day on I have seen all of Nolan's stuff, as excited as I was I thought there was no way that this would be as great his last effort, The Dark Knight. Once Inception was over I realised very quickly that I was wrong. Inception is the best film I have seen in a long time, possibly ever! All the cast are simply brilliant from powerhouse Dicaprio to the intermittently seen Berenger. This film for me is an instant classic. I don't want to discuss the film too much because I feel that this film is better to walk into not know what you are going to get. The only advice I can give for this film is don't leave your brain at the door, this ain't Predators!",1
490," Do you trust a review to someone who can't spell ""palette""? if you didn't understand it, then you either were only looking for special effects or were high. it says something of our society when a film of this magnitude gets bad reviews by people who don't even pay attention to life, much less movies.",1
491, Fantastic. What a summer blockbuster should be. Looking forward to a second viewing.,1
493," Excellent movie, shame that it is too much for simpler folk to grasp as shown in the lower scored reviews.",1
494," Inception is not a movie, it is a genre in itself. It is a must watch for everyone.",1
495, Stunning in every way!,1
496," A 10 that makes me sorry i ever gave any other movie a 10. Almost perfect from start to finish! Another thing I love about this movie is that all those bad reviews (with the exception of A.O. Scott's, who always is sensible) make it easy to tell those who don't have the brain cells to follow a fairly complex film and now we can disregard any of their reviews in the future.",1
497," Almost flawless script, emotional intesity, sofiticated action sequenses, great performence by Di'caprio and above all - innovative in nomerous aspecs.",1
498," The only criticism (""not enough emotion"") misses the symbolism and the point of this movie. Inception was brilliantly revealed in layers, like the emotions and psyches of the 2 dominant characters (diCaprio/Murphy). The superficial layer had little emotion and the deepest had the most intense. I never write reviews but this movie I have to recommend as one of THE BEST MOVIES that MUST be seen in a theater. Better than Matrix, Malkovich, Memento, Brainstorm and all the other scifi concept movies about Consciousness/Dreams.",1
500," Nolan drifts back to the genius of Momento, accepting what M Night cannot. We can't always be fooled by a movie and Nolan knows this and creates a wonderful facsimile of suprise in this film. We know the end 20 minutes before the film finishes and Nolan knows this and makes a suprise ending none the less.",1
501," The movie moves with a ridiculous pace throughout. There is continuous action, and unbelievable special effects. The only negatives are that it is difficult to get very attached to any of the characters (other than DiCpario's) and the whole story is far-fetched.",1
502, Fantastic! Captured my attention from the first to the last moment. Even my 70 year old mother in law loved it (even if she didn't understand any of it).,1
503," Not the greatest movie of it's genre, but close to it.",1
504," Inception is *that* movie. The movie everyone will be discussing, debating and analyzing until the end of time. This generation's 2001: A Space Odyssey.",1
505," Of the five Christopher Nolan films I have seen before this, 4 have been truly exceptional movies, Insomnia was decent. So, I had huge expectations for Inception. It surpassed every one easily. Nolan weaves together a narrative stunning in its complexity, while keeping it coherent. I did not find it at all difficult to follow, as paying attention was easy with the spectacular visuals and action that keep even the easily confused glued to the screen. Even if all the small technicalities aren't kept straight in one's mind, the viewer is always aware of the emotional center and feels the gravity of the situation. I walked out of the theater fully satisfied, having enjoyed every moment of the movie right the last brain teasing scene. However, it wasn't until thinking about the plot later, that I began to grasp the true brilliance of it all. This film deals with themes like substance abuse, loss, family, and has religious overtones such as faith, and depictions of hell. While I normally find over-analyzing to be annoying, I can't help but feel that in those 10 years of writing this script, Nolan had a lot to say and created a genius and thought-provoking story on every level. He is the greatest director of hollywood blockbuster's today, bringing originality, emotionally heavy, and intelligent stuff to the table while remaining entertaining as hell. This is his masterpiece.",1
506, Of course this movie is the best movie this year till now! It has something different thing. i don't want to say it because it might spoil you from watching the movie. the music was great. What I know is that the director of dark knight is a really good director and never disappointed me.,1
507," Inception is the movie of the year, It was intense, cerebral, conceptually imaginative and action packed. If only more films were made with this level of ambition and guile the cinema would be a far better place to be. Its a shame that Inception will easily become the quintessential movie of its type, because there really should be more competition for that title. I was disappointed to see critics, obviously used to the likes of Snakes on a Plane and Hot Tub Time Machine, saying that Inception is 'confusing' and 'complicated' when it really isn't. It just happens to be more complicated that the average movie, which really isn't difficult to achieve, and just because you have to keep up during the film and you might be still thinking about it 20 mins after doesn't make it confusing. Come on guys! MAN UP! The thing that I really don't understand is people accusing Inception of being 'boring'. it just might not be your thing, which is fair enough as there's never going to be a movie that everyone likes and connects with, its impossible, however Inception is anything but boring.",1
508," This movie was more than I expected. I went in with huge expectations and this movie exceeded all of them. I really had a hard time leaving the theater, because my eyes just couldn't leave the screen.",1
509," Movie was great, and certainly connected my emotions...Just because you can't pay attention to a movie for more than two hours does not mean you can bash what your mind could not handle. Try to think during the movie and you will feel the emotion Nolan delivers. Clap Clap for the movie, well done.",1
510, I am 14 and understood this movie completely and thought it was one of the best movies i have seen in my lifetime!,1
511, Outstanding!,1
512," Not hard to understand if you currently attend or have graduated high school. If there was one, solid reason why this movie is so fantastic, it is because of its originality. The idea is so much more than ""ex-agent/cop kills everything that moves"" or ""romantic comedy, enough said."" It does make you think, which for me made the movie seem like it lasted forever.",1
513," Excellent, non stop action and interesting story.",1
514," Wow. I have never had a moviegoing experience like this. all i can say is that i was amazing. revolutionary. I cant imagine why this is getting bad reviews! Maybe people are too lazy too follow, or just being contrarians. Put pay attention, and you will be rewarded immensely. A masterpiece. I would even say this is one of the best films of all time. I plan to see it many more times!",1
515," The best cinema-going experience I've had in a long time. Multi-faceted genre with a great musical score, excellent acting, titillating action sequences, original concept and seamless storytelling. For it's complexity and the multitude of linear parallel story aches but with different parameterizations with respect to time, it was pleasantly easy to follow along for the average movie-goer, which I believe is testament to the great foundational strength of it's logic, directing, and execution. This movie had a lot of interesting themes to ponder over too, but more than anything, what amazed me was how in the process of watching it you find yourself in wonderment at the elegance and how it brings it all together seamlessly (if you look for the loose thread, you'll be looking for awhile, as if you were trying to find the 2nd side to a loop of paper twisted and fused at the ends). Whereas other movies will intentionally over-complicate a movie and cut-it up and mix it up to create abstraction, Inception has the complexity, but in a almost natural order, or mathematically, like a function f(a(b(c(d(e(x))))).",1
516," After a somewhat confusing (but necessary) first hour, the movie reveals itself to be a masterpiece. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite movies.",1
517," I'm surprised there are so many negative comments, I guess this is a love it or hate it film. Personally I absolutely loved it, and so did everyone I've talked to about it. It was one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Christopher Nolan delivers once again as he did with Memento and the Dark Knight.",1
518," From some of the negative comments it seems that a lot of people didn't like this movie because they found it confusing. I would therefore offer the advice that if you have trouble following clever and original movie narratives and like to stick to the same old generic storylines we're used to seeing over and over, then don't see this movie. For me, as a Christopher Nolan fan, it lived up to all my expectation and did not disappoint. 10 out of 10!",1
519," Inception is a masterpiece. After one viewing I can't wait smack down another 10 bucks to unlock some of the deeper narrative themes. That said after seeing it once Leo deserves an Oscar nod as does Christopher Nolan for directing, Wally Pfister for the cinematography, Han's Zimmer for the haunting musical score, and hopefully in choreography if alone for Joseph Gordon Levitt's awe inspiring weightless scenes. Go see it, and while your at it go see it again, cherish the experience because movies like this come along every couple of decades. Brilliant.",1
520," I'm an avid review reader, I can be pumped as all get out for a movie to come out, but it's reviews are bad, typically i won't go see it in theaters. I was delighted to see the early reviews for this movie roll in, perfect score after perfect score... my anticipation grew into something nearly uncontainable. Now I've seen it. And boy am I glad I did. I've seen about 10 movies in theaters this year so far... and this movie is, without doubt, the best (live action) movie I've seen in 2010. Some of the sequences were absolutely mind blowing, while others were so obvious, I was jealous that I didn't think of this movie first. Take the matrix, but instead of jacking into computers, jack into other peoples minds... simply(that's the key word) genius. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, the acting was great all around, the action was awesome, though not entirely original, and while the movie doesn't exactly keep you guessing, it does keep you on your toes. I don't know what movie some of these people here saw, but this was a highly entertaining movie. I would happily pay to see it again, and I would recommend it to anyone. Content notes: For a PG-13 movie, pretty tame on the language end of things... a few G-d's, but no F-bombs. And on the violence side of things, violent, but very little blood, and zero gore.",1
521, This is one of the best movies in recent time.Hats off to Mr. Nolan and Caprio.,1
522, Best movie this year so far. Definitely a thinking person's movie.,1
523," This is precisely why I hate the Village Voice reviews. They come across as pretentious nonsense, purely devised to go against the popular opinion. I can picture the editorial staff at VV conspiring against all the 'buzz' purely so that their negative review can stand out from the rest. Ridiculous.",1
524," If someone gave this film a bad review, it's because they have no brain to actually understand the story. People are always whining and complaining on how confusing Inception was. Well obviously those people didn't even watch the movie because if people actually paid attention, they'd actually understand what is going on. Second of all, if this movie isn't up for any Academy Awards then I'll be pissed. The Dark Knight wasn't up for anything 2 years ago, and Chris Nolan was ticked off. Although, the reason why he didn't make another Batman movie was because he wanted that academy award that he should've got 2 years ago. Nolan wanted to go even deeper, so the Academy would actually for once give him credit for something that no one has ever done. This movie is as good as the Dark Knight, but goes even deeper within the realm of mind. The Academy better be right this year because I'm not watching some crappy britain movie that no one even knows that somehow is better than Inception. This movie is the best movie of the year, and if it isn't then what is?",1
525, Best movie I've seen in a while. It really reminded me of the Matrix AND of how bad this summer's movies have been.,1
526," Like other Nolan movies, you are distracted from the film's narrative holes by his style and flair. But I still had a hard time getting past the film's central conceit of induced dreaming. And people don't dream as soon as they fall asleep. And aren't there easier, less cool ways to steal corporate secrets? And how did Cobb first discover then market his abilities? To me, this movie still does not supersede the Matrix, as I would have expected and which I thought we'd be capable of doing by this point in time.",1
527, This is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. I did not expect him to outdo TDK so soon in terms of greatness but he has. The fact that he wrote the script himself and hardly used the greenscreen CGI effect through fighting scenes in the film blows my mind. This is the best movie I have ever seen,1
528, Reminds me why I love the movies.,1
529," Incredible film, yet again dicaprio has produced an excellent performance and Nolan another original, genius masterpiece with stunning graphics and a storyline like no other. Full of action, emotion, depth and a concept that is extremely clever. This I think is the film of the year and will be eagerly waiting for it's blu ray release so I can watch it again. Absolutely incredible.",1
530, Superb and amazing. I can only assume any bad reviews are written by people who didn't understand it.,1
531," I would have given it a 10 after the first time I saw it. Now, after the 2nd time, I'd go at least 12 or 13. I liked it much better the second time. The first time, I was enthralled by the visuals and the basic guts of the story. This time I was able to focus on the intricacies of the story development, and that was just so incredible.",1
532," Nothing short than amazing. Great story, fine acting, and the second-half of the film had me on my toes the entire time. I don't know who these people are that are bogging it down as ""too confusing"" or ""emotionally lacking."" This film touched me on many levels: visually, mentally and emotionally. I saw the midnight show and can't wait to see it again.",1
533, Overcomplicated chaos.,1
534, Superb movie! Amazing visuals and some nice concepts..if not overly original. i started to flag half way through due to the high pace from start to finish..which is tough for 2 1/2 hours!:) I don't think it was confusing and wasn't let down by it not being better than other Sci Fi movies out there.(i wouldn't watch it again....unlike the matrix which always leaves the hairs on the back of my neck standing in the last quarter of an hour of the movie) If you take it for what it is... it's a good watch!,1
535," PHENOMENAL! That is all i have to say about this incredible movie, this interesting movie about how dreams work with your brain and the sub-conscious part of your mind really makes you say ""Oh wow!"" This movie had great action, especially in the dream state from level 1, 2, 3, and even level 4! This movie is by far the best of the summer!",1
536," This is really an amazaing movie, a little bit complicated but SO good!!",1
537," It wasnt that great.. i have no idea what is wrong with everyone.. its a very good movie... but far from great, something is missing.",1
538," Upon a 2nd viewing, I officially declare this movie a Masterpiece.",1
539," Definitely the best movie of 2010 so far. Everything about this was great,the acting,story,effects,everything was great. Good job Nolan. Keep up the good work.",1
540, Simply amazing. No other words could describe this mind-blowing masterpiece.,1
541," Fantastic movie - I absolutely loved it. You have to go into it understanding that this is a mythology that is going to have occasional holes. If you can put those aside and just get into the plot, you'll have a great time trying to process what's going on and enjoying the characters. Had too many gun-fights for my taste (especially since they weren't all that cool and seemed out of place), but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Christopher Nolan is quickly establishing himself as one of my favorite writer/directors, and the actors turned in some great performances. Highly recommended!",1
542," One of the best movies I have ever seen. To all of the people out there who say that it was boring, I feel bad for you because there was not one part where it got boring for me. I was focused the whole time. Also, it seems as if people who got too confused didn't like it either. The story was amazing and I was just in absolute awe the whole time I was watching it. It's also funny how everyone who didn't like it complains that the special effects were generic. What do you guys expect? The special effects were perfectly fine. I didn't think it was possible to not like this movie, I guess I was wrong. Seriously, I highly recommend this movie. Do NOT listen to the people who gave it a score of 1, they don't know what they are talking about.",1
543, Awesome!! Its very confusing though!! I'll have to see it multiple times to understand it.,1
544, Totally mind blowing! fabulous! Hard to follow for the first 10 minutes but once you got with the flow and feel of movie it was excellent! Every character was intertesting with Dom being the most complex. It was one of those film were you really make up your own ending. I felt at the end the viewr still did not know if Dom was dreaming or not?? Would the totem full or not?? I feel sorry for the ones that walked out half way through I think perhaps they could or wouldn't understand the concept of the film. Its maybe not a film for peope with closed/narrow minds. I simply cannot stop thinking about it. The detail Nolan went into for this film its easy to see why he was 10 years writing the script then a further 9 gaining experiance for a movie of this magnitude. Defo should get an OSCAR for BEST FILM. WONDERFUL,1
545," Easily the best movie I've ever seen in theaters. There were multiple moments where I needed to pick my jaw off the floor from being in such amazement. Amazing story, amazing acting, amazing effects. This movie actually deserves a 10 because I can't find anything to complain about. Leaving the theater I could not be happier, even after hearing all the hype this movie got.",1
546," Outstanding. It is one of the best films that I have seen in my lifetime. It is original, creative, and intriguing.",1
547, Superb movie. Will ruin all other movies for me for some time. Anything less than a 10 for this movie is nonsense or an attempt at sabotage...or maybe just stupidity.,1
548," I thought this was a great movie that truly tried to be original, but because of all the praise it's getting from the audience and the fact that it's #3 right now on the IMDB Top 250, I feel I have to point to its flaws. None of which are really with the plot, as Nolan has spent 8 years ironing it out, but with dialogue, the fact that the movie is CONSTANTLY explaining things (whether its plot or backstory), and the idea that everyone remembers everything about a dream when they wake up and that when we decide something in a dream, somehow we're sure to carry that decision onto the real world. Also, the acting wasn't impressive, I mean they were all good but Ellen Page is just as good in the commercials as she is here. DiCaprio doesn't add anything, and the same can be said for Cotillard. They're both great, but nothing special. The same with the direction. There wasn't a single time I was impressed with Nolan's direction; too many quick cuts constantly telling the audience what to look at. The visuals were stunning at times, but only because of the CGI, not because of the camerawork. Lastly, I thought the pacing was a little off. For example, there's an important moment when the team gets their mark into a room with one of their own (an important moment in terms of the entire film), but then Nolan brings us back to DiCaprio and Page to talk about his backstory. Which he narrates for us the whole time. Again, using dialogue to explain instead of using action to show. Overall though this was a great movie because of the ideas used here and the fact that even though the acting and direction didn't add much it was still solid. Which is what this movie is, nothing more and nothing less, solid.",1
549," It was an absolutely stunning film. From the music, to the special effects, to the engrossing story, to everything else, this is amazing. I went into this movie with a few speculations, and it blew my mind. It's the best movie of the year, by far. I can honestly say that it is the best movie I've seen in the last five years.",1
550," The concept itself is really complex and imaginative. On top of that, to visualize it and transpose it to film successfully, as Nolan has, is an impressive achievement. Well done. This film was epic, and I'm still feeling the shockwaves of its impact.",1
551," Truly a sci-fi masterpiece. I am not even a big fan of sci-fi, but this movie totally grabbed my attention from the opening scene and just wouldn't let go until long after the movie ended. I've seen it twice and i can say that it is not enough. I need to see it again. If a movie makes you think that much it definitely has strong qualities. The cast is excellent, and all on top of their game. Chris nolan always keeps you on the edge of the seat whether its with the dialogue, action, or a combination of the two. add hans zimmer to the mix and you get the first classic of 2010. this movie deserves plenty of oscar nods. i think Leo will finally get that oscar he's deserved for so long.",1
552, This is probably the best film I have seen. You need to concentrate to keep up but it's worth it. It's exactly how film making should be.,1
553, Great movie.,1
554," This movie has almost literally changed my life. It seems to be almost a repeat of what The Matrix did to me. It makes you think so much about what goes on it drives you crazy it makes you want to watch it over and over again. There is just so much thought put into this movie and it works out so well, that even with four different stories going on simultaneously that it still doesn't get confusing because Nolan's genius shines through and it all works brilliantly. Definitely my new favorite movie and absolutely Nolan's masterpiece. Must see for everyone.",1
555, A modern classic and an epic tour de force.,1
556, Great movie. The now classic ending is up for interpretation so I've begun aggregating theories about the ending of Inception at http://InceptionEnding.com,1
557," This movie is brilliant , this is the best 2010 summer movie out now. Christopher nolan has made an absolutely perfect movie from start to finish , i highly recommend you see this movie.",1
558," With the advent of the Internet, the moviegoer has the option of going on-line for a plot synopsis, prior to seeing a movie; an option that was unavailable in 1984 when ""Dune"" patrons were instead handed pamphlets by theater employees to help orientate the uninitiated masses not familiar with the Frank Herbert serial of sci-fi novels. Since most modern-day trailers lay out entire narratives in five minute encapsulations, anyway, and often for movies with stories so intellectually undemanding a small child could follow, it's ironic that the preview for ""Inception"" would be the one coming attractions spot which contains no spoilers or overt exposition, because arguably, the moviegoer may need a signpost or two. Unlike the dream logic that David Lynch employs, in particular, ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive"", films with multiple interpretations, this Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle probably has just one. The inherent confusion that distinguishes Lynch's best work is enjoyable because his narratives are coherently incoherent, while being lost in ""Inception"" can be a frustrating experience since this wildly ambitious, but deeply flawed would-be masterpiece is the very opposite; it's incoherently coherent. If the filmmaker updated the studio's hard copy gambit of yesteryear by instructing moviegoers to a website before viewing this somewhat derirative(David Cronenberg's ""Existenz"", Michael Gondry's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", heck, even Joseph Rubin's ""Dreamscape""), but admirable follow-up to ""The Dark Knight"", then Ellen Page, who is stuck with the chore of playing the film's tour guide, would be free to develop a personality. At one point, Adriane asks, ""Wait a minute; whose subconscious are we supposed to enter?"" She practically breaks the fourth wall. It's a good question, because we're not sure either.",1
559," Completely original. Great acting. Everything you'd expect from an amazing movie. When I first saw this movie, I was confused and I just wanted to see it again. After watching it three times, I consider my mind to be blown away. There has not been a moment where I have not thought about the movie.",1
560, Inception is a brilliant movie that defines the dream state. The thrill I got when I watched the movie is enough to bring me back at least once more!,1
561," Absolutely stunning in every way. It actually made me think about what was going on while the movie was happening but it all sunk in before the next part started. Anybody who complains that ""this movie is too complicated"" are a little slow-witted if you ask me.",1
562, An original multi-layered fantasy with some of the best acting to come out of a mainstream Hollywood movie in years. Nolan has yet to make a bad (or even mediocre) film.,1
563," More than a cinematic Orgasm, Inception is a multiple-cinematic-Orgasm!!!",1
564," Not a 10 because nothing's perfect, but this was seriously close. Unbelievably deep and intelligent story, and relentlessly gripping. Best film of 2010 so far.",1
565," Awesome, well written movie! and of course there's some fuck whos gona talk shit about it. not everyone has to like it but still some hater comments are just stupid.",1
566," Note: I think the review by JESSE B shows he is in fact a CRANIALPHILE and Director NOLAN should worry about this STALKER who wnats to get it on with his BULB! Now the movie; Great layers of story--- that will make the ADD cell/texting generation squirm and others feel so challenged to keep up, that they will finally quit and hurl insults at the filmaker for not just Entertaining them like the Big Dumb TV does at home! (they have been taught by our cultire to hate anything that makes them think too much, thats why only 15% of us show up to vote). My man beef is it never says how they get into peoples dreams, and new comers (like Ellen Paige's character are not blow away when told about it). - Also they dreams are not very ""dreamlike"" very mundane, and no really cool dream powers are used. great emotional story and many layers - just not Fantastic dreamlike stuff.",1
567," ""Inception"" is absolutely astonishing! It's ""Mission: Impossible"" with a screenplay by Franz Kafka and Carl Jung. Those with room temperature I.Q.s should probably avoid it and wait for the next Roland Emmerich movie for their action fix.",1
568," This is a great movie by a great director. Nolan has made a movie that has a chance of getting movie of the year. Some people have gave this movie a bad review for saying things like "" Oh we have seen this before and its just the matrix. Guess what Nolan has said that he wanted to make a mix of the matrix and dark city and that is what this is and people who have said we have seen this before well we have there have seen movies that deal with reality so whats your point. that does not made this a bad movie you morons you people just didn't understand!",1
569, A mind blowing drama. Christopher Nolan has done it again.,1
570, Great movie. I highly recommend it.,1
571," Best movie of the year so far, love love loved it!",1
572," Truly astonishing This is not your average film. It delivers something original, thrilling and immersive. The ending is pretty amazing aswell. Be Warned This is a very mature and complicated film, I would not bring someone that is under the age of 14 unless they were clever.",1
573," Beautiful movie. Left to be interpreted by the viewer, like any true art. Full of heart...obsession, love, death.",1
574," The best movie I've seen in a long time. Absolutely epic. I just saw it about 3 hours ago and I'm still reeling. It's a fully realized film, with amazing acting, filmography, special effects, but most of all, plot. It's not only an action film, but a psychological thriller, science fiction epic, and emotionally wrenching drama. Easily the best film I've seen in years.",1
575, Easily one of the best movies ever made. But I will say you will either love it and think that it is a original idea for a movie or you will hate it.,1
576," This movie is definitely not for everyone. It has a nice balance that I find very hard to find in movies anymore. There is enough depth to keep me thinking, enough action to satisfy my testosterone needs, and a majority of the film is set in the very beautiful setting of the mind. All of these things build up the climax to a peak that honestly left me breathless. See it twice.",1
577," Words can't describe how much I love this movie. I knew I would enjoy it, but to have it rank among my all time favorite movies is a testament to its greatness. Truly, a work of art, and one all should take time out of their schedule to see.",1
578," I was afraid that the commercial success of the ""Dark Night"" C. Nolan will fall (like other promising directors) into the blockbuster with lots of stars with big budget with a useless story, just to make the Studio happy to gross money on his fame alone. None of that. I believe he has delivered one of the best movie in the last ten years. I can understand some critics that say he could have gone further into the ""delirium"" of the story; or others who believe he went too far to be watchable. But if you keep an open mind, appreciate the actors play (All the cast is really good), and give credit to Nolan's details of the script, you will enjoy that movie a lot.",1
579, Fantastic!,1
580," Probably closer to a 9.5. Really great movie. Top notch acting, enthralling story, and an open ending that leaves the viewer quite unsure of what they just watched.",1
581, I absolutely can not stop thinking about this movie. Just as there is multiple layers in the dreams there is multiple meanings that can be taken from it. Really makes you think... amazing stuff.,1
582," One of the most complex movies i've ever seen, more directors should follow in Nolan's footsteps. too bad that as soon as anything comes out, that isn't understood by the masses, suffers poor reviews. you dont understand the movie and its plot, dont rage that it's shit. the problem is in your yard.",1
583," This movie does slap a challenge in your face from the get-go, starting in medias res - and what a media res your thrown into. You put together what's going on in bits and pieces, when someone shouts info to someone mid chase. But the other problem is that this movie takes place in different worlds which also is a challenge. I was amazed that it did make sense and the plot held together even though it shifted from the Inception to the husband-wife suicide resolution. My only objection is that Nolan could have toned down the imaginary/real shooting which for me became a busyness obstacle that had to be overcome to.",1
584," Brilliant, exhilarating, monumental!",1
585," This movie is a masterpiece. Confusing at first, but it turns into a smart idea from beginning to end. And the ending is genious, but not spoiling it.",1
586, Fantastic. See it... especially if you're cerebral and like to figure out puzzles.,1
587," I'm convinced people who don't like this movie just aren't smart enough to follow it. There are plenty of stretches that are made that make it work, but so does every movie that takes you for a ride. But I go to the theater to be entertained and Inception is exactly that: pure entertainment.",1
588," The challenge in seeing a movie with such great hype and expectations is that the bar just may be set too high. That's the case, to some degree, with my reaction to Inception. The first third is setup, sometimes too talky and dry. The suspension of disbelief on this one?--too much. The premise is such a stretch. Plus, when the movie picks up steam on the back end, it has a familiar, high tech chase movie feel. (By the way, there are so many missed gun shots -- how could the aim be that off from so many bad guys, but the good guys are on the money?! Distracting and cheap.) On balance, it's a kick to see some of the special effects. The actors are solid. Very watchable. And the troubled lead role, ably played by D'Caprio adds depth, along with the layered, clever story. The ending is perfectly structured--love the thinking behind that approach. It's a big screen movie that deserves that scale of viewing. Far better than the average no-brain-required action flick. But, far from groundbreaking.",1
589, You need to watch this movie 3 times to see how brilliant it is. This is one of the best movies of all time. The haters are just dumb people.,1
590," A movie to pay attention to, literally, or you might miss something! ""Mal"" is French for illness, and is also the name of Dom's wife - was she even real, or just an illness in Dom's psyche??",1
592," Despite my best efforts, this movie thoroughly floored me. It's the best combination of action, intelligence, and intrigue I've seen since Blade Runner. Fantastic concept, brilliantly acted. There are some small nitpicks with the plot, but this is still, easily, my favorite movie this year - and frankly one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.",1
593," Nolan's been holding onto this story for over fifteen years, editing & analyzing it over the entire time to make it just that bit better. Of course, being a film of Nolan's it was always going to be above adequate, but he's really blown everything else on at the moment out of the water. Excellent acting, excellent story, excellent directing.",1
594, Best Movie Ever.,1
595," Every time Nolan seems to be steering Inception off the path of solid narrative into an aesthetic world of fantasy and special effects, the plot always takes a twist that throws everything back into perfect rationality. An instant classic.",1
596, Incredible.,1
597," Best movie ever, it really makes you think about your dreams and reality",1
599," Excellent movie. I scroll down the list of comments, and I see strings of 10's, the occasional 6, and some 0's. The 10's all came from people who fully understood this complicated movie (although if you think a little bit, you can understand it), the 6's were from people who enjoyed it, but did not fully understand it, and the 0's- well, have no clue. I give this a 9 because of the visual effects, captivating storyline, excellent concept and the constant traps and situations that made us begging for more. The positives FAR outweigh the negatives- there are a few though: the complexity (which is great to me and many others, but those who cannot understand will give this a 0, so this is both a positive and a negative), the length (just a bit long, but very tolerable), and the lack of background in some parts (Dom and Moll's relationship, for one). Still, very good movie, completely disagree with the 0's, and honestly, no movie is a true ""10"", in my book, as all movies have pitfalls somewhere. In the end, Nolan is awesome and I can't blame you guys for giving 10's, i am too still shocked. This movie does not deserve an 8.3 rating, and one last thing-- Who agrees with me?",1
600," To will w, really, u gota watch preditor again, that just shows that it doesnt make sense to u, cause ur stupid. im not the smartest person in the world either, however i realize that sometimes there are stories that make no sense cause of bad writing, and then the make no sense cause i (or u in this case) simply dont understand it. as far as the movie itself goes, i personally liked the dark knight better, however i believe that this movie was great. i was lost for a bit, but if u pay attention through the whole film, itll be worth it. good movie, but some people might have to watch it twice if they dont pay attention.",1
601," This is not your lazy popcorn movie. It requires your full attention and memory banks to keep track of all the things going on with the flashes from ""reality"" to dream(s). In short, it makes the first ""Matrix"" movie seem like a childrens story. This flim should get the acadamy nod for best editing since to keep this all together, including the time distorsions from dream level to dream level, and not letting the required 'talkiness' of the characters run it into the ground, is a masterful. This is one to see twice, three times... or in your dreams.",1
602, Awesome movie. Probably one of the best movies I've seen in 10 years. Sterling work on every level. I will go see this again.,1
603, Another visually ispiring work of art.,1
604," Not since Reservoir Dogs have I immediately booked tickets again for a movie directly after watching it, and believe me I enjoyed it much more the second time around. Simply brilliant on so many levels, this is now my favourite film of all time (sorry Se7en :).",1
606, Simply amazing..very addictive movie..2 hours & 30 minutes of pure greatness..it is yet another epic by Chris Nolan..with an incredible cast..effects that will blow your mind away..with music..that serves as an emotion ..This is an unforgettable classic.,1
607, Amazing mind trip without the need for any drugs. You will walk out exhausted.,1
608," If you let yourself get washed away with the film, it will reward you with novelty. If you go in expecting an awesome action movie, you will drown of boredom. Like most who went in thinking it would be like Batman or Memento, you expected something this movies was not meant to be. Before I saw this film, I saw a snippet of the action sequence and thought it laughable. So I went in with new expectation of just novel storytelling. PS: don't go stoned, it would probably make it feel boring.",1
609," This movie is Amazing!! I couldn't believe how good it was. There was plenty of action, clever plot, great cast, excellent script, the effects were amazing. I just can't believe how many people are giving it bad reviews bc they didn't understand it. I think that's crazy. From the beginning to the end this movie does a good job of putting you in the story without being over the top. The action seemed more lifelike than other movies that make their action to be unrealistic. The end really got me though.... Great ending. This movie is definetly a masterpeice and I feel bad for whoever disagrees. Best movie I have seen in a long time.",1
610," Christopher Nolan pulls through once again with an interesting story and fast-paced plot mixed with action. This movie was great because it was in depth, however not too intricate for a normal movie-goer to follow. It had the perfect amount of intensity, insight, and drama that all audiences would surely love.",1
611," After seeing this movie for the second time it made a bit more sense, but the problem with the whole thing is that it didn't actually had to make sense but it tricks us all the way in to pretending that it does. But the core problem of it is that is difficult to feel anything for those characters that we never really get to know and what is supposed to be love is just an annoying nightmare. On the positive side, it sure is entertaining (if you're not bothered by the pompous soundtrack) and there are some great (unintentional) shots of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's butt.",1
612," Amazing piece of art from Nolan. It's a bit risky to make movies like this when pople's brains are totally destroyed by sequels and remakes. Go on, Cris.",1
613, It was so awesome i literally blew my mind away. but the part where the guy puts the people in the elevator and tie them up in 3 minutes was kinda of unrealistic other than that great movie!!!,1
614," If anyone thinks that this film is complicated, then surely they should not be reviewing this film, look at those poor ratings, ""The New York Observer"" for gods sake, do they really know anything about films, If you didn't like it, your either a little kid or haven't even seen it.",1
615," This film is one to be seen but Nolan makes a mistake by masking the story as an over the top action film. Sometimes, we need a moment to pause and reflect on what we are seeing. The sensory over load here really detracts from feeling satisfaction or appreciation for the movie. I also thought that Ellen Page was simply wrong in her role. She contradicted the complexity upon which everything was based. David Lynch knows how to do this type of film.",1
616, Don't let the first 30 minutes or so fool you.,1
617," I'm not sure what many of the negative reviewers were looking for when they saw this movie. Half the negative reviews are ""It's too complicated"" and the other half is ""It's not complex enough."" The movie was a great ride, even with its flaws. The only thing this movie suffers from is a few plot holes regarding the way the dream world works. If you are willing to suspend disbelief a slight bit, this movie will be a thrill to watch.",1
618," WOW, see this movie! Mind = Blown.",1
619, This has become my favorite movie. I wont go into too much detail bc it has already been said just re read the #1 raings on the top.,1
620, Great movie!! such a smart piece of film!!,1
621," A very well done movie that makes think how in depth your dream can become, and how easily it could be to confuse reality with dreams.",1
622," If you're a fairly clever person, this movie will astound you. If less so, it may make little sense.",1
623," Excellent film, had me gripped all the way through. Complicated structure requires concentration, but well worth the 2 1/2 hours.",1
624," I'm seriously tired of people giving bad ratings for things just so they can get the shock value and publicity. a 25? seriously mr rex reed? though not perfect, it was an entertaining film that doesn't deserve to be torn apart by douche bags.",1
625, Great movie the way the actors carry themselves was spot on. It surprisingly was very witty with Joseph's character. Great special effects definitely waiting to buy the film.,1
626," Absolutely amazing, definitely one the best and most interesting movies I have ever seen.",1
627," Amazing ride from start to finish. Totally imaginative. There is nothing wrong with this movie, don't believe those critics!",1
628," I read the reviews after I saw the movie, mainly so I wouldn't be swayed a certain way. What I realized is the ""critics"" who rated this movie poorly most likely couldn't keep up with the movie. I'm assuming ignorance prevented them from enjoying this GREAT mind bending movie.",1
629," This video is amazing out of pure originality, one of the best movies I have ever watched",1
630," This is by far my favorite movie of 2010 so far. Toy Story may have a much better emotional story, but this movie truly delivers on so many more levels than just emotion. When I saw the first trailer for this movie, I knew that there was going to be a surreal element to it, but I was not prepared for exactly how complex and alien this movie would become. This movie shares many ideas used by other Sci-Fi, Heist, and movies of Nolan's past. It has the noirish feel of Memento, the look of The Dark Knight, a few moments that seem like they were ripped out of The Matrix, among many more. Even though it may sound like it borrows from so many, for me to say that would be a false statement. It refines each element and has a unique twist as to how they occur and how they are played out. The special effects do falter a bit in the beginning, but from there on out it is a truly beautiful display of the technology that Nolan' studio decided to use. The story starts out with a Mr. Cobb. He specializes in a certain type of theft. The theft of information. They way he does so is completely original, so I shall not spoil the how the technique is used. After the first job in his movie, he is asked to do the exact opposite of extraction, the thought of theft. This job is called inception which is the planting of a thought. As simple as this may sound, it is one of the most complex acts ever played out. I can tell no more, as it would ruin the true ""wow"" effect of this movie. Long story short, watch this movie now.",1
631," I can't imagine every positive, or even decent review, can be from people and critics who are just champions of Nolan's work. When it comes to reviews, like the one given by Mr. Nick Pinkerton, it's best to know [Ed: personal attack omitted] the man reviewing the film. It is the same Nick Pinkerton that described The Sorcerer's Apprentice as ""fine PG malarky."" Inception is by no means a perfect film, nor is it ""drivel."" It does, however, explore a subject matter which is difficult to do successfully in fiction. One weak spot of the film is the lack of engaging characters that seemed to make previous Nolan films great. Other than Cobb's (DiCaprio) storyline, there is little emotional investment in any of the other characters. However, Inception's success is in its ability to incite the viewer's introspection. I left the theater wondering about my own dreams and what they mean to my life. The mark of a good story is one that stays with you long after it's over. Inception awakens a childlike curiosity about your life, your relationships, your dreams, and how mysterious the subconscious truly is. To say people only like the movie because of the director's name, it is a gross misestimation of the general public. If you were only thinking about special effects when you left the movie, you paid too much attention to the wrong things. Unfortunately, some can not see the forest for the trees.",1
632," An expertly crafted film from top to bottom, it's near perfection and there's hardly ever a dull moment.",1
634," Best film I've seen in the past few years, let alone this year. Absolutely excellent work.",1
635,"  This movie, the script, acting and direction were all amazing. I hadn't been this intrigued by a movie since Mr. Brooks with Kevin Costner. wardrobe and set design were tailored to a t. I have ro go see it again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Overall, great movie.",1
636, Anyone who says that this movie is confusing should probably read more. And if you think the movie is boring then you should have gone to see Predators which would cater to your shorter attention span.,1
637," An original movie! What a concept! Thank you, Mr. Nolan!",1
638," Fascinating and very, very different from anything I've ever seen.",1
639," Has a smart and original script that keeps you guessing about at least one of the many subplots. The cast and acting was great. It was all around a good movie. You wont understand this until you have seen the movie but, inception planted the idea of doubt in my head as to what the outcome of the movie really was. This movie has a rating of 11 in my books.",1
640, THE movie to see of the summer and by far the best (non-pixar) movie so far this summer. The characters are likable and the writing goes above and beyond.,1
641," Good but i have seen this movie before, it was called Existenz.",1
642, Riveting. Enthralling. Deep. Worthwhile. The mental attention you put into this film pays dividends as the work progresses.,1
643," Best movie I've seen this year. Even unrealistic chase scenes can be rationalized in a dream world. Blows your mind. Was the reality at the end real, or was it still a dream?",1
644, Most original and mind blowing movie I've seen since the original Matrix. Seriously. Amazing.,1
645," I have been waiting to see this movie since I first read about it, and was reading reviews all week getting excited, but seeing it STILL blew me away. It was brilliant. This is not just a great movie but a masterpiece. Unique, complex, full of great action, and enjoyable characters. This is Christopher Nolan's crowning achievement (so far), and a movie masterpiece.",1
646, This movie was absolutely fantastic. Breath-taking and just awesome.,1
647," This movie blew me away. Absolutely captivating from start to finish and relentlessly involving. It does not take a genius IQ to keep up with the plot but this movie does require an investment of the viewer's attention. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is not your average brainless ""shoot 'em up,"" and that is why I loved ""Inception."" This year's grandest mind-f***, and an absolute classic.",1
648," Great movie, smart script but great action sequences too. All the actors were well chosen. Just go see it!!!",1
649," The production value alone makes it worth seeing, but the complexity of the story makes it worth seeing twice. Possibly the best movie to come out so far this year. The only reason someone could hate it is if they didn't follow it... which it's really not that hard to.",1
650, Completely original and amazing.,1
651," Nolan weaves an intricate and well-thought sci-fi story from start to finish, but doesn't fully succeed in capturing the real personality of dreams... the ones I saw in Inception were surprisingly lucid, lacking in the absurd and random aspects that truly define the dreams we have every night. Aside from that, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, with a truly mind-bending fight scene in a tumbling hotel room being my highlight of the movie.",1
652, Superb film with some jaw dropping scenes and a superb cliffhanger of an ending.,1
653,"  A truly amazing and mind-blowing film that knocks any thing else this year (and perhaps this decade) out of the water. The one thing that this movie requires is intellect (which all good movies should), and if you can muster that, then I guarantee you will walk out of the theater completely mesmerized.",1
654," Inception throws you in the deep end immediately, with exciting new ideas and concepts which are brought to life with fantastic visuals. And from then on the movie just goes from strength to strength. The film is filled with emotional insights, humour and clever twists. DiCaprio is imminently relatable and the rest of the cast all play their roles brilliantly - this is what cinema is about. The film climaxes as it reaches its end and we're left with a tantalising, thought-provoking ending. As a whole, Inception brings a whole host of fascinating concepts to the table and drives them through an exciting story-arc. It's a brilliant film and one I'd highly recommend watching.",1
655, Intense and mind blowing from start to finish!,1
656," The best film I have seen in many, many years. The movie was over hours ago, and it is still messing with my mind and concept of reality.",1
657," Not a perfect movie, but a very great film from talented director Christopher Nolan. ""Inception"" isn't quite as complicated as many people say it is, though it's certainly a film that rewards attention to tiny details and seemingly pointless dialogue that eventually loops back around and proves important in latter stages of the film. ""Inception"" is simply an exercise in imaginative story structure, and you're simply hanging on to Nolan's twisted ride. Don't visit the bathroom or concession stand once the lights dim, or you WILL be lost and there will be no point in you staying for the rest of the moive. This is surely one of the year's best films, and a probable Best Picture nominee that will dazzle some, anger others, but leave everyone's heads spinning from its memorizing philosophies and subconscious changes.",1
658," This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Anyone giving this a review under an 9 is simply brainless, if you followed along you would have realized nearly everything in this movie was done to perfection.",1
659," Inception was an amazingly mind blowing experience! Everything from the acting to the score was top quality, and the the plot kept you wanting more.",1
660," I don't understand the reviews stating it was confusing or hard to follow, you literally just have to be watching it the entire time to enjoy it. It's hard to take 2 of the severely negative reviews seriously when Village Voice doesn't like anything that isn't pretentious indie art house garbage (yes there are good indie films but quite a few are pretty much film school trash that somehow got released), and all of Rex Reed's taste is in his mouth. This movie isn't perfect, but it is intelligent. The characters are well fleshed out, the visuals are incredibly crisp and always interesting, and it is highly accessible to pretty much everybody, and above all it is entertaining the whole way through. So many of this years summer films don't even succeed at being entertaining on a mindless level.",1
661," Amazing movie! Everything is perfect in this movie ,Screenplay, Directing, Cinematography, acting, Edit, Music , special effect , ... everything . Best movie of the year so far , no doubt! Everyone must see it.",1
662," This is an amazing movie that will stick with you for a long time (despite what Mr. Scott from the Times may suggest). It lives up to the hype, which in and of itself say a lot. The ending will delight if you allow it to spark your imagination. By the way, note the sources above that gave this movie a 50 or below, and do not waste your time with these reviewers in the future.",1
663," An endearing film of functional complexity, rare originality, and effortless performance. It tells a story that--if followed closely--will engross the viewer in a 2-hour-plus roller coaster ride. DeCaprio leads the film with confidence and dignity, and the ""corporate espionage gone dream"" plot will keep audiences pleasantly perplexed, but most of all--utterly entertained.",1
664, Ground-breaking. Best Nolan movie yet and one of the best movies of all time. It will be a cult movie in due time.,1
665," Great, every detail of the movie was carefully placed.",1
666," Seen it twice, was absolutely astounding both times. Its the most original and satisfying piece of cinema to come out of Hollywood in years, and, dare I say it, it may be one of the greatest films ever made. An instant classic.",1
667," This is one of my favorite movies from the past few years and I watch a LOT of movies. This film is not only exciting, it is a thinker. Great special fx and sound design too. A really fun ride from start to finish!",1
668," I love smart, thought-provoking films. With this you also get visually stunning scenes. Chris Nolan never disappoints. I think this is the first oscar worthy film I have seen this year.",1
669," Stunning film, absolutely amazing.",1
670," Lisa M., while I agree this movie wasn't nearly as complicated as people (most people today don't think period look at the music industry) make it out to be and it did have it's cheese to it, you have to kidding me if you think there have been serious movies within the past say 10 years that exceed this one. You said the movie didn't require much though then you went on to name a mainstream series like the Matrix in your list of ""thoughtful"" movies... get out of here the matrix was another action movie with a lot of special effects and besides being original the plotline etc was rudimentary at best... The thirteenth floor? Don't even get me started.",1
671," Nolan delivered with The Dark Knight what was the defining Action - hero movie and probably my personal favorite of all time. I have to say Inception not only topped The Dark Knight in plot, acting, and script, it also has action that stands on the same level and mind boggling scenes of wonder. The scale is huge and causes you to think for hours after seeing. Nolan truly surprised me and this movie should hopefully, finally earn him an Oscar. Also, acting by Di Capprio was brilliant and the score by the always great Hanz Zimmer was outstanding.",1
672," It looked interesting, but the tight camera shots and rapid scene changes incorporating a lot of physical motion, and some of the effects, like bending half of the city of Paris skyward, literally made me feel dizzy and I had to leave the theater early.",1
673," The first 45 minutes of the movie I had NO idea what was going on, made more bizarre by flash forwards and back in time. Be prepared to have to really think to follow this bizarre plot. Fairly long movie as well. Worth seeing on the big screen though.",1
674, It was alright. I was kinda confused by what was going on.,1
675, I liked this movie when it was called Paprika.,1
677, This movie was probably the most entertaining film I've ever been to. I was literally hanging on the edge of my seat the entire time...sweating so much that I practically had to take a shower afterwards. Any critic/user who calls this boring has got to be out of their minds. Top 5 movie of all time for me...I really hope it gets some serious consideration from the academy.,1
678," This is the best movie this year period!! From the concept, to the acting, sound/visual efx, production are all top notch. Christopher Nolan deserves an award and even a Nobel prize for this . To all those saying the movie was incomprehensible, crap e.t.c.. please go and watch so dumb ass movie because it's pretty obvious YOUR brains cant muster enough power to know what went on in the movie.",1
680," This is a thinking persons movie. It's complex, it will blow your mind, and make you question what is real.",1
681, As far as I'm concerned this movie easily sits in the top ten movies of ALL TIME. Put frankly this has dine so many original things that it is now worthy of that title.,1
682," Alot of people who dont love it are probably to stupid to be able to actually think about what this movie is doing, it all makes sense, but you have to see it multiple times to fully understand what nolan is thinking, and once you decide to stop hating on nerds and games, and geek culture, then you might stop being so biased as to give it a fair reveiw score, critics.",1
683, Film Perfection.,1
684, This movie was a true masterpiece. Well acted and well written and directed. Should set a standard for future Hollywood movie installments.,1
685," One of the most amazing movies I have ever watched. Christopher Nolan is the director of our generation and further proves it with this masterpiece. Some critics say that this movie has no heart but i strongly disagree. Heart is what drives the movie forward and adds conflict to an already strong story. The special effects are incredible and contribute to the most amazing fight scene I've ever watched, each actor is spot on, and the story is clever and keeps you thinking about it long after the credits roll. I've seen it 3 times already and do not plan on slowing down. A tip of the hat to Christopher Nolan. He has somehow trumped The Dark Knight with yet another movie that will go down in the record books for years to come.",1
686," A mind-bending thriller unlike anything you've ever seen. Inception is an intelligent, reality-altering work of genius that is meant to be seen over and over again -- preferably in theaters!",1
687, It's the best movie i've ever seen.,1
688," I have never seen a movie this original, the plot is so complex yet the concept is easy to understand, at first i didn't completely understand what was going on but the story unraveled itself and when i thought i finally got the film the end came in and confused the hell out of me, but the end was good because it gave a new outlook on the film which i definately think is up there with all the other excellent decaprio films. a must watch for a experience you won't forget in a hurry.",1
689, How is this not higher. This is leagues beyond Avatar's quality. So spectacular.,1
691," Going into a movie with this much hype is scary. I think that fact needs no explanation, but when a hyped up movie surpasses all the hoopla and leaves you in a complete trance, you know it's something remarkable. After The Dark Knight, I thought there was no way Nolan could do it again, but I was very wrong. This movie twists your brain, but there is never a time where I felt it was disjointed or lost its way. The whole idea behind the movie may be unrealistic, but it is so well written and played out that it feels real. Another plus is that through all the info the movie feeds at you, it still keeps some incredible action. The fight scene in the rotating hallway is brilliantly shot. The acting, directing, writing, and score are terrific. The last notes of the movie give me the shivers. This is cinema firing on all cylinders, and I'm so happy that we were given this breath of fresh air. Those who disgrace this movie need to learn to open their minds to the impossible. Inception is, in one word, phenomenal.",1
692," Here we have an original movie that's just short of amazing, it gets most everything right. I was completely immersed and interested in the story. It's refreshing to see special effects again that actually take your breath away. The very talented ensemble cast and thrilling music must be noted. In fact, the only minor problem I had was that I was often reminded of DiCaprio's last film, where he's also troubled with reality and has wife issues along with two children (which is in no way the films fault). Inception is definitely one of the best films of the year; it'll keep you thinking until the very last second. Grade: A If you enjoyed this review, please read my other short reviews at www.jasonthecritic.com - Thank you!",1
693," Avatar got a 84 and Inception hits 74?????? Something is seriously wrong with movie critics understanding of what makes an enjoyable flick. I found the movie almost scary...Nolan and the actors had me feeling as if I were about to be trapped in my own dream, not wanting them to go deep because of what might happen. Great flick!",1
694," Overall the movie was a sucess, especially given the state of Hollywood these days. It's very hard to find a movie that is as original, bold and intellectually stimulating as Inception. Yes, it did have its faults, but what movie doesn't. If you are looking for a movie that delivers action, emtion and a thought provoking plot, Inception is your ticket. Breaking down the elements: Plot - complex but traceable. You will not lose your mind, but it does make you question your own preception of the subconscious. B+ Acting/Characters - acting was ok to good, but the cast line up might have been too ""Hollywood"". No-name actors might have provided viewers a better chance to connect to the characters. C+ Theme - multiple, intertwinded themes that are overall good but a little convoluted. B- Setting - great CGI effects that adhere well to the plot of the story and its elements. Each new setting provided emition that was spot on to the feel of scene. A Audio - the music ran well with the plot line, but it was overall flat and not diverse enough to catch every potential out of each scene. B- Overall Grade: B+ (not averaged).",1
695," Fantastic movie. A bit confusing at first, but overall amazing.",1
696, By far the best movie I've seen in years.,1
697," An absolute blast of a film. Christopher Nolan has done it again with this epic masterpiece! Metacritic, you need to put up more of the positive reviews that Rottentomatoes has. There are at least 10 tip critic reviews that you are missing out on! This movie deserves a much higher score than 74!!!",1
698, That was the most confusing movie ever but the best movie ever. It didnt make any sence until the end and I still cant figure out some of it. All I can say is Christopher Nolan (the writer and director) is A genius.,1
699," An amazing and significant breatthrough in the sci fi dream genre, finally capturing in a dazzling display of both visual and solid plot that illuminates the wonderful and haunting nature of dreams.",1
700, Wow. One of the most original movies I have seen in a long time. Awesome.,1
701, Wow! Nolan has made another masterpiece.,1
702," Metacritic scored this as a 74, but gave Avatar an 84. There is something clearly wrong with their system.",1
703," Inception has you leaving the theater with so many ideas and interpretations. in my opinion, if you find yourself wanting, or needing to see a movie for a second time in order to test your theories, that filmaker has done their job. Great movie, one of my all-time favorites.",1
704," Interesting science fiction movie that kind of devolves into an action movie. The movie requires a certain amount of attention and concentration, as it becomes a little convoluted. Much like Nolan's earlier work Memento, there are more than a few times when you are challenged to understand what is really happening and in which demension, and that challenge is kind of fun. There are a few wonderful visuals, most of which are early in the film, when we are being introduced to the conceptual framework of the cinematic universe, It is a entertaining, interesting movie, though it probably could have been so much more had the second half not become such a formulaic action movie.",1
705," One hell of an intellectual acid trip from start to finish. With the close-minded nature of many publications and audiences, it's no surprise they're absolutely baffled and inclined to bash it for not tailoring to them, the crowd who has been absorbing less-than-wholesome comedies and action movies for the last year (including the rather shallow, if fabulously striking, Avatar). Brains triumph over brawn when your eyes hit the screen, but the movie definitely does flex some muscle, with over-the-top, balls-to-the-walls set pieces that will leave you reeling. If you're going to watch Inception, remember to enter the theater with an open mind. Be ready to absorb a lot of plot points and track multiple parallel ""realities."" If you ready that other 90% of your brain for use, you will appreciate just what Nolan has achieved with this movie. First entertainment production in AGES that has blown my mind on principle instead of flash.",1
706, Fantastic. haven't seen anything matrix worthy in a while.,1
707, Awesome!,1
708," One of the best movies I've ever seen! More like this Hollywood, please.",1
709, This movie was absolute genius. The depth of the story was amazing . I love the idea of dreams with in dreams IN dreams. After spending more time when the movie was over to think about everything that happened it only gets better. It is definitely one of the greatest movies Ive ever seen.,1
711," Second time watching this, 1st time the only problems I had with it was the pacing towards the end and some bits I didn't understand. Now it's perfect.",1
713," This is one if not the best movie i have ever seen. i see some people have rated it 0 because it was way too complicated in which case i have to disagree completely this is one of the beauties of the movie; that is in fact plain simple nowadays i dont know why people have to come to idea that if something is explained with complicated words or just making far too hard to understand means that is brilliant ( matrix reloaded is my best example especifically the scene with the architect the use of extended words to describe something that couldve been explained in simpler lines would have saved me 2 more trips to cinema to finally understand it not that i dont like it brilliant movie aswell) inception relies in the simplicity of feelings, a rocky relationship between a father and a son and the love between leo dicaprio to his sons and to life itself, it teaches us how positive feeling will always overcome the negatives, how people always overate feelings when in fact every important decision that will mark us forever are the decisions based in these. awesome movie",1
714," Some of these naysayer reviews are ridiculous. Hello good friends, this is a work of fiction. If your mind doesn't have the capacity for imagination and creativity, this probably isn't the movie for you. The history channel would probably be a better use of your time. This movie is the best movie to hit the theaters in a LONG time. I was blown away, and half of the people I saw it with were watching it for the 2nd and 3rd time. Christopher Nolan films the movie brilliantly, and the actors in this were superb. Leo with an outstanding performance as usual. His characters make his movies so engaging. The only problem I had with one of the actors was the asian guy. I don't mean to be racist, but I couldn't understand what he was saying half the time. Maybe I'm deaf. Anyways I can't really explain how epic this movie is. It's pretty much extremely far-fetched plot wise so don't go expecting a believable movie like memento. Outstanding visuals, audio, actors, storytelling, it's all here. Go see it, you won't be disappointed (unless you're an engineering grad from an Ivy league school, I guess).",1
715, Christopher Nolan is Brilliant. Period.,1
716," Really trippy film, full of action, spectacular special effects, great storyline, great twists and a intense ending, massive build up then delivers. Over all it's different than anything else out there so if you want a change from the usual holywood blockbuster go see this it'll leave you thinking.",1
717," Firstly to Will W, it's palate and well done for misusing the word ""logic"". Despite it's minor lack of continuity it was a very good, well written film. Anyone who just spouts crap about minor inconsistancies without talking about the good aspects of Inception is bias, don't even give those idiots the time of day let alone your attention.",1
718," Amazing, great, and suspenseful movie that's impossible to predict what happens next, but kinda hard to follow everything that is going on.",1
719," Fantastic movie, one that you'll want to watch twice. If you're on the bubble as to whether to see it or not, *do it*, you won't regret it.",1
720," I need to watch it a third time. I still do not know who he is! (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. Yeah, I said when. You MUST see this unique movie.)",1
722," Highly enjoyable summer film, but ultimately not terribly imaginative or emotionally captivating to me. On the one hand, I love the ""form and function"" filmmaking skills of Nolan--he uses the editing of the film as much as the plot to tell the story, which is great. On the other hand, I could never really invest myself in any character, as I wasn't really given a reason to. Ultimately, I didn't care what happened to Tom Cobb, and the characters I did care more about weren't at all the focus of the narrative, although they were masqueraded to be. So, blah blah blah, it's a summer movie, I know, but I'm going to buy into that, then I will say outright that Terry Gilliam's Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus was the recent film that most captivated me emotionally and imaginatively, and that Inception is a great summer blockbuster, but not worthy of the ""best of the year"" title.",1
723," It is excellent, at times the layers of depth can drive you insane, but that only makes you appreciate the care that went into all of the details that made Inception's story engrossing and emotional, the film is always one step ahead and all the better for it. You undoubtedly will be very confused in the beginning, but like the Matrix, there is a tutorial scene when The Architect (as she's called in the ads) joins the group of Extractors (mega-dreamers).",1
725," Leo DiCaprio's character is in charge, but things are not as they seem. The story is not really about what it claims to be about. *Spoiler* It's about Dicaprio's character and his feelings of guilt regarding his dead wife, whose death he caused. Wait, am I writing about Inception or Shutter Island? In all that I've read about Inception, I can't believe I haven't seen any one mention that similarity between the two. I think Shutter Island was the better movie, more ominous. Maybe Scorsese is still a better director than Nolan? I love Memento and think highly of the rest of Nolan's work. I wanted to love Inception, but couldn't. It didn't move me. I cry a lot at movies...a lot! But not at the end of this one. I didn't care if he ever saw his children's faces. And then there is the mystery of the spinning top...does it fall or keep spinning...is he in reality or still in dreamland? Even here Shutter Island prevails with a similar question...is he back in his delusions or is he pretending because he wants the lobotomy to end his pain? Inception was not the movie I hoped it would be, but at least it gave me a greater appreciation for Shutter Island and makes me want to see Memento again!",1
726,"Ignore the time travel issues.  The tension and drama here are great, all while keeping the bigger puzzle in the frame as well.  I miss movies with this level of excitement.",1
728,"There is no arguing the grandiose nature of Inception, in its presentation, its ambition and its cinematic soul. The latest product of master craftsman Christopher Nolan, this Leo DiCaprio-starring heist thriller looks to go further down the rabbit hole than any film that's come before it... and then to press on even further. A kaleidoscopic tale of dreamscapes and nightmares, Inception sucks you in with its familiarity - luring you into the umpteenth film about dreams and mind exploration - then carries you away into uncharted realms of fantasy and science, smacking you in the face with rules and understandings with a casual banality, only in the very next moment to smack you again and tell you all that was only half true. Indeed, watching Inception is very much akin to dreaming itself, with all the wonders of introspection, complication and sloppiness with which dreams may come.

729,"Firstly, The MetaScore SHOULD be 78 after I have Calculated the average 5 times and getting the same results.Another phenomenal film by the great Christopher Nolan! It is VERY original for the film industry and it is just thrilling and unpredictable all the wayThis film deserves SEVERAL Academy Award nominations and Nolan deserves to FINALLY winning one after not winning on for Memento and not even being nominated for The Dark Knight (this had really disappointed me that year). This is probably one of the best films of the decade!",1
730,"Man gets secrets & ideas by entering people's dreams, on the run, given chance to be free if he does one last job, agrees, not everything so straight forward.Brilliant film in pretty much every aspect with a superb cast (Tom Hardy & Joseph Gordon-Levitt were the standouts for me), great script, fantastic action sequences & some great music to back it up.It has a real potential for getting messy & confusing but never thought it got too muddled despite all the dream shenanigans going on.",1
731,"awesome movie. a mind blowing script. and the screenplay of course, taking into the dream world. seeing curvy buildings, zero gravity etc. nolan""s dream world has been narrated well. the direction and lead casts performances are picture perfect. cinematography and visual effects are the stunning parts of the movie. the effects like water gushing , bridge setups and mirror mazes. some effects like the limbo state where dreams are constructed and buildings look exactly like a dream land. this is awesome. art work is terrific here. action scenes are novel and unique. the excitement never goes down. the climax is interesting. watch it now!!",1
732,It's a typical movie of Chris Nolan. All of his movies really get you to think and its no different with Inception. Its a very well thought out movie and one of the best of the year. Theres no reason for not seeing this movie.,1
734,"Inception slips into the filing cabinet of 'films that get you thinking' and if there had to be a sub category it would be 'unique' or 'moving'. Forget all the claims that it's complex and needs more than your average amount of attention, because the narrative is easy to grasp, it's the dreams within a dream that will get you fidgeting a little in your seat to keep up. I have never seen nor am aware of a film that explores this theme of dreams, I mean you have films with flashbacks occurring at the same time as the current narrative, but this is different. It echoes the importance and dangers of memories, and allows you to appreciate just how simple the structure of our world is.The dark side of this film is once again influenced by the directing of Christopher Nolan, who made Gotham City appear a softer version of hell in The Dark Knight. There are plenty of gun fights, fist fights, and stabbings in Inception, and I certainly admire any film that has a deeper layer that it manages to hide from it's viewers throughout the release of it's trailers. You could try and predict what happens in this film, but I highly doubt you would get more than fifty percent. You may become fearful at how much information you have to take in just in the first couple of scenes, but the story is unravelled slowly, difficult terms described and you will become hooked on knowing Dom Cobb's (Leonardo DiCaprio) big secret.The architectural genius behind the dreams is Ariadne, played by Ellen Page who has come a long way since her Juno days. Whilst everything seems so difficult to come to terms with, this character is the one you will probably look to for an explanation, and don't worry, she does enough digging in Cobb's life to give you the answers. But back to architecture, and words can't physically depict how astonishing and realistic the cinematography is. It's as though it could be possible to have the street underneath your feet as your sky at the same time. As a regular student, Ariadne becomes almost addicted to the dream worlds she creates, and without any persuasion becomes a valuable member of the team until the very end.Other faces you may recognise are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who starred as the main character in 500 Days of Summer, a very different role, and Tom Hardy who has starred in Bronson and RocknRolla. Marion Cotillard who plays Cobb's wife Mal may have stunning looks but has a fearsome temper behind those big eyes. As soon as you think you are watching an emotional situation, it is as though your mind has tricked you and it soon becomes violent and psychologically thrilling. The reason I felt grateful for what I have in life will hopefully effect you too by the end of the film as we are dragged through a variety of emotions but swiftly brought back down to rest our feet upon the ground.The fighting, explosions and slow motion were all elements I adored because they felt so unique and frustrating. Never have I been in such suspense watching a van fall from a bridge into a river which took about half an hour in real time. The visual technique of this film is more impressive than the 3D experience itself. If it was possible to see this in 3D I would have sat there with a dropped jaw for two hours, but honestly the CGI is remarkable and so finely detailed.It was worth the hype, and if you're worried it's too complicated, don't be. When I said I wasn't eager to see it again, I was lying. When's the next showing?!",1
735,"The only big-budget Hollywood movie that I've seen that felt like a piece of art. I dare say that Inception feels European at times, and then starts feeling like a mash-up art house action movie. The story demands your brain cells getting into gear and think, something that Hollywood loves to ignore. However, the audience seems to have caught up with the times and they realise they want more movies that ate just as we'll made as this masterpiece, and not a sequel to robots bashing each other senselessly. Christopher Nolan has brought new ground to Hollywood and has proven that the lowest common denominators are not as dumb as you think. Inception is a triumph of cinema, scifi storytelling and just overall realisation of a concept that isn't all that easy to translate on screen. 10/10",1
737,"I can tell that I was sceptically with the synopsis and direction, but the cast was very interesting and their performance, stunts and script didn't disappointed me. I caught this from the movie: In a dream, you can be the center of your own universe but there are many black holes that can trap you and keep you away from the ""reality"" to stay and live in your own world without noticing the irreality. People who was in comma can support the notion.The simple idea of traveling from dream to a deeper dream can be absurd, but many people has ""dreamed"" themselves ""dreaming"", which Nolan used to makes us think about the life and the next step after death. I can recommend it.Greetings.",1
738,"I have to say, one of the best movies I've ever seen (tied with the Lord of the Rings and the Dark Knight, another Christopher Nolan film). You can just look at the title and say: that's a good movie. It'll get high ratings. So far I've been correct: Fred Clause will be panned by critics, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will be terrible, and Inception will be AWESOME! Director Christopher Nolan created a universe that, in some senses may not be original, and then wrote a story involving the characters in the universe. I liked how he developed the universe to have complex laws and rules. I also liked all the psychology behind it, such as Dom Cobb and his deceased wife, Mal. The psychology was so immense, yet it managed to hold our attention until the end. Another great thing about Chris Nolan, he can handle so many characters at once. You should see the posters for Inception and The Dark Knight. There are like ten actors across the top and those aren't even all the main characters. In Inception, Nolan made sure all the main characters were developed and when you finish the film, you can't help but know the characters, especially Dom, Fischer, and Ariadne. Some pretty good action scenes too. I really liked the twist at the end. All I can say now is woohoo! 10 of 10.",1
739,"www.noisypictures.co.uk ",1
740,"Inception is simply mind-blowing. For the ones who have a close mind, it would be that way, and by the negatives reviews I can see why. This movie was breathtaking.",1
741,"Yes, the snow sequence goes on too long and is too faux-Bond but the film is tightly plotted and exciting in the extreme. Not to mention the brilliant effects that though show-offy are integral to the story. Seeing this a second time made me appreciate it even more so.",1

743,"Why is it that when a movie is above average, which this one certainly is, people (critics in particular) fall all over themselves to praise it?  Why is it that when a movie is hard to explain, and even harder to understand, people immediately think they are brilliant if they sit through it and then leave the theatre thinking...""Whoa...that was some heavy s**t.""   Trust me.  You are still far from ever being a candidate for Mensa if you ""love"" this movie.  I did not ""love"" it.  I did, however, enjoy it and would recommend it for people that want to, as another reviewer wrote here, have a ""good mind f**k.""  You just have to be in the right frame of mind, either naturally or herbally induced.  While the movie is overrated, it is also very good, paricularly from a visual/special effects standpoint.   The idea of the story is also very intriguing, but totally unbelieveable.  I love a good science fiction film as much as the next person, but enjoy them more when they are somewhere within the grasp of reality.  This one fell way outside the box for me in that category.  I didn't agree with the lead casting.  While they are both good actors, Leo (even with facial hair) and Joseph look too young to be the characters they portray here.  I know.  I know.  By now you would think I could accept DiCaprio in more mature roles, but definitely had a hard time with him here.   I am a big fan of Chris Nolan, but let's face it, not every movie can be a home run.  Despite the word on the street, this one is a double (or triple at best) and that is certainly not a bad thing.  It just isn't the ""classic"" many are making it out to be.  BTW, with regards to the ending being real or a dream?  I didn't really care and that is the true test for me.  The film was too full of gimmicks, exotic locales and ""what if"" scenarios to keep me interested to that degree.  In the end, it is just a movie, albeit a good one...but far from great.",1
744,"Often when I watch a film I’m often taken out if it by major issues I have with the film from characters and story but this isn’t the case. Every problem I have with this film is minor and/or can easily be overlooked. The film has an original concept that leads to some fantastic action scenes and an amazing climax. Leonardo DiCapprio embodies the character he plays to the point when I’m not thinking to myself that’s Leonardo DiCapprio that’s the Inception character. The score and direction are great. Most of the characters don’t have much too them and the score is a little too much like Dark Knight and is overshadowed by the wakeup music but those are issues that I can easily overlook. It is rare that I can just sitback and enjoy a film without thinking of critiques, the score I’ll give it, etc because Inception has microscopic problems. This film is awesome it blew me away and truly ranks as not just a great film for Nolan to add to his resume but one of the greatest films out there. I loved watching this movie and I can’t wait to see it again. With more and more viewings this could become one of my favorite movies. With Nolan having a film this awesome under his belt I cannot wait for Interstellar because films like this prove how awesome of a filmmaker he is. Then again with Nolan setting the bar so why the question is raised how do you top that. Regardless Inception is amazing brilliant concept, brilliant direction, brilliant acting. See this film if you haven’t already.",1
745,This is a great movies for fans of classic movies and people who like the modern movies this idea is very orginal but has some insiperations of movies in the past and the action scenes were great! while telling the story in the same time whitch i havnt seen in much movies these days the only thing that holds inception back from a perfect 10 is that i was entering the theather kinda scared that i may not get it but to be honest i got it perfectly but in the beggning i was sorta lost but i got right back to it so my anticipations were differnet but the ending was defintly not predictable i did not see it coming so everyone who is a fan of any kind of geners of movies will love this movie,1
747,"Very dynamic, VERY GOOD! Leonardo and Ellen were great. I have nothing else to say so bravo to the people who made this movie and it was very very very very very very very good!",1
749,**** the media **** the haters **** everybody who dont like this movie because this is the most fresh and innovating movie ever. This is a 10 should be an 11 but since most of the populace are ****ing retards then here i got something for ya **** YOU haha,1

752,"This film does not need any more reviews, but I wanted a vote. It's awesome, clean, polished, intelligent, exciting, Deserves film of the year. Best film in last 3 years,",1
753,"Chris Nolan is my favorite director, and this may be his best work to date.  Inception is executed so brilliantly in so many areas that if you are like me, you mouth was open through half the movie.  When you think of Nolans last two movies, neither The Dark Knight or Inception had one scene that was wasted or didn't move the plot forward.  Keeping in mind that they are both 2hr 30mins, it's quite an impressive feat.  The last thing I want is a movie where I say to myself ""why was that scene included?"".  Nolan really knows what he is doing at all times, and best of all he trusts that the viewer is keeping up with the story just as well as he is.  It's about time Nolan gets a Best Director nod.",1
754,"Christopher Nolan made the first script for this back in 2001. Now, nearly ten years and two brilliant Gotham-set movies, it is released. The question is, is Inception any good? In short, YES! Inception is a serious contendor for film of the year. It is the rare movie that makes you think, whilst entertaining you with brilliant visuals. All of the cast play their role brilliantly, not one actor wavering throughout. The highlights have to be Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, playing their roles with such whim whilst venturing through serious situations. I heard this film be described as Ocean's Eleven meets The Matrix. It certainly is, as the first part plays out with the group recruiting and planning, ala Oceans, with each character playing a certain role. The second part than plays out as The Matrix, with the characters venturing through worlds which aren't real to set out their goal. The gravityless fight scene is a sight to behold, a high point of the movie. During the mind sequences, when met by the enemy, you fear for the characters fates. It is at this moment that I realised something. These characters aren't heroes. They're anti-heroes. Their mission is to trick a company heir into dissolving his fathers company, for Sato's personal gain. But we don't care about that, we care for these characters. From that, Christopher Nolan proves he is talented with writing characters, let alone movies. All in all, this movie is an event. It will make you think, and entertain you with it's awesomeness. This film is a must-see",1
755,I have seen and loved every one of Nolanâ,1
756,"Now I could go on for ages about this film, thats why I'll keep it brief. No brief overview from me (storyline if you will), you'll have to find that out for yourself. Since films began way back in the late 1920's there has been many classics, such as, Gone With The Wind, Casablanca, The Sound Of Music, The Great Escape, The Godfather, and Shawshank Redemption, to name a few. And rightly so they all deserve there praise and plaudits galore. But after seeing this film now five times, twice in the cinema and three on dvd, many will agree this is cinema redefined. Christopher Nolan is quite new to some people, but what he has done here is taken the money Warner Bros. have given him for the two Batman films he made and he has created something quite extraodrinary. Its a complicated film which for some may be quite long and boring, but for most its most incredible 144 minutes ever in the history of cinema. Thats why I've given Inception this bold remark, THE GREATEST FILM ACHIEVEMENT IN ALL HISTORY!!! My ratings in whatever format; 5/5, 10/10, 100%/100%, *****!!!",1
758,"Christopher Nolan has definitely developed one of the most intriguing and original ideas in Hollywood ever. The only issue here is that Nolan holds on to that simple idea too much, of stealing people's secrets by going into their dreams. The idea is then transformed into amazing and spectacular special effects, but also having too much going on and not introducing them at the appropriate times. As well as an inconsistent flow of what scenes are slowed down, when they should be accelerating into a thrilling moment. And the direct opposite. By the end of the film, it seems that Nolan's intent is unclear and should be shown again to become clearer. Despite the flaws, the main reason that this film is good is due to Nolan's original idea and the cast line-up. Every cast member is notable and all delivering a decent performance. But it seems to much for a film and too much of a great idea, that it seems great when seeing several shots in a trailer, but doesn't execute well in a theater.",1
759,"I can give this movie no more then a full 10. I went to this movie only hearing that it was Chris Nolan behind it. I loved both Batman movies, so i thought that this would be just as well, but boy was i wrong. This was a masterpiece compared to TDK. TDK was good, but this was just out of the league. It was exactly the kind of movie i liked. Dropping out clues throughout the movie, only to make them fit as a pussle in the end. And the scoreline is so beautiful too, i went home and straight on to Spotify to look for the soundtrack. And i remember a scene from the end of the movie, and listened to that scenes score, and it gave me the chills.",1
760,"This movie is probably ""The Movie"" of 2010. By that I mean it is perfect to see with friends, family, coworkers, whatever you want. The second thing that makes this ""The Movie"" is that it's filled with action (actionful?) and it has a plot. Not very many movies can do that nowadays. Awesome story, Awesome Action, Awesome ending, Awesome directing, Awesome acting, Awesome movie.",1
761,"7.4/10? Really? Movie critics needs to learn how to do their job. This is by far the most charming, well-filmed and acted and lets not forget, most mind-blowing movie I've seen in a while. It makes you think about life. It borrows from The Matrix but I enjoyed it just as much as I did with Matrix. Granted there are unrealistic moments (eg. the technology of going into a dream which feels so real you get confused) and sure there might even be a few plot holes and bad logic but hey, sci-fi films are where imagination is at its best, we watch movies not to pick on the plot holes but to get entertained and Inception surely is the as entertaining as movies can get. I'll admit i didn't get some parts of the movie when I watched it the first time, but after a second run, everything became clear, You have to watch it twice. Movie of the year. Easily 10 out of 10. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it may lead to a rise in suicide rates because it indirectly promotes suicide.",1
762,"Inception is definitely one of the best movies of the year. I don't understand how some of you can say that this movie is bad, or boring. Chris Nolan did a great job with this and he definitely should be awarded with an Academy Award.",1
764,"I absolutely LOVE inception! The first time i watched it, I found it kind of hard to understand but i still loved it. Now that I fully understand  it I love it even more! The plot is just amazing, it never ceases to surprise me and the cast was brilliant. This movie really grabbed me and is definitely one of my all-time favorites.",1
765,"Inception is a great movie, saw it three times in theatres and never get tired of it. The dream sequences are memorable and the movie keeps you thinking, the acting is great, cast is awesome (Page, DiCaprio, Cotillard, and Levett) The story is just amazing. If you havent seen it yet...you probably dont like movies.",1
766,"Inception has a good Syfy idea at its central core basically derived from Roger Zelazny's idea in Dream Master. As the Amazon review summarizes...""His name is Charles Render, and he is a psychoanalyst, and a mechanic of dreams. A Shaper. In a warm womb of metal, his patients dream their neuroses, while Render, intricately connected to their brains, dreams with them, makes delicate adjustments, and ultimately explains and heals.""Too much shoot em up action for the box office dollars but I still enjoyed it  enough to give it a 7.",1

768,"How can people NOT like this movie?! It was one of the greatest movies I've seen in a long time. Those of you who say the plot line is hard to follow are just, not to be rude, but dumb. It was easy to figure out, and the concept of the movie was mind-blowing.",1
770,"Inception is a thriller in the style of Memento and The Prestige, but even smarter. I've seen this film up to 10 times and every time I discovered something new because the content and the story are so rich and well constructed and the action and the mind-blowing special effects just make the film an ultimate discovering. Why is it so exiting? Because the power unleashed by the dreamer's mind is that big and at the same time uncontrollable, that it has to be exiting. DiCaprio delivers a solid performance while trying to keep control over his imagination and Nolan appeals to the audience to know whether a logic interpretation of life can/should be given.",1
771,"A sci-fi heist film with a unique concept that allows it to be more complex and artistically inclined than most other blockbusters while still delivering the same kind of thrills. The premise of people entering other's dreams and stealing information from their memories while they're asleep could have turned Inception into a dorky, more niche bit of science-fiction, but in Christopher Nolan's capable hands it is executed with depth and intelligence in areas that it could have been much schlockier.On top of having flashy action and mind-bending set pieces all brought to life by Nolan's always excellent visuals and cinematography, the film has a lot of heart and soul as well thanks to it's protagonist's quest for redemption and struggle with regret. The way the plot handles memories, the subconscious, and our perceptions of reality are pretty brilliant and engages the viewer mentally rather than solely letting them gawk at the spectacle of the characters duking it out with their target's subconscious projections while the dream world around them literally turns upside-down.I'm surprised to say that I do have some complaints with the acting. I found Leonardo DiCaprio to be a little wooden and Marion Cotillard's performance as a mentally unstable person felt forced. Everyone else is fine, although their characters aren't always given that much to do. The standout of the cast is Tom Hardy who was a real scene stealer.I can't praise Nolan enough for creating this high-octane action movie that he took the time to give a real brain to. The pace never lets up so there's a constant sense of forward movement. The emotional effectiveness of some scenes and themes is somewhat lessened thanks to some disappointing acting, but overall we are still able to sympathize with the lead thanks to the poignancy of the writing itself. Inception is a mind-blowing ride from one of the most talented director's currently working and is well worth watching. A stunning example of what can become of action films when supported by a strong mental backbone.",1
772,"Pure awesomeness, though more character development and more acting depth wouldn't hurt.",1
773,"Inception hits the usual Christopher Nolan standard with it's high concepts, ambition, great acting and originality. The film has so many memorable scenes with quite a few scares and a lot of heart thrown in along the way. Inception is top entertainment and should not be missed.",1
774,"How far can one man push the limits of filmmaking? What Christopher Nolan creates here is brillantly original and staggering; a masterpiece composed of complex ideas, logical arrangements, mind-blowing effects, 'Memento'-like sequences, stellar control, and a premise that can only be dreamt of. ""Inception"" is one of those seldom cinematic pieces that keeps you scratching your head and feeding on your brain throughout, after, and even after-after that. The only complaint, hence a 7 instead of a 10, is not of anything of this film, but those of Hollywood who are so dumbed-down that this blockbuster hit, comparably, has the viewer feeling like a character out of ""Idiocracy; at times a bit TOO much to absorb. If grading substance alone over enjoyment, the film is in a class of itself. As metaphysical as it plays, however, the casual moviegoer will be lost within minutes of ""Inception."" The film demands your full attention, not even a look down to your popcorn can be had in this one. Get ready to think, and think, and think: am I even thinking right now? That's what you can expect---but honestly, shouldn't a film convey such cephal-activity?",1
775,"This film didn't take me by surprise by how awesome it was. When I first saw the trailer for it I knew it would be another great Nolan film. Absolutely, 100% original, the most original film of the year, maybe the decade (yeah, I'll say it). As far as acting and performance value, no one steals the show, but every character is at least a bit intriguing. Incredible visuals and score. The intensity and edge of your seat suspense doesn't end for an entire hour of the film. The screenplay is wonderful. At times, it moves a bit too fast, but with an idea this complex it kind of had to move fast. Astounding direction from Christopher Nolan. As far as entertainment goes, if they can give us better than this, I would love to see it.",1
776,AMAZING MOVIE!! This movie is one of the best movie's I've ever seen. It requires quick thinking and you must have a good attention span. Also if you're looking for a movie with just action and no story look somewhere else. Movies like this have an amazing story but they're not made for mindless action. If you're going to complain that it was boring then you cannot handle a very intelligent movie like this one.Amazing movie go out and watch it now!,1
777,best nolans work so far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
779,"I think Nolan showed his director skills in movies like Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight but he overcomes himself with this movie, Inception is a movie that no-one knew how it was going to develop, and the way it does shows his great work (not leaving behind the fine performances of the actors). The way he plays with the mind of the viewers with such an impressive script shows that he is one of the best directors of the decade",1
780,"Simply an amazing movie. From its state of the art special effects to its captivating story line, this movie is one you can't miss. After watching this movie I felt a sense of fullness, this movie truly gives you the full movie going experience",1
781,"An Idea. A single idea from the human mind can do anything. That is what Christopher Nolan (Director) wants to resuscitate us. I am amazed by Nolan who could always tell such a complicated story so smooth. He has already proved his capability on his previous works, such as: BATMAN BEGINS (2005), THE DARK KNIGHT (2008), and sophisticated magician tale in THE PRESTIGE(2006). But I prefer to compare thiz one with his earlier masterpiece MEMENTO (2000). What he was good at, not just a great story-teller (I think he is the best in our generation) but he always made a brilliant twist and turn in every ending of his stories. INCEPTION contains multi layer story-telling which tremendously executed well, precise what we saw on MEMENTO. INCEPTION is simply a bigger scale of MEMENTO. The story tells how Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team could invade to people minds through their dream, and Cobb job is to steal it, or plant a new one. The supporting Casts were amazing, fills with the heavy-caliber Actors such as: Michael Caine, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Ken Watanabe and others. In my notes, Dicaprio was not better than his performance on SHUTTER ISLAND (2010, early thiz year), but definitely also not a bad one either. Once again, he is success with his script selections and delivers some constant performances. Ellen Page and Cillian Murphy, both of them had just showed their extraordinary performances on **** (2010). I have to say Murphy brings one of the best performances for overall. But the best appearance is belongs to Marion Cottilard as Cobb vulnerable wife. The side-story about the dark past of Cobb and his wife draws my attention. The chemistry and that background story were one of the interesting parts from thiz movie. I could easily say, The Folding City and Revolving Room scenes will be one of the memorable moments in cinematic history. Thiz time, Nolan takes us to his dream, where an idea becomes seed of possibility. A great opening, a nice built concept for the main plot and deceitful twist of ending, it is all we needed for new level of ingenious movie.

783,"An action story is the means for the movie's real question: is our world real or is it a dream? The danger this idea can create is that people might commit suicide more easily, expecting they will then wake up in the real world. But really, does it matter if our world is real or only a product of our fantasy? If the dream is a paradise compared to the real world (as it also is in the Matrix trilogy) why bother about reality? Why would anyone want to live in a worse world just because it is ""real""? In fact, philosophical scepticism claims that our senses are not reliable and therefore cannot tell what is real anyway. Therefore, the only thing I can be certain of is that I am because I am able to think, and rational thinking does not require my senses. However, the protagonists of Inception (as well as in The Matrix) do strive for the ""real"" world, which keeps the whole movie going, leading to that one last point, when they think they are in the real world again. This movie is just an introduction to lucid dreaming and only tangents philosophy, but it is definitely worth watching.",1
784,"It's a good film. It's not the best film though as so many people insist on telling me. Once you get the point of the film you realise that it's a 'dream within a dream within a dream' I don't know why people found that so hard to understand. I got to grips with the plot easily. Still though an enjoyable enough film and the score by Hans Zimmer was something else. I now believe that if someone shouted ""BBBRRRRMMM"" you'd know exactly what they were on about. Great music.",1
786,"This film is an intellectual triller that shows that American cinema can be dominated by a movie that is not all about sex, drugs and violence( like Black Swan.)",1

789,"It's simply a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan is a genius and both Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are brilliant actors. And let's not forget about Ellen Page, a very mature acting performance. Inception should be considered as one of the best movies of all time. It has splendid technical qualities and breathtaking action scenes. The screenplay was nearly flawless. I witnessed many people discussing the ending of the film for hours, which means this movie does not only make you enjoy it, but forces you to run your brain harder and think deeper. Not too many movies will make you think these days, The Social Network for example. You just watch it and never have the need to think about what's going on or making a connection between events. In fact, for these kind of movies, you do not have to use your brain at all. A 5 year-old could have the same impression for the movie with you. That's why Inception is an extraordinary movie. If you did not watch it, please do. You won't regret it.",1

793,"A message to low scorers of this movie who find the high scores difficult to grasp. A terrible or poor movie cannot score high among so many individuals and critics. Bad movies always get generally low scores. This is the wonder of having many people take part in scoring including critics who do this as a career. It is highly illogical that everyone was ""fooled"" into believing it is a good movie. The more feasible explanation is that you did not understand the movie and could not associate with the conceptual brilliance. Personally I am very critical of movies and this movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Period.",1
794,"I just watched this film for the second time, and I can honestly say I enjoyed it more than the first.  Not to say I didn't enjoy it the first time around.  It's just that watching it for a second time I could follow everything that was going on, and hence I felt a lot more engaged in the story.  This really is a brilliant film that challenges the notions of space and time, reality and dreams, and truth and ideas.  And it does it in an action-packed way. The dream sequences (which make up more than half the film) are also very beautiful to look at.  It reminds me a little of David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"", which also polarised critics, and also took a couple of viewings to fully grasp.  However Inception may be a little more accessible with its more familiar cast.  I wish there were more films like this, that get you thinking, instead of the dumbed down fare we mostly get out of Hollywood.  We know that films like this can be made, but its more often about box-office takings these days, and beautiful people.  Thankfully films like this have a high replay value.",1
796,"Okay the film is brilliant, that's all I have to say about that. Now in a linear thought process I will try to explain what happened. 1. Cobb lived with his family in the U.S. He and Mal explored the dreamworld all the way down to limbo. In limbo, Mal came to the belief that limbo was reality. Cobb, after finding Mal's hidden spinning top (her totem) knows for certain that limbo is not reality and has grown weary with living in limbo. He convinces Mal to take ""a leap of faith with him"" saying that limbo is not reality and the only way to escape it and return to the real world is to kill themselves. Mal goes along with it and they place their heads on the railroad track. 2. Mal is not permanently convinced that the real world is real though and she still longs for limbo; which for her, is her real world. She writes a note making it seem that Cobb had killed her and she wrote it to a lawyer in order to make it seem that Cobb murdered her. She believes in this way Cobb will rather take his life along with her than stay in the real world, which she believes is fake. Cobb knows otherwise and does not jump with her. After Malâ",1
797,"Hello. If by any chance what so ever you hated this movie then you should probably reread this at list a couple times. Inception is by far the best freaking movie of the decade. just as the decade has ended.whenever I see someone who doesn't like this movie is because they just don't understand it at all. Then they get all mad and just makes fun of it any way that they can like, '' it was a waste of time or money.'' well let me just tell you that there was plenty of action  and actually a few funny  parts in it as well( definitely more then the dark knight.). It was the '' total package '' and it is a movie that I think everyone on the planet should see it to just notice that nolan made it all by himself. The whole dream fiasco, the whole idea of it is incredible and that it doesn't just blow still amazes me to this very day. And we all had a decent dream once, right? Can't we just love Inception and get along?",1
798,"This film is an exceptional blockbuster, with heart-pounding music, a brilliant stroyline, great acting and stunning visual effects. The concept of dreams is cleverly interwined with memories and personal experience, adding a sub story to the main 'inception' mission.",1
799,this is the best movie ive ever watched.Nolan brings out his writing and directing ability in this movie.its quite sad he wasn't nominated for best director. :(,1
800,"Inception has its weak points and its strengths. What makes Inception good is the fact that it explores a generally unexplored movie subject. The mind. Coupled with great action and acting this movie is a wonderful. The plot may be confusing and hard to follow, and by the end leaves you questions, however the movie does its best to convey the message of the film.",1
801,"Creative dream-sight -    In a modern present time confidential information can be planted inside the human brain and a man can communicate with his deceased wife. Dominic Cobb is a sharp minded extractionist who makes a living of a modern technological discovery. The main goal with this technology is to capture secret information from ordinary peoples minds, but the goal is rotated 180 degrees when Dominic receives an irresistible offer from a powerful Japanese, which involves inception. After the box office hit ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) my expectations were great when it was announced that Christopher Nolan was making a film with Leonardo DiCaprio, and he certainly delivers. ""Inception"" looks good on the big screen and lacks nothing when it comes to the films technological and aesthetic aspects. The films versatile acting ensemble engages with their energetic and well articulated interpretations. Marion Cotillard, Ken Watanabe and Cillian Murphy stands out, while Leonardo DiCaprio continues to prove why he is hired by masterful directors. ""Inception"" is 220 minutes like the speed of light with thriller, drama, comedy and action, that describes and visualizes the experience of being awake and in dreams at the same time. Nolan's dream-sight and level of creativity can be associated with ""The Matrix"" (1996) and ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001). Intellectual dialog, progressive editing, sublime architecture photography and a thought intensive screenplay are some of the strongest elements in this ingenious film.",1
802,"Inception is a great film but while I was watching this for the first time, I was saying to myself  ""What is going on here?"" I was saying that to myself the second time I say it as well. Still a great film though.",1
803,A pretty good idea. The movie seems to present a parallel universe which tends the reality. The special effects and the characterâ,1
804,"I can't believe someone actually said that the Matrix was better............  I must admit the first Matrix was awesome, but then by the next two sequels it went ""Hollywood"" I swear those fight scenes in Reloaded looked like Keanu Reeves was on ""Dancing with the stars""  It was like no one on the set even attempted to make the fight scenes look real. (It looked like really bad dance moves especially with the sountrack blazing in the background behind each fight scene)  Now Inception obviously came from a Hollywood that has become ""Matrixed"" out(And I'll give that much for the matrix trilogy, for setting a new standard) But Inception has a really great flow about it, its quite smooth in its distribution, Its like walking right into a dream that someone has created. The creators of this film obviously truly thought this film through, which today doesn't seem to happen much, the truth of this is that by the end of the film , you realize that they were the ""Architects"" and you were the patsy whose mind they've manipulated by a dream they've created.",1
805,"A mind-bending, intricately constructed film.  Nolan's surreal imagery, deeply layered story telling, and compelling visual style make this a must-see.  Top-notch acting, superb direction, and fantastic special effects.",1
806,"This is one of the best movies ive ever seen. if someone tells you its too confusing, then they were probably told the same thing and over thought it. it isnt hard to get. the acting is superb as is the writing, directing, and score, there is no words to describe what Nolan has done with the effects of this movie and the fact that he did as little of CGI as possible is commendable.  an instant classic, a must buy.",1
807,"This movie is one of the best movies I saw in 2010!It had very good actor's,one of the most intense action I have ever experienced,good dialog and the story was very well thought up.I literary after the movie started thinking that ""Am I in a dream?"".These are one of these movies I wanna see again or even buy it.",1
808,"Innovative and intelligent, Inception is both thoroughly and imaginatively written and visually breathtaking. Pros: Brilliantly written and directed, as expected from Christopher Nolan; breathtaking special effects; marvelous climax; outstanding performances. Cons: Inception is not just for looks, in fact, it may come off as ""boring"" to audiences less interested in its complex use of narration and dialog.",1
809,"Nolan's brainchild is the most original one-off we are likely to see in a long while; perfect in it's pin-point and unnerving defiance to pander to everyone's needs. As one door closes, another opens filled with mysteries for us to obsess about. This is a well-executed and obsessed over piece of work from a modern wizard of film. It often falls somewhere between the hyper-aware and unpredictable  'Vanilla Sky' and an excellent modern action/thriller with some great stoic appearances from Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy; their strong, yet under-developed characters fitting brilliantly within a half-remembered dream.",1
810,"This was, to say the least, a mind-blowing and fantastic movie. I hate to say it but anyone who gave this a negative score should really think about watching it again, because you really need to be smart to understand it fully and should probably watch it at least three times, because after that the story and dialog become crystal clear and it becomes much more clear overall. You can't just go in and think you'll be able to watch it like some mindless action movie, because this is so much more than that. I for one enjoyed it the first time I watched it a lot and it got better each time I watched it, so for even those who didn't like it because they thought the characters were shallow and the plot was bad because they didn't understand it, give it a second chance, you'll find a marvel of a movie. Better written than most movies ever made including The Dark Knight.",1
811,"I thought it over like fifty times, but it just cannot be any different than a ten (10). First time I watched it in cinema, I was a little bit baffled or misoriented. However after getting the DVD I watch it once a week I think. I just can`t get over this flick! Where do I start - maybe from the best. First off, performance worth of an Oscar by Leonardo DiCaprio, excellent acting by Marion Cotillard and Ken Watanabe, above average by all the rest, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. All of the characters without exceptions are engaging in their own way. Each of them contribute to make the viewer experience something special. There are couple of wonderful scenes here which I view from time to time just out of boredom. There are all kinds of emotions I especially appreciate. Second, the music. I just can`t get it out of my head. It succeeds wonderfully in both assisting the action scenes and dramatic ones. It perfectly manipulates the viewer without him noticing. Third being the story. It is just brilliant. Somehow Christopher Nolan managed to make an action-thriller-drama film in one without going overboard. The love story is there - it doesn`t get in the way, it is touching. The action scenes are ok, without no needless effects. The chain of events is overall well thought. The idea of dream in a dream has been executed with excellence. The viewer experiences all kinds of emotions : fear, sorrow, intrigue, happiness, doubt. I didn`t find a single hole in the story. Everythin with a cliffhanger scene and a never-know end to it. Easily one of my 20 all time best movies ever made. Perfect.",1
812,This is a very good film. Great concept. I liked Leonardo Dicaprio. There was amazing cinematography. You also have a great story. You will like this movie. Trust me.,1
813,"@loriG , you said that the movie had holes in the plot! but then you said you kept falling asleep! next time you write a review, make sure you stay awake!! and wacht the movie, ok?? aniways the movie was pretty original, and it makes you think, wich is why this movie is for smart people!! if you didnt like it, its because you didnt get it!!",1

815,"If you want to be spellbounded by a complex and riveting spectacle than you've found your naker because this film displayed wonderful special effects and moving perfomances! It challenges the intellectual to think out side of the box and takes a few watches to understand completed. Evidently, Christopher Nolan breathed life into a well-crafted wonder that diserves all the critical acclaim the world has described!",1
816,"One word: Masterpiece!!! Christopher Nolan once again serves up another action blockbuster and if truth be told its possibly the best film of 2010. Nolan gets it spot on in almost every sense, visually its just mesmerizing, it is an awesome achievement to do what Nolan does in this film. The characters are engaging from the very beginning and immediately draws you into the world of Inception, leaving you pondering what is dream and what is reality. The idea itself is intriguing and in a film you would doubt it would work but this is sublime film-making. Di Caprio is as grand as ever in the lead role but the star of the show is Tom Hardy, who brings a more light-hearted and ironic approach aboard he seems destined for big things. And a mention for the beautiful Marion Cotillard who is terrific as Cobb's wife lost in limbo. This is without doubt one of the boldest and bravest films ever made and for that reason it's certainly one of the best films of all time!",1
818,This is the best movie I have seen in awhile. The characters are engadgeing and you end up careing for them and feeling the plight. The ending is ambigious as the scene cus before in order for the viewer to determine. Great movie.,1
819,"Inception is one of those films that captures your mind from the beginning. Some might say its a hard movie to understand, but that only makes it better. When you combine great acting, great directing, and superb music, you get Inception.",1
820,"I don't understand how this film can have a Metascore of 74 when so many ignored critics are giving this film full marks. What do I think? It's fantastic. The acting is perfect, blending high-grade celebrities with lesser-known but very good actors. The story is one of the film's greatest strengths, bringing together common themes and morals with a completely fresh, Matrix-y plot. The special effects are simply ground-breaking. They are so good, they are almost as much of a technological leap that (the aformentioned) The Matrix was. Any weak points? The story can be quite confusing sometimes, but it doesn't detract from the film's excellence ONE BIT. Everything in this film is judged perfectly. Miss this fantastic film and you will regret it forever.",1
821,"Christopher Nolan's Inception quite clearly is a masterpiece. Originally different, excitingly action-packed, and definitely fascinating, Inception is a film like no other. In order to understand the movie, you have to follow it, not just look at the screen and figure out what's happening. And that's the goods Nolan brings to the screen. He wants the audience to feel the movie, not see it. And I did connect. There's so much good stuff to this film. Let's start with the plot. Inception is about a team who go into people's dreams and steal ideas or similar things that you can access from the mind (security numbers, thoughts, etc.). But when one of their jobs fail, they flee. Just when they thought they would have to start new lives, they receive a job offer. Team leader Cobb (DiCaprio) and his right hand man, Arthur (Gordon-Levitt), are told by Saito (Watabe), that he has a proposition. He wants to incept an idea into someone's mind. Arthur believes it's impossible, but Cobb says it can be done. So they take the job, but they need a new team. So they go round the world and find an elite team: Ariadne (Page), the architect, Eames (Hardy), the forger, and Yusuf (Rao),  the chemist. And after weeks and weeks of planning, dreams, and secrets, they commence their plot. But once they enter the dream, not all goes according to plan... So, truly, the plot is brilliant. Full of action, drama, and emotion, Nolan wrote one fantastic script. Then comes the acting. Surprisingly well done, the whole cast acted every one of their roles to the fullest. 'Nuff said. Then the 4 Oscars they received were worthy. Cinematography:excellent. Sound:excellent. Sound editing:excellent. Visual effects:outstanding! This is the film with the best visual effects since Avatar, and Avatar had the best visual effects since, well, anything! The collapsing of the buildings, the movement of the floor turning into a wall, all looked so freakin REAL! Now, I move on to Nolan. He was robbed of a nomination from the academy, and that's just wrong. Other critics can definitely tell you the same thing. His endless work on this film was so giving to the audience, and worth aol the money he rolled in from it. He's one of the best directors out there, up with James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino, and Clint Eastwood. Everything he does turns to gold (or at least in Hollywood). Can I stretch it enough? No. But It would take as many reviews as you can read to stretch it ""enough"". Now, to the final part that made this film great. The message. This film has such an emotional feel through out. Cobb and his wife are loving people. But little does the audience know, what truly happened until the end. This causes Cobb to flee from his friends, family, and children. The last glimpses he has of them are there backsides playing in the sand. All Cobb now wants is to go back to his family and see them, one last time. And in the end, when he sees them, he leaves his totem spinning. He doesn't care if he's in dreamer not anymore. As long as he gets to be with his children. He just needs his family. The message sent is all that matters, In any circumstances, is family. And despite all the dreams in the film, that's more reality than anything. 10/10",1
822,"Superb! One of the finest films ever made! Regardless of all the theories on story originality, this film is a masterpiece nonetheless. DiCaprio gives an excellent performance supported by an awesome cast! This picture is beautifully filmed and scored, and it accomplished what so many films fail to do these days......it brought people to the theatres!",1
823,"It's not a perfect movie, because I don't think we will ever get a perfect movie, but Nolan's latest work combines a complex, intriguing idea with a personal story and huge action scenes. The acting, particularly from Di Caprio - who has matured a significant amount since Titanic as an actor -, Hardy - who never fails to put in a strong performance - and Murphy, was consistently good. The plot is cleverly written and keeps you glued to your screen, and finally the ambiguous ending is a good move by Nolan as it means the film is open to individual interpretation. Combine this with brilliant music and visuals and you have Inception.",1
824,"Writer/Director of the most recent Batman Trilogy Christopher Nolan inception follows Dom Cobb (Di Caprio) who is able to invade people's dreams and extract their most closely guarded secrets. An international fugitive Cobb is given an opportunity to wipe his past clean by a shady businessman if he can plant an idea into a marks head; of course this job is not without its risks. Featuring a stellar cast Inception could have been a complete disaster in the hands of a less capable director. The way in which Nolan utilizes astounding visual effects to continually add deeper and deeper layers to the concept without making everything too difficult to follow is truly masterful however and makes for one of the most spectacular films ever to grace cinema screens. To say anymore would be to spoil the movie for those that haven’t seen and suffice to say you should certainly see it.",1
825,its difficult to understand this movie the first time you watch it.   it blew me away.  it was great to see an original movie for once.  it was confusing.  and you kept saying wow and what the **** the whole timne when you watch this movie.  overall i liked it,1
826,"While the visuals and the general idea of the plot are unique and brilliant, the execution left LOADS to be desired. The characters (with the exception of DiCaprio's) have almost no personality and I found it impossible to connect to anyone. Both Paige and Gordon-Levitt were one dimensional and lacked chemistry. Also the ending was sentimental hogwash, and entirely predictable.  Nolan was ambitious in this project, however he failed to make me feel anything except relieved it was over and somewhat angry at losing more than 2 1/2 hours of my life which would have been better spent watching The Fly for Christ sakes (and not the good one, the Jeff Goldblum one). Save yourself and avoid this turd of a movie.",1
827,"Director Christopher Nolan has once again dazzled us with his new epic, ""Inception"". Nolan has written such a multi- layered screenplay which is sure to baffle audiences. He has managed to arrange a huge cast full of talented actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Oscar nominee Ellen Page, Oscar winner Marion Cotillard, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy and 3 time Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio. The music provided by Hans Zimmer weaves other sounds along with "" Je ne regrette rien"", the song sung by Edith Piaf. CInematography : simply stunning. A special mention for Marion Cotillard for her haunting performance as Leonardo's love lost. The supporting cast in this movie is not like some prop and is utilised to the fullest. Not your average summer blockbuster. The movie deals with the themes of guilt, redemption and  the sheer ability of the human mind to do anything which is beyond the grasp of all of us. Good job, Mr. Nolan!",1

One hundred and forty-eight minutes of non-stop action, deception and philosophical questioning. This is a film that will make you ask: 'Who am I?', 'What am I?', 'Where am I?', and 'How is any of this happening?' long after the final credits roll. While the fast pace beginning may be a bit much for non-science-fiction lovers to grasp, it doesnâ",1

831,What an astonishing movie! It is my personal favourite film of all time and it can also make a case to be the best film of all time alongside Citizen Kane. However Inception will not have the same impact Kane did so it's hard to judge.,1
832,"This movie could have been so easy to screw up, the last act of the film had so many intense stories running at the same time but was flawlessly pulled off and shows how talented it's film makers are. The music, editing and acting are great. Its story has some depth and originality and many of Inceptions scenes and sets are very unique and memorable. Inception is one of 2010s best movies and will be remembered for a long time. Highly Recommended.",1
833,"Not too bad ladies and gentlemen, not bad at all. It starts with a bang and never stops. From the intense fight scenes to the emotional love scenes, the movie never slows down. During the movie, let's admit it, we were all a bit confused at some point, but never make the mistake of thinking too hard about during the film or asking the guy next to you, because you'll end up missing the explanation. If you go into this movie fully prepared to think, there will be no problem.",1
834,It was amazing and the speacial effects were great! If you ever watch this movie it is very complex so do not wach it when your tired. i would see it again and i did! 7 times! two at the movies 5 on redbox! totally watch this movie but be prepared to have to think very hard,1
835,"very good  film, little bit slow but when it gets going, it's exciting and action packed. With a good plotline and excellent acting, i would put inception in my top 10-15 films. see this film! one downside is that it leaves a disappointingly open ending after an action-packed film. you may find yourself a bit confused afterwards and may have to watch it again to gain a full understanding but on the whole, an brilliant film, and a definite must see",1
836,"Inception is easily one of my top five, and from a visual angle it's probably the best I've ever seen.  The story starts out with a scene from the end, which adds hundreds of pounds of suspense to a final hour and a half already bursting with it.  The story is never truly revealed, the web is unwound into an ever-changing plot that keeps you guessing to the very last scene.  Also, the performances from DiCaprio, Page, and the rest of the corp of actors are amazingly good.  And the suspense never ends; the ending leaves you with one last burning question.  A masterpiece.",1
838,"INCEPTION rarely fails to please.  The only time it seriously does (and as a full-fledged displeasure) is in the last 15 or 20 minutes when it gets very, very boring and the action is no longer needed for the story line (well, maybe the last scene is necessary).",1
839,"There are just three things I want to say about this film. Number One, the direction and story.....Absolutely Fantastic. Two, Acting... Everyone got an equal role in the film, and everyone did impressed me more than I expected. Three, the Soundtrack... This was the best music I ever heard to since a very very long time. Overall, a must watch and you'll definitely have a satisfied smile on your face at the end of the film !!",1
840,"Great Movie. Good Storyline. One Of My Favorite Movies Of All Time. Absoluetly A historical Movie. But, After Reading The Did You Know? for mistakes, it was a little cheesy.",1
841,"What is given is a multi-layered cake of suspense elements, and this is what Nolan is truly gifted in. Many complained that the third act of The Dark Knight had far too many moving parts, and became exhausting. What Nolan knows how to do is pile on amounts of suspense that build on each other naturally, as opposed to employing cheap gimmicks. In many ways, it's a lot like the climax of Back to the Future: Many different variables that can go wrong, all of which affect each other, thus re-organizing the plan every few minutes. If you're not worried about Marion Cotillard showing up and ruining everything, you're worried about the amount of time (three of which to keep track of), multiple threats of life, and inner-turmoil of a lead character is interesting enough to follow throughout. With a narrative this confusing, coupled with existential ideas to think about (but not too many that it becomes pretentious), Inception requires multiple viewings, and unlike some of Nolan's other movies, which got less interesting with each viewing, Inception becomes more interesting, more entertaining, and more rewarding. And, after an entire decade of stupid Shyamalan-inspired plot twists, Inception redefines it: Inception's plot twist is that it may or may not have even had a plot twist! You've officially been mind-f**ked.",1
842,"One of the most satisfying action sci-fi thrillers to date. Some people complain to be confused by the intricate but interesting plot and scenario, but the whole movie, I was so engrossed to every detail that I was never lost. Brilliant acting, wonderful special effects and a fascinating idea with plenty of twists and action along the way that will leave you interested for the entire movie, until the suspenseful ending that will leave you guessing. An incredible movie in nearly every department, and a must-see for sure.",1
843,"It is not Nolan's masterpiece (this title belongs to ""The Dark Knight""), but ""Inception"" amazed me with its powerful cast, inventive story and spellbinding visual effects.",1
844,"Interesting ending. A real conversation starter. But Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" Lacks storytelling and character. I didn't care about anybody in the film. And I was SO confused at times. but the times where I wasn't, it was a thrill ride, incredibly unique, and very suspenseful with some cool twists. But it could've been written better and it was just TOO confusing. But overall, an incredible achievement visually, and a real mind bender. It was very good, but not amazing.",1
845,This film continues to show director chris nolan's amazing film-making skills This is a film that has one of the most well crafted stories that have been on screen for a long time that manages to keep you engaged this truly a masterpiece 10 out of 10,1
846,"Pure B-movie concept with an A movie veneer and budget. An utterly tedious 2 hours of pretentious non-sense and posing actors relentlessly espousing pseudo philosophical ideas. Not fun, not smart, not a good movie.",0
847,"This is what I call an Original Film with an amazing and incredible script, and we owe to Christopher Nolan for making such a good film, with a clever screenplay, it just blow everything apart I was mesmerized by it. Everything in the movie was fantastic, i have nothing bad to say about it, it was just pure imagination and creation, and i'm very thankful for the existence of this movie. All members of the Cast were outstanding especially, Leonardo, Joseph, Ellen & Marion. This was the movie of 2010, hands down.",1
848,"Although my brother in law almost gave the ending away, I watched Inception tonight. I absolutely loved it. The acting was superb, visual effects amazing and the story fantastic.  I thought Tom Hardy was exceptional yet again. I really enjoy Leonardo Di Caprio's performances, and feel that Titanic was merely a blip. Ellen Page was wonderful, yet again, and the rest of the cast, particularly joseph gordon-levitt. Finding original ideas in films is becoming increasing difficult, with all the remakes and super heroes movies out there, so this was a real breath of fresh air. I can not praise this film enough, Nolan has done it yet again as far as I'm concerned a definite 10 out of 10",1
849,"Stunning!!!  Makes me wonder it's really workable!!! =DIt was the 2nd time I watched yet it still got me tense up & ****I'm very surprised there was just one single background theme music for the entire 2.5-hour movie; makes it very boring :(*btw, I like Marion Cotillard in this with that hair style very very much!!!& oh **** i found out it was exactly her and almost exactly that hair when she appears in Midnight in Paris!!! lol",1
850,"There are often summer films that succeed visually, but are not as spectacular without the addition of intellectual thought. It takes a while to navigate through all the confusion, but it is fascinating to see how everything works. The characters couldn't have been played better. Christopher Nolan doesn't treat his viewers as if they're stupid, but neither does he pretend he's so clever that he immediately confuses everyone. This is a rare summer film that thrills as well as fascinates, providing not just visual treats, but also intellectual ones.",1
851,"Inception is an amazing film that has a good premisis and delivers perfection. Leonardo Di Caprio's acting is as amazing as ever. The plot is very strong and the special effects that the film has are amazing, the story can get mildly confusing at times but that is the subtle point of the movie. Inception requires a lot of thinking and accomplishes that. Overall, Inception is a great film that everyone should watch and it is a film that you will remember forever.

852,"El origen (Inception): reseña en castellano / español. ___«El origen» [en inglés «Inception»] es una de las películas más interesantes que vi hasta ahora. Cristopher Nolan, su director [Memento, El caballero de la noche/Dark Night] es respetuoso con el espectador, no exagera y tampoco ofrece contenido gratuito que desmerezca las capacidades intelectuales de su público. La historia está presentada de manera prácticamente impecable porque no deja cabos sueltos y los que quedan trascienden el argumento volviéndose irrelevantes [cómo funciona la tecnología para invadir sueños, en qué marco temporal transcurre la historia o el pasado de algunos personajes de los que el mismo no es relevante para el argumento]. La trama aborda los procesos oníricos de una manera muy interesante y científicamente «plausible» sin embargo se tomaron algunas licencias para justificar los sucedido en la pantalla y eso está muy bien para la historia y muy bien por parte del director porque nos permite construir con mayor fidelidad y veracidad la fantasía que surge como exposición al contenido del film. Aquellos que estén familiarizados con los procesos oníricos así como la mitología y el psicoanálisis [con fuertes raíces mitológicas] se van a deleitar con las referencias expresas, algunas de ellas tan sutiles como los sueños: *Ariadne, el personaje de Ellen Page que se encarga de la construcción de los laberintos oníricos, toma su nombre del personaje mitológico griego, la hija del rey Minos, que le da a Teseo una bovina con hilo para que desenrolle y pueda salir del laberinto del minotauro a medida que lo incursiona. *El uso del agua como conducto entre el mundo de los sueños y el real, al igual que la fuerza de gravedad que suele ser un fenómeno que despierta a la gente con bastante frecuencia. *El empleo de la canción «Non, je ne regrette rien» de Edith Piaf como alerta que tienen los personajes para salir de los sueños porque Marion Cotillard [Mal, la esposa de Cobb] ganó el oscar como mejor actriz protagónica en 2009 por el rol principal en la adaptación cinematográfica de la vida de dicha cantante «La vie en rose». *El hecho de que la esposa de Cobb se llame Mal y represente la fuerza destructora del inconsciente de Cobb; fuerza que puede ser comparada al arquetipo de la sombra en la psicología Jungiana. *La ralentización de la percepción del tiempo en el estado onírico y su factorización exponencial a medida que se incrementan los niveles de profundidad del sueño. *La preparación anticipada que hace Cobb a Fisher antes de la inmersión en el inconsciente de este último: lo hace recordar a su padre y procesar cierta información respecto del mismo para que sea lo último que recuerde antes de dormirse y lo utilice como material de acceso inmediato en la construcción de su realidad onírica. *El personaje principal representado por Leonardo Di Caprio se llama «Cobb» [un tipo de araña] y su función es moverse por los laberintos construidos cual telas de araña para confundir a su presa, atraparla y obligarla a que se rinda para que ceda la idea que está buscando. ___Si bien en ciertos puntos se puede comparar esta película con la trilogía «Matrix», sólo puede hacerse si uno se basa el similitud de algunos conceptos como el de las realidades irreales y la presencia de mecanismos de defensa dentro de cada realidad que se manifiestan como proyecciones antropomórficas no obstante «El origen» ofrece una experiencia diferente que está basada en el conflicto interno que surge cuando la realidad que nos rodea es amarga e indeseable y una realidad alternativa es lo que más se añora, la capacidad que se tiene para influir la vida de los demás con una simple idea y las consecuencias catastróficas existenciales que eso puede tener tanto para la víctima como morales para el victimario. ___«El origen» es un film que debe ser visto porque es generoso, respetuoso, delicado y gratificante aun si su final no es lo suficientemente contundente después de todo lo que hay que atevesar como espectadores; toda la experiencia vale sus 146 minutos de duración. La realidad fantástica que nos propone Cristopher Nolan requiere de una módica cuota de voluntad y atención considerable pero retribuye con la sensación de haber visto algo complejo en un lenguaje simple, rico y directo que sin duda alguna gratificará a muchos. (c) Palfrei. 2010-08-16. Reseña completa [técnica]: http://palfrei.blogspot.com.ar/2010/08/ooxiii-resena-el-origen-inception-esp.html",1
853,"Inception is terrifically directed, brilliantly acted and bloody confusing. But, it's a multidimensional film that can be watched over and over again. And each time, you pick up more and more parts of the story that you missed or didn't quite understand. 4/4 stars.",1
854,"This is truly a thinking movie. It is abstract. If you don't want to use your brain, than don't see this movie. It's about planting  a dream in someone else's mind. While that may seem odd/stupid, Christopher Nolan expands on it. He uses great detail, and pieces that humans can understand. You don't know what's real and what's not, which makes it that much more powerful. The effects are fully driven to capture your attention. It's not the whole gun-chasing,explosions thing that leaves you as soon as you walk out of the movie. No, it's more than that. It's a movie with a message that needs to be fully understood. You can watch it again and again and still see the same points that made you love it. Original, brilliant, and exceptionally well done from the talented Nolan, it's not too far fetched to say it's one of the best movies of all time.",1
855,"Christopher Nolan another time proved that his ideas are terrific. Inception is an unbelievable fantastic movie which shows the ability of mind in dreams. The idea and the movie story are close and the truth about the main character has been involved incredibly. Tom Hardy , Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotilard have a really good performance and the others are good enough. I think Inception is not the best but its the most important movie of past decade (2000-2010) and I'm sure Christopher Nolan nest movies will be masterpieces. He is talented and deserve more chances.",1
856,"THE film of 2010. Original and imaginative filmmaking at its finest. Christopher Nolan is going places, and I'm beyond shocked he was snubbed for a directing Oscar nomination. The film is great because of it's different approach to telling you its story, and of course, messing with your mind. By the end of the film, you yourself will wonder if you are under the effects of Inception.",1
857,"One of Nolan's best films, Inception is incredibly complex and superbly executed.",1
858,Inception is amazing movie with a quite well thought out plot. Originality shines upon the script and the storyline in this movie and it is like no other you have watched. The actors have done a fantastic job with the acting and the production team was keen on the special effects and sound effects. This is truly a sci-fi movie worth watching especially for those who are in love with the aspect of the human mind and the dream state.,1
859,"One of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. It is original, and a real brainteaser. The ending of the movie is so fascinating, it's like the director just wants you to finish the plot. Really great movie!",1
860,"Inception is visually dazzling and original and fantastically entertaining. And it features acceptable performances, but I can't help but feel the whole idea of the film gets lost in the main characters own dreams. I give this film 76%.",1
861,As Tom Hardyâ,1
862,"I think this move is really incredible. To make up an entire different world, with 4 layers of a dream, is something a few directors can do. And Chris Nolan does extremely well. The way he builds up the excitement, and manage too keep you confused, yet still on the edge of your seat, since you have no idea, what's going to happen. Usually when i watch sci-fi / action movies like this one, i tend to get ""bored"" through-out the talking parts. But even second and third time i watched Inception, none of the talking bored me. I also think this might be Leo's best movie so far, I think he was perfect for the role, and this probably the first time, I've seen a movie, where i couldn't think of anyone better fit to the role. The soundtrack was amazing too, but what else can you expect from Hans Zimmer. Over all, I think far the best movie this year, and it's definitely a must-see.",1
863,"Once every so often there is a film which just takes the breath away from all who watch it and inception is by far one of those films. The story line and concept is truly remarkable and sounds like something you would learn in A-level physics. The director (Christopher Nolan) has made another oscar winner along with the dark knight and batman begins. Yes the film isnt a easy-watch by any means and it runs for a meaty 148 minutes but it is 148 minutes of: clever plot, sensible action scenes,superb acting from di caprio and put all that together and you have the greatest film of 2010",1
864,"Very complicated movie for some people. It's also very entertaining and good for a weekend movie. Nice scifi blast and complicated and interesting stoyry. Just rent it, you'll propably like it.",1
865,"""Inception"" Is the ideal movie to watch on 1080p bluray for an extreme-kindly-logic adventure to the three layers of inception to two man's mind, and each one of them is full with secrets that have long wait to be revealed.After two hours of the movie, I was sure it went only 1 minute from my life, and I believe in some point, that the movie has managed to plant the seed deep in my mind, truly a great idea for the perfect movie.",1
866,"The movie is definitely the most thought-provoking film I have seen in a long time as its entertainment value extends much further than the two hours spent watching the piece.  The encompassing concept of the film is simple: dreaming; however, Nolan takes this human capability to the limit, creating a world in which people can dream lucidly whenever they please, share said dream (via machine), and craft their surroundings to their imagination's extent--literally.  The movie begins with introducing this world to the audience as main characters Cobb (DiCaprio) and Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) are busy at work within a crumbling dream, attempting to extract information from mark Mr. Seito.  The scene introduces the nature of dreams, the conflict between Cobb and Mal, and of course--the infamous concept of dreaming within a dream.  The film develops smoothly, introducing new characters and their roles in the inception ploy, and it makes clear the ultimate goal of incepting an idea into the mind of Robert Fischer, a nascent world power.  Characters Ariadne and Arthur exemplify paradoxes and real-time dream construction and Cobb and Mal's dreamscape is explored, showing the intricacies and scope of dream potential; I'll refrain from attempting to detail dream physics in Inception.  The film culminates to an exciting-yet-mentally taxing conclusion which leaves many puzzled and yearning for answers; however, after a wikipedia search or two or perhaps a second viewing, MOST of your questions will be answered...  Regardless, It is my favorite ending of any movie (aside from The Sixth Sense-- seriously, who saw that coming?) despite the many questions I have yet to find the answer to.  Hours I have spent contemplating this film, its themes, and how they may be applied to reality, or a lack there of, and I give this a 9 in that no other movie has had such an effect.  The fact I cannot find answers to my questions/potential plot holes (How exactly do the deaths of Seito and Fischer work?  If the world with crumbling buildings is Cobbâ",1
867,"Nolan isn't afraid to dream a little bigger...Anticipators called it the movie event of the year. Sceptics called it the unnecessary cash-in following the insurmountable success of Nolan's earlier endeavour. I assure you, believe the hype. One of the most ambitious films in contemporary cinematic history, Inception engages its audience right from the opening scene like few other films before it. Everybody delivers their A-game in a movie that draws inspiration from Memento, The Dark Knight, Ocean's Eleven, James Bond and The Matrix (to name a few) yet remains powerfully original throughout.Without giving too much away, the film's protagonist Dom Cobb, a world-class thief with the ability to steal secrets directly from the dreams in which they are locked away, is asked to do the opposite: implant an artificial memory in the mind of a major corporate player, in exchange for the clearing of his tarnished name. From there Nolan leads us through a complex world of metaphysical creation; dreams- within-dreams, if you will. Indeed, it is the director's guiding yet stern hand that applies mind-bending depth to this film. By this I mean that, yes, we are required to pay extreme attention to the story at all times, but are aptly rewarded with an expertly-crafted conclusion that literally leaves your heart pounding and your head questioning the true meaning of the film long after the closing credits.Nolan has already proved himself an excellent director, and Inception has ensured his legendary status. But, for the film to be considered truly great, it would have to be driven by Dicaprio. This is his best opportunity to stand up and be counted among the greatest actors going around today, and he delivers in a big way. He portrays an inconceivably complex character in Cobb with such passion and professionalism that it really is a toss-up whether the Academy will nominate this, or another troubled role as Shutter Island's Teddy Daniels, as the vehicle towards his first independent Oscar. Not since The Godfather has such a standout lead performance been matched, if not overshadowed, by an equally brilliant supporting cast. Hardy, Watanabe, Murphy, Cotillard and Caine all act with poise, but honourable mentions must go to Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page. As Cobb's right-hand man, Gordon-Levitt shares the comic-relief responsibility with Tom Hardy, but never overplays his hand. Instead, he gives off an air of utter confidence and capability, taking a role supposedly reserved for Christian Bale and making it his own.Page plays Ariadne (alias: The Architect), the new kid on the scene who acts as the audience's window into this practice of inception. Once the introductory details are dealt with, however, her character is quickly developed into one that has great impact on the mission at hand. She adapts very smoothly in a role that couldn't be more different to her breakout role in Juno, showing exceptional versatility and a promising career in the future.Initially, I was reluctant to give this film the score I did because of a lapse in the dialogue department for most of the first hour. However, in retrospect, this aspect alone should not warrant a drop in the score considering there was no appropriate alternative available to the filmmakers at that point. This minor gripe of mine is swiftly swallowed up in a parallel world of grand cinematography, engaging plot and mental manipulation of the highest degree. You'll never look back on your dreams the same way again.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",1
868,"Good acting by the cast (absolutely loved Tom Hardy), It looks great, and it kept you interested from start to finish. I only watched it once and I had no problems understand the concept of inception or it's plot so anyone who is confused by it clearly failed to pay attention. It's a good movie.",1
869,"Christopher Nolan's foray into independent blockbuster territory is a complex, definitely ambitious and more importantly a thought provoking film that might leave you scratching your head at the end but rest assured is a very satisfying metaphysical experience. A standing testimony to why the thinking man's Hollywood blockbuster isn't dead, not as long as we have a Nolan and a Cameron.",1
870,"Director Christopher Nolan takes a break from Batman to bring us this masterpiece. Do believe all the hype, it's true, this is the one of the best movies in recent years. Dream on.",1
871,"You are not going to get much better than this. Nolan's ""Memento"" was a masterpiece but this isn't far behind if behind at all. You do need to contrate to keep up with the levels in the film because Nolen (as usual) doesn't presume his audience are imbeciles. The visuals are also stunning but for plot, ingenuity, intrigue and sheer watchability, this is cinema at its best.",1
872,INCEPTION is a brilliant and entirely original film from the director of  MEMENTO and THE DARK KNIGHT. It explores the fantastic world of dreams and what lies between in an elegant and complex crime caper that will capture your attention and imagination several times over. Nominated for 8 Academy Awards.,1
873,"Excellent movie. Great plot, awesome cast, great shooting, amazing locations. Overall a great story with tons of twist. If you like Christopher Nolan you will love this movie.",1
874,"Well i know this movie has been out a while now but i saw some of the reviews on here and really can't believe it. For one what is so difficult to understand? They tell you everything you need to know in the movie. The only thing you should be questioning is the ending as far if he is in a dream or in reality. Other than that I don't see how many movies could deserve a 0....especially one with such high production values as this. This movie is an enjoyable journey, well acted, especially the scene stealing Tom Hardy. I honestly do feel bad if you don't enjoy this movie because I believe it to be one of the better of recent history.",1
875,It's difficult to deny Christopher Nolan the brilliance of his concept. Especially when it is presented as beautifully as it is. An ensemble that will go down in history... but I can't help but wishing it was a tad bit shorter.,1
876,"First off, this would be a 9.5 out of 10. Visuals are outstanding, and the action sequences are mind-blowing. They are outstanding to watch. Acting is good to. Leo does a good job. Score is outstanding. Some of the best music well directed by Hans Zimmerman. Story is also really good. Kind of a cliffhanger at the end. Christopher NOlan never disappoint, especially with this one. One of his best films. Overall, everything is well done. It's really mind bending as the film progress that its just so good. You should really see this movie.",1
877,"For a summer blockbuster, Inception is a surprisingly original and thought-provoking film with an engaging plot filled with unpredictable twists. Christoper Nolan is one of Hollywood's best directors and Inception one of his best works.",1
878,"Very epic, unique and action packed movie. Its truely a gem, though true it can get a tad bit confusing, all you have to do is look and listen carefully. People that rate this lower than 7 cause they didnt understand the plot must seriously have low IQ, sorry but its true. The plot was amazing, though the character development wasnt top notch, the movie is about manipulating dreams, using imagination as your weapon.",1
880,"This movie is great, intelligent, amazing, majestic, exciting, not boring, it keeps you awake until the last minute and everything is ORIGINAL! Mr. Nolan, you're a genius. Inception is the best movie of 2010.",1
881,"This movie is a visual wonder, with beautiful ""worlds"" and amazing effects. I won't spoil it now, but there is an amazing Zero-G floating scene that plays out very well. You could easily get lost in the scenery of this movie. However, the whole premise of the movie is incredibly complex and confusing if it's your first time watching the movie. Having it on DVD is recommended so you can watch it again. Also, it's one of those movies where the sound gets really quiet when people are talking, but then you get blasted through the back wall when the action starts again. Points off for being confusing and for most people needing diagrams to understand it, but it's a very intelligent movie with an ending that will leave you yelling ""more!""",1
882,"This movie never felt hard to follow to me until the last 5 minutes. Whether Nolan was being deliberately ambiguous or there is a definite conclusion to be drawn I don't know if we will ever know for sure. This movie does draw one definite conclusion for me though, Nolan knows how to make very good films with compelling characters and story lines. There is not one character in this film that feels unnecessary or poorly written. If I have a quarrel with the movie it is that the action on the dream layers feels unnecessary. The characters and plot progress nicely on their own and the gun fights do little to advance this well weaved tale. A well above average movie that will be enjoyed in multiple viewings.",1
884,"Inception can be summed up in one word, brilliant. The way in which the storyline is structured is very impressive and the casting has been carefully thought through which is something most blockbuster films have failed to accomplish in recent years. Page's performance as Ariadne is debatable but nothing worth 'over-ranting' about. The CGI in the movie is magnificent but isn't over done, making it very appropriate and entertaining when used. One thing is for certain and that is that Nolan has definitely brought the best out of the actors in Inception, particular Tom Hardy who plays the role of Eames near enough pitch perfect. With a combination of stars, effects, performances, action, strong narrative & superb direction, it's hard to pick out any major faults with Inception. A must, must see.",1
885,"Damn, I'm still confused. So many possibilities... It's not a great movie, it is a brilliant movie! The way the history goes on, just makes you more and more confusing, and this is good!! One of best movies all time.",1
886,"Spectacular! Aesthetically perfect, awesome action scenes, and a story that makes you revisit the film again and again to have different interpretations, perfection is the name of this movie.",1
887,"Just one of the top 1 movies I ever see , is original , fantastic and inteligent , Chritopher Nolan should have won the Oscar for best movie and director =) and for The Dark Knght too",1
888,"The movie is great, easy to understand, after the beginning at least, and very well acted and directed. I recommend this movie to people who doubt. the concept of the movie was amazing, and the story was genius.",1
889,"I loved this movie. Although some people say that it is confusing, I didn't think so and if you think that it is confusing, just watch it again and it will make more sense. I love the cast, the premise and the way everything is shot by genius director Christopher Nolan. Definitely see this one!",1
890,An extremely entertaining and exciting movie. It as a creative plot that makes you think at least a little while you watch the movie. The entire cast does a good job in this film and the special effects are spectacular. It mixes action and a sci-fi like plot. Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone that wants to view a fantastic action filled film. It keeps you entertained the entire time and is in no way disappointing! It's definitely worth a view!,1
891,"I'm coming clean here: I've watched Inception for more than five times and everytime I finish watching it, there is always a new thing that I find out. The concept of 'token' was greatly grasped by me during my second viewing, and the idea of 'a dream-within a dream-within a dream' was perfectly understood by me in my third viewing. In short, they say that people fear what they don't understand. And the the fact that in the beginning I didn't really get what the means of the movie were feared me-in a good way- thus I always crave for more and more. Highly recommended. Especially for the serious movie-goers.",1
892,"I thoroughly enjoyed myself on this rollercoaster of a blockbuster which has to be one of the films of this decade. It has everything you could possibly want and to be honest, it was not very difficult to follow. The only thing stopping me from giving a ten is just that the idea is a tiny bit far-fetched. Upon first viewing I would have given it a ten but now I think a nine will suffice. The Dark Knight is still, in my opinion, Nolan's masterpiece.",1
893,"At first its an idea well filmed, perfect plot, neat. But watch it again and its entirely something else. It leaves you with too many unanswered questions which increase with the number of times you think over it in your head. A take at the untapped creative potential of the human mind.",1
894,"Simply nothing to critize here. Actors are great, music is fantastic (Hans Zimmer is score God!), cinematography is mind-blowing and probably the best of all time and the story is a great new story, like we haven't seen it anytime before. Those who say they didn't get the movie probably watched it too unperceptive. Everything's great with this movie!",1
895,Inception is one of the most complicated and compelling films ever made. Its one of my all time favorite films for many reasons. Its been talked about for years now and it will be talked about for years to come and it truly deserves at least that much.,1
896,"definitely one of the best movies of the decade, well written, the story is so capturing, dazzling visual effects, and smart editing and cinematography,  hans zimmer's score made it even more enjoyable,",1
897,"'Inception' is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. The concept is complex, well thought out and engaging. The visuals are brilliant and really do display HD at it's greatest. The acting is superb, as is the cast. 'Inception', I think, deserves to be called a masterpeice.The ending also has you asking yourself ""Was it a dream?"" and that is the greatest part about this film, it provides so much backstory and depth to the characters but still has you questioning the entire thing, allowing the audience to create their own interpretation and conclusion.",1
898,"Christoper Nolan has produced two of the greatest films of the modern times with Inception and The dark knight rises both over 2 hours long. I could have spent about a day in the dream world. Well this is an absolute powerhouse with complex ideas that challenge your thinking , ensemble cast of young actors ( Ellen page and JGL) and  experienced actors (Michael Caine) and of course the amazing Leo Di Caprio who doesn't seem to make a bad movie, visual effects that when you see it in the big screen the  theater offers it  feels like you are in the dream world The scenes shot across the world and in complex locations that fit perfectly with the storyline allows you to travel to every destination in your imagination. So many hidden meanings ( sorry no spoilers) and to cap it all of Hans Zimmers music just took it to a new level the best film i have ever seen ( yes multiple times) yet there are probably still things in the movie i am yet to discover. It didn't win the Oscar for best picture but anyone who has enjoyed the same experience with this film i have will understand that it doesn't need to be recognized by anyone else. Inception is Perfection",1
899,"Interesting movie, kinda reminds me of an epic Rage-Comic for some reason. Because it's your real-life problems ""epicified"" into a movie. And the way you're getting trolled at the end, it's like waking up from a dream. Luckily, I'm intelligent enough to ""kind of"" understand the movie sequences. Epic movie, go watch it :D",1
900,"Despite its two- and a half-hour length, it flies by and just like a great dream you don't want to wake up from, even after the end credits start, you'll desperately crave five more minutes.",1
901,"Inception never fails to deliver its great premise through the stylish narrative, the emotionally captivating characters, and, most of all, the extraordinarily stunning visuals.",1
902,"Luckily, I see why people don't like this movie. It's often complex, is long, and can be boring. But... it's original with incredible dialogue. Sure, it's not perfect. I love oscar-winning pictures and I enjoy the best movies possible. This isn't a classic, but it's still a pretty good movie with loads to enjoy.",1
903,"Inception is the kind of movie that should be recognized as a classic. Creative set pieces, intense action, and wonderful music, all mixed with a one of the most interesting and original concepts in years, all by a director who is the Stanley Kubrick of his time.",1
905,"Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" is a movie that needs little to no introduction. It's a movie that took Nolan somewhere around 30 years to fully create. As a result of this preparation, ""Inception"" remains the most intelligent science fiction film I've ever seen, and, not to mention, one of the greatest films I've ever seen. ""Inception"" is as much of an sci-fi film as it is an action, drama, or a mystery - it's that multifaceted. The movie features one of the most well thought out plots I've ever seen, featuring an unforgettable cast of colorful characters that are portrayed excellently by their respective actors. In a technical aspect the film is nothing short of brilliant - ""Inception"" took home most of the technical achievement Oscars at the Academy Awards this year. Another cool facet of the film (one of my favorite aspects of the movie) is the iconic, emotional, and bombastic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. This is one of those movies that renews my faith in the movie industry, as a whole. Spectacular.",1
906,"The subject matter deals with dreams; lucid dreams_ the ones in which we are aware that we're dreaming; dream-like states_ which we can't distinguish from reality; and last but not the least, dreams within dreams. It challenges its viewers to keep an open mind and demands absolute concentration and sheer force of will to follow the plot. Nolan does his best to ease the most difficult parts down our throats through putting the questions we may ask in the mouths of his characters. Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a fugitive after being suspected in his wife's death. Far from home, he yearns to see his children again. He resorts to use his considerable knowledge about dream states in stealing for various organisations to earn his living. When an opportunity presents itself to clear his name and pave the way for his return home, he jumps at it. But his feelings of guilt about the death of his wife render him unable to let go of her and thus makes him want to keep her alive in his dreams, which messes with his job when she repeatedly interferes. The movie initially plays with the notion of stealing an idea from someone's brain while they sleep. Then it proposes something even more ludicrous_ planting an idea so that it will take shape and make that person embrace it as their own. This is termed as inception. Fischer (Cillian Murphy) is heir to a corporation that his rival, Saito (Ken Watanabe), seeks to split. For that purpose the latter hires the expertise of Cobb, who assembles a team that consists of Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his second-in-command; Eames (Tom Hardy), who impersonates people inside the dreams; and Ariadne (Ellen Page), who designs the dreams. No movie experience can prepare you for what comes next and you have to rely totally on Nolan's ability to guide us through the maze. But you have to suspend disbelief and accept the movie's logic at face value that his vision is likely to happen in some world that exists somewhere, for there's no fun to be had through questioning things. The characters discuss things that we're likely to experience while we're dreaming, like the way we perceive our environment and time itself. He then uses these to construct an elaborate plot in dreams, in other dreams and dreams. It's not hard to follow. You just have to pay attention to every line uttered. There's plenty happening to keep us occupied. Shooting, car chases, skiing, rappelling, explosions and so on. No couple of minutes of expository dialogue follows without mind-blowing jolts into electrified action played to booming music. The best sequence has to be a character's solitary stand against a small force inside a revolving and later gravity-less corridor. The cinematography was masterful. The action was captured splendidly. The visual effects were spectacular_ the best among them a city folding on itself, another one falling to pieces, among others. Hans Zimmer should be credited with composing a spellbinding composition. The main theme that Nolan tries to discuss is perhaps the relations between parents and children. The main plot follows Fischer's relationship with his dying father, who he has never got along with. Cobb seeks to exploit this to complete the mission assigned to him. Cobb's own longing for his children is contrasted with this. The editing managed to keep the suspense high throughout the run. When dialogue seemed to lower our guard, it wasn't long before something jumped out at us. Some movies when getting down to the more serious part of the story seem to forget about the pacing altogether, which becomes their undoing. Moments of talking were interlaced with action flawlessly. While it is clear that Nolan uses the opportunity to arouse as much complex discussions about dream states as James Cameron did with his own and others' ideas in his earliest movies, he still condescends to include as much exposition as possible. Dream states seem to provide a superb platform for gravity defying stunts and the opportunity was not lost on him. He crammed as much action as he could without overriding the most basic of messages. The movie is the most thought-provoking during the first half when we're being educated about the physics and rules of the dream world. As Star Wars had proven previously, a film may not have to be scientifically correct to be received well both commercially and critically. I don't know if Inception does not depict proper science. People have not let this stop them from watching movies that thrill them before. They aren't going to start now. But for what its worth, Inception has better grasp on science than the former. But it doesn't succeed because of that. It succeeds because it succeeds in entertaining the hell out of us, or me at least. Some films and literature force us to think out of the box, about things that are not necessarily rooted in reality, and it is only during these times when feelings of awe are most evoked. Inception was successful in doing that.",1
907,"Awesome movie. Its not a standart movie its quiet special. You really need to think in this movie thats why i like the movie. At the start of the movie i didnt even know what the story will be. What i didnt like was the end, you dont really know if he was in the real world or not. There were some nice twist and effects that are rare. Long story short i really like that movie. Best movie like 5 years ago.",1
908,"Christopher Nolan - 4. My Mind - 0. My mind has been blown by Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, and now....Inception. Easily alongside the top films of 2010, this film is truly unbelievable in every way. Basically, if you have not seen this film, you have waited way to long, as I did. You must see this film for yourself! There is so much to be said of it, but so few words that can explain it. The story is simply brilliant, written by Nolan himself. Dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream......just when you think you got everything sorted out, Nolan dishes an ending that, like the characters, makes the audience rethink everything they just viewed. AMAZING special effects! I figured that they would be good, but I was blown away. The slow-mo, the rotating rooms, the anti-gravity scenes....awesome! Also the cast is great! I do not like Leonardo DiCaprio, but has yet to make a movie that I have disliked, so his average at best performances do not bother me. I love Ellen Page. Marion Cotillard is incredible in this film. I also loved seeing Cillian Murphy again in a Nolan film. The role of Michael Caine is cool too. Great, brilliant, mindblowing movie! Check it out! I'm still a little unsure about whether this is a 5 Star film. I loved it, BUT....I'm not a big fan of the ending. I get it and understand it, but I don't really like it. When I think of previous Nolan films like Following, Memento, The Prestige, the endings really added to the film. The ending made the film even more perfect than they already were. But here, I didn't feel it. I have only seen it once so I'm going to give it a second viewing before I say more. Still...pretty brilliant!",1
909,"A mind blowing film. Great acting, directing, cinematography, storyline, etc. A must see.",1
910,"This is my kind of movie. I loved the complexity of the idea presented in the movie: reality, fantasy, memory, deception, dreamscapes, etc. Well crafted storyline & I thought all the actors did a great job playing their characters. Some great visuals in this movie, especially in the ""dreamscapes"". The way the movie ended seems to suggest there might be another to follow. But who knows?",1
911,"Great concept and performances from the all-star cast meant that Inception pretty much had everything going for it, if only it wasn't so confusing :/ It takes a lot of concentration to work out what's going on but if you can wrap your head around all of that then you may enjoy this more than I did. Having said that, it's still a great film, and visually it is obviously quite remarkable. Overall perhaps a little too confusing for my liking but still one that you have to say you've seen!",1
912,"The butt of a thousand ""dream within a dream"" jokes. But this is a genuinely slick, fast paced and intelligent film. There are holes if you go looking for them, and the film is unlikely to change your life; but it's cyber punk at its very best nonetheless. Take away the Matrix's kung-fu and post-apocalyptic world, and you've got an idea of what this film is like. Beautiful filming locations to boot.",1
914,An beautiful world of division and similarity that encapsulates the mind to no end. I did'nt like the ending because I thought it was a cop out but a cool psychological action movie that has been the best one in a long time.,1
915,"Perhaps my favorite movie, inception is by far the most intellectually stimulating blockbuster ever created, even surpassing the Matrix.  The first time I watched this movie I liked it, but did not love it.  It takes a few repeat viewings to truly pick up on just how surreal of an atmosphere Nolan has devised through innovative plot structure, Hanz Zimmer's incredible score, and impressive cinematography, even if you understood the story.  I would give his cinematographer's name, but even though I know it, I know I'd spell it wrong.   I've heard the movie Paprika had a great influence on Inception so I don't quite know exactly how original it actually is, but rest assured, it's definitely unique among mega budgeted action films.  With it's arthouse sensibilities, huge scale, impressive visual effects, ambiguous ending, and enough (possibly) pseudo intellectuality to give Freud a headache, Inception marks a new era in blockbuster filmmaking, and will permanently cling to the deep recesses of your mind.",1
916,"its a amazing  wonderfully film ,how can b possible c this masterpiece & u don't want  take 10 point to this ?its a film that never seen b 4Nolan is a Master in directory a Film  specially this kind of movie that include Action  Theiler  stars & so many think that make a great Blockbuster",1
917,"I can honestly say that Inception is an excelent film and that it has one of my favorite directors, Christopher Nolanm doing the best he can and with great visuals and acting",1
918,A perfect mix of intelligence and originality. Truly a masterpiece.,1
919,"This movie is enjoyable with a very interesting premise and the fact it takes place within dreams lets the movie do some really cool stuff. The plot is pretty confusing and many of the characters motives were lost on me. But after watching it for a second time I can forgive the confusing plot and focus on the great characters, fantastic action and great special effects.",1
920,"Obviously, to enjoy this epic, depend on the ability of the public to understand what is happening on the screen, as the narrative structure is based on levels where action takes place simultaneously with mismatches in the speed at which time passes. Christopher Nolan took ten years to make this film conduct comprising the ability of people to enter the world of dreams. No technological explanations such as ""Star Trek"" as works of such a feat, so there is a script built like a maze where the goal of Dom Cob (Leonardo DiCaprio) is more valuable than money, but the ways to achieve this are as complex as those dreams where the information is.In the first hour set the game with the use of visual effects able to keep the mouth open, all depending on the plot demands it and not as mere filler.People often compare it with Matrix, but they should do so, which as the minutes pass such thinking is diluted to discover that it is an authentic work that deviates from what we have seen before.The performances are absolutely flawless, the story is more than epic and the visuals, without comment.Maybe some were disappointed to see the same elements but always served in a maze of ingenious script that the rest will make them feel satisfied.My Score: 100 Excellent.",1
921,"I said that The Dark Knight was Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. I WAS WRONG! This is the best movie EVER! It has an amazing storyline and an equally as amazing cast. if you haven't seen this movie, YOU ARE DEAD TO ME!!!!!!",1
922,"Una obra maestra en efectos visuales, buen equipo de actores, la actuación de Cotillard me pareció muy buena e intensa, esta película nos sumerge en ese espectacular mundo de sueños.",1
924,It was my favourite Movie. Inception is the best Nolan's movie until now and better than The Dark Knight  I love Ariadne and Cobb  They are like Joel and Ellie  :D :D :D :D  I watch Inception more than 10x  :D :D  Sorry if my English is bad :D,1
925,"What a complex film, everything about it is near perfection. The story though i won't give too much away is amazing yet simple. The acting is phenominal Joseph Gordon Luvit, Leonardo Dicrapio, Tom Hardy all steel scenes in the film hell even Ellen Page was great. The special  effects were fantastic. The music my god the music is breath taking. The film approaches a lot of subject matters, at 1st glance it seems like a normal sci  fi movie with dreams but the film does more it shows how burrying memories can lead to more pain and suffering, or sometimes you just have to let go. Overall Inception isn't only one of the best films of all time it's definately in the top 10 best films ever.",1
926,Without using any spoilers... let me warn you. This movie WILL make you wanna watch it again! I can guarantee you that! I HIGHLY recommend this amazing masterpiece to anyone who loves solving mysteries and watch fantasies! Thank you Christopher Nolan,1
927,"Inception will keep you thinking, keep you confused, and keep you hooked.  This science-fiction film will leave you thinking even after the last shocking scene. And Christopher Nolan wants us to, for this is his most imaginative film since The Prestige and Memento. Good luck ever dreaming the same way again.",1
928,"Hell, this isn't the best film ever but it's definintely one of the best of 2012. Complex and creative. This should be the number one film over Avatar. At least this was written with since and actual creativity and originality. I would say this is one of the top 10 films in 2010. The CGI like for instense (""The city folding over ontop of itself"") was pretty good and creative. I say watch it for something different.",1
929,"A confusing, complex thriller with tons of action and suspense sure to entertain all kinds of viewers. Inception gets you thinking, and that's a good thing, even if it's sometimes hard to understand. It shows you the power of the mind and dreams, which I thought was very interesting, unlike any movie I've seen before.",1
930,"This movie was really something else, in an amazing way of course. Inception really takes you into a world beyond imagination. It has the perfect element of surprise by taking you into a world of dreams. Honestly, when I first heard that this movie was about dreams, I was afraid that it would be as bad as ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"". Thank God that wasn't the case. As far as acting and the storyline go, they work together excellently. I do admit that the storyline is really confusing, but once you get use to the movies' beauty, it's really an amazing and captivating movie. Christopher Nolan is the only person I know that can make a movie about dreams very interesting. Overall, it's a mind-bending sci-fi movie on dreams.",1
931,"Inception is a great summer blockbuster. It's pretty intelligent, it's very well thought-out and it manages to be simultaneously entertaining to casual movie-goers as well as film-buffs. I really did enjoy watching this film. But is this film a masterpiece or something extremely original? Not at all. I do like Christopher Nolan's films, but him being hailed as a ""genius"" is hilarious. There are countless directors much better than him, and there are hundreds upon hundreds of films much better than this one. The more I think about this movie, the more I realize that it's nothing more than a solid summer blockbuster. The film is full of stock characters, the film has a lack of any philosophical ambitions or heavy complex themes to truly make it a work of art that can be analyzed for decades to come. What Nolan did do is create a smart summer blockbuster. In this day and age, that's gotta count for something. My Rating:7.8",1
932,"Thought you understood this movie? You're wrongs....Watch this: http://youtu.be/ginQNMiRu2w",1
933,"I neglected to review this film for a long time because I believe one must see it a great number of times before one can fully make sense of it. After seeing the film three times and theorizing for a great many hours, I finally feel ready to confront my worst nightmare, or dream. Inception gives us a very unique plot that does, granted, have elements of other blockbusters, however it's framework is still utterly unique. In a nutshell, Dom Cobb is the most skilled extractor in the world. This means that he is the best as going into people's dreams while they sleep and navigating these dreams in order to steal secrets. However, he and his team are proposed an interesting job that may give Cobb a chance to finally return home to his children. That being, Inception, the act of planting an idea rather than removing one. From there it's up to Cobb and a number of charming or interesting characters to delve into the world of dreams and prevent a new superpower from arising. First off this films biggest advantage is it's theorizing and presenting new complicated ideas. After seeing this film you will undoubtedly begin scratching your scalp in an effort to figure out what on earth it all meant. The great thing about this film is that you will, at many points, think you get it. You will be certain that you understand, but then something will happen and suddenly, you don't. I had to see this film multiple times in order to even begin to understand it. If you buy this film, don't rent it, buy it on DVD and watch it as many times as you need in order to believe you fully understand. I promise you, it'll be pretty damn difficult.In order to go into depth on how confusing this film is, let me tell you what you're in store for. In order for inception to be possible, you must enter the subject's dream. Simple enough. Then someone within the dream must have another dream, creating a dream within a dream. Then, someone within that dream within a dream must have another dream, creating a dream within a dream within a dream. Hoo. As you can imagine, the results are quite spectacular. The next best thing about this film is the special effects and the action. While the gun-play is nothing special, one particular scene involving a hotel corridor and gravity rotating is something that I still cannot process, even after sitting down and taking some Ritalin. While most of the action is good, the special effects are some of the most impressive ones that I've seen as of yet. While they don't exactly scream realistic, they are mind-boggling. I can't describe much, as my vocabulary is only human however this film does contain a large area of Paris suddenly folding over and collapsing on top of itself, creating an enclosed box world where gravity changes based on which surface you stand on. Yeah. Another excellent thing about Inception is the score. I wouldn't normally praise the soundtrack of a film seeing as how it really is only a thing on the side that merely contributes to a film's feel and mood, but I'm sorry, Hans Zimmer has outdone himself with the soundtrack to Inception so much that I have trouble understanding how he did it. Each and every song is unique, fitting, spine chilling, and most certainly makes the film even better. A really noticeable thing about all of the songs is that they all begin with a tune, which will be added to ten seconds later, then added to again, and again, until the same few notes are bursting with variety and chills. I would highly recommend looking the soundtrack up on youtube, look for ""Dream is Collapsing"" in particular. However what almost took the top spot on this movie's excellent diorama of pros is the main character, Cobb. His character itself is nothing special, however throughout the film his past of being affiliated with extraction, inception, and a character called Mal, is hinted at and eventually explained at the end, and the explanation and how the ending plays out is something truly marvellous to behold. It is brilliant watching the story's hints and nudges come together into a delicious ending pudding before the film makes it's brilliant conclusion. One thing that I must touch on however, is the strength of the final ten seconds of the film. I won't spoil them, however this ending is what gave this film its rating. This ending is what gave everyone that last spot of fuel, that last little ounce of information to finally make the mind collapse in on itself and for you to turn to your film-going companions and go ""WHAAAAAAAAAT!?"" And this small difference is what makes Inception what it is. Inception is, probably, my new favourite film of all time, and a film like that deserves this. Inceptions scores a 10/10.",1
934,"This is undoubtedly the best movie of Nolan, its complex plot and theme of the film are extremely catchy, the acting is good especially for DiCaprio, who in my opinion is his best film.",1
935,"I see Inception as a summer movie as much as I see The Dark Knight as a comic book movie, don't really fit together properly. Inception is a psychological thriller, drama, and a mystery; all while still intriguing enough for everyone to enjoy. What Christopher Nolan has accomplished with Inception is not only his masterpiece, but also one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. While this movie can't quite overshadow The Matrix, it does puts the movie to shame and every other movie that deals with the verge between reality and fantasy. The way they explain the mechanics of how the dream works just makes it feel very real (because, in retrospective, they kind of make sense), and the performances in this movie are all excellent; they feel natural and makes you feel like they have done this for ever. The only negative I can think of is that it really takes a lot of concentration to keep up with, because it's very involve with how dreams work. This movie will surpass (if not meet) your expectations because it goes beyond from were you think it's going. I saw it the day that it was released and for does people who said it wasn't cool I told ""Then get your tickets for Transformers 2, G.I JOE, or Clash of the Titans, because this is as good as 2010 is going to get"".",1
936,"Nolan chose an all star cast for this film and I can only say that he made the right choices. I have yet to notice a bad performance in this film. The pacing is great especially if you pay attention and the story is one of the most original available in Hollywood films. This movie is known to be confusing but if your mindful, you'll realize this movie is one of the best in recent time. Definitely worth a watch. In addition, the soundtrack for this movie is just awesome, I even caught myself downloading some of the tracks ",1
937,"Christopher Nolan sempre surpreende,tanto no brilhante roteiro,na muito criativa história,na direção e na produção Christopher Nolan não é apenas um dos melhores cineastas do século 21,mas também roteirista e produtor com brilhantes idéias. E ainda o filme conta com uma classe A de atores. Como protagonista Leonardo DiCaprio excelente,como coadjuvante Ellen Page,Tom Hardy,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Ken Watanabe,Cillian Murphy,Tom Berenger e Marion Cotillard. Christopher Nolan obrigado por existir e trazer obra-primas do cinema do século 21.",1
938,"Totally Different concept, good direction and DiCaprio, what more could u want ",1
939,"This is probably the most overrated movie of all time. Christopher Nolan doesn't seem to know how to explain something without expository dialog, and it gets really boring once you hear the same thing for a dozen times. This is a movie that tries to be intelligent but doesn't want to lose the appeal to the masses, and tries to fix that by making sure that everyone understands exactly what is happening, and it made me feel as though I was in a kindergarten class. While it's a gorgeous film with incredible actors, the looks don't make up for the lack of script quality.",0
940,看似难懂其实本片相对于诺兰得早期作品而言可谓相当易懂，电影充满想像力，精彩刺激，特别是三层梦境中的连环剪辑十分出彩，结尾很棒，特效超赞，配乐超级震撼，影片背后的意义则令人深思。,1

943,"I have seen a lot of great movies, but not all of them has that EPIC feel that Christopher Nolan usually delivers in his movies. Inception is not just EPIC, Inception is EPICNESS itself !!A Brilliant plot, a perfect cast, an amazing direction and production, and of course, a powerful and unique soundtrack. In my Top 3, for sure ",1
944,"Wow, reviewers on IMDb have to lighten up a bit. God forbid a movie makes you think and question something. This is one of my favorite moves. Coming out of the theater and thinking about what you just saw isn't a bad thing, and people have to realize that.",1
945,"Another masterpiece from the imaginative Christopher Nolan. Inception explores the depths of the human consciousness and bends the rules of everything logical. Dreams, obsessions and basic human aspects are a classic trait, and it never fails to deliver excitement from both from the tempo and the flawless characters. A stunning, ambitious mind-bending movie of art, that might not work all the way due to its over-complexity and a perhaps too ambitious plot, so the dialogs can be a bit too informational. But that's not something everyone will notice, and not something you should harken too. Because it's a classic sequel of the Nolan-franchise. Personal rating: 88/100Critical rating: 93/100",1
947,"This is probably one of the best movies in recent years. A perfect science fiction film that is still based in reality but still features a solid plotline. It's not nearly as ""deep"" as some people make it out to be, but it's still a fantastic film.",1
948,"Nothing against the movie, but it's too chewed for a sci-fi movie and soundtrack playing all-the-time is annoying. Despite excellent final, interesting and well elaborated plot, as like Interstellar, looks like Nolan wanted to make sci-fi for the masses.",1
949,"Nolan's Inception, as mind-blowing and thought-provoking as it is, is the type of movie you can watch a dozen times and still not completely understand. The films main plot is so complex that you may have to write it down, or draw a diagram, in order to understand it. A math teacher's dream of a movie! The acting is good, and the way it presents itself is astounding. It's amazing how someone dreamed this story up, they must've been a genius.",1
950,"This movie was amazing, and not just because of the character development or the great effects, but the way it was put together. It has some of the best ending scenes and a great plot.",1
951,"I don't need one of my typical intros here, let's just cut to the chase, ""Inception"" is brilliant. It's interesting, it's beautifully-filmed, well-acted, complex, and it shows that Christopher Nolan is not afraid to be risky by taking a nonlinear approach to storytelling. It's certainly not for everybody, and there are bound to be a number of people that completely hate it, but all in all, ""Inception"" is a fantastic film that you should definitely see at least once.",1
952,"Inception means Nolan is one-step beyond than the rest of the directors from al over the world! The film is just amazing. I couldn't even think that film was so brilliant. Metacritic film's  mark is below than it deserves. It's like a puzzle you try to figure out during the whole film, and it's so unpredictable. Di Caprio, Levitt, Hardy, Page... A great actors round up with such an incredible thing.",1

954,"Inception is exceptional.The movie is incredible with great special effects and an impressive script. Nolan once again puts on one of his famous ending twists making the film extremely entertaining in and out. The acting is good and the idea is genius.",1
955,"I'd like to comment on the polarized reviews I see of this film, and in fact, the common thread I find in the extremist-negative reviews is the individual's complaint about lack of understanding.  God forbid a film makes you think about it after you watch it and God forbid it challenges your comprehensive abilities.  I find that the most thoughtful people in my life enjoy the film immensely, and that all the people I know who are ""disappointed"" by Inception are, in my opinion at least, individuals who are very quick to judge, irrational, whimsical, and unoriginal.  It's quite a comedy just watching a large percentage of the population explode in tantrums by giving mindless scores below 2/10, just as a toddlers would when they fail to understand something.",1
956,"Incepted! When I first saw Inception it had such an effect on mind that I was driven to keep thinking about this Christopher Nolan's masterpiece for days together. Nolan’s movies make your brains work out and think and think more, his movies need your complete attention while viewing and this one is no different. Inception is not so difficult to interpret as Memento but definitely has more emotional weight than it. For a how-can-one-think-a-story-like-this screenplay by Nolan, Hans Zimmer’s evergreen score, the astonishing concept for the plot, good performances by the cast, stunning cinematography defying the concept of 'reality', the ambiguous nature of the whole film and the way it has been put together and  directed it remains my as my favorite movie till date.",1
957,"After a long time of being told that I wouldn't understand the movie, I finally gave it a go and I didn't have trouble at understanding it at all. (People obviously misunderstand me, sigh.) I might have hit the rewind button a couple of times, only so I could hear something for a second time to be completely sure. But anyway, this movie was exceptional. I have been nagging almost all of my family members and friends to watch it. Never once was I bored, my attention always completely on the movie. I would most definitely watch this movie again, I would recommend to anyone no matter what their movie 'type' is because I just loved it so much. The actors chosen played the characters exceptionally well, just over-all the film is a definite must on your 'watched-movies' list.",1
958,"Inception one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen; complete and utter garbage. Apart from the good acting and my crush on both Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, this film was terrible. I only brought this film because everyone kept raving about how good it was, but I should know better. The films that tend to be overrated are the films I hate the most, such as Skyfall and Avatar. I found Inception confusing to follow and there was too much going on at once and too many characters kept on being introduced. I just found this film boring and there was too much action to much up for the crap storyline. I am really disappointed in this film. Grade: D-",0
959,Intseption it after Christopher Nolan thriller The Dark Knight. The plot tells the story of Dominic Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who specializes in extracting information from the minds of people. He was hired by a Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe) to plant an idea in the brain of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy). For his last job Cobb assembles a team: Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as a conductor in charge of the details of the operation. Ariadne (Ellen Page) as orhitektora responsible for the construction of the world of dreams. Eames (Tom Hardy) as imetatora that can create an image of any person. Yusuf (Dileep Rao) to create a special hypnotic immersion in the world of dreams.,1
960,"A stylish and slick time-heist thriller,  Inception proves to be as thought provoking as it is visually striking.",1
961,"One of my all time favorite movies. This movie is perfect in every way. The music, the visuals, the story, the characters, the acting, just everything about this movie is perfect. Nolan just directs this movie to perfection. The story is so intriguing and confusing that i had to watch the movie 3 times at home to fully understand it and i enjoyed every viewing of this movie. Definitely the best movie of 2010. All hail Christopher Nolan.",1
962,"As good as modern movie can be. Disguised as action, wrapped into a sci-fi, hides the drama with solid background in modern psychology. Multiple layers of story-telling and cleverly planted easter eggs are an additional treat to an earning viewer. Perfection.",1
963,"10/10 one of the best movies ever first thing i read a post about the music that it drove a person insane?  are you insane? hans zimmer one of the best movie music composer around lately, the song time was outstanding. about the movie all positive good story , good acting especially at the end , good music. just a masterpieces. all people who rate this under 7 what the hell is wrong with you",1
964,The best part of the movie Inception is the brilliant direction Nolan gives to this movie other than its acting the visually striking movie gives another amazing movie to the Christopher Nolan canon.,1
965,"The buildup throughout the plot, the strong acting to the point that one can imagine countless spin-off stories with each character, execution of dream sequences and references back to itself, Inception is simply put the quintessential puzzling summer blockbuster archetype. Nolan will not co-write and direct something more perfect.",1
966,"An amazing film not only to hang out, but I understand the plot cost much at first. Either way is great and lots of action. Christopher Nolan is seen that nothing gets wasted no Inception, and hopefully see it work on other projects as well.",1
967,"Inception's ending might confuse people but the movie is a well paced sci-fi film from Christopher Nolan, the way that the movie moves and continues is just great, DiCaprio gives one of his best perfromances",1
968,"A very mind boggling film that provides a good and intelligent story about how dreams work. It's definitely going to captivate you with some moments and it may even shock you a little bit in how it's done. Overall Inception is definitely a film that doesn't mess around in terms of story and I think that it's a smart film that you will enjoy; in fact this film has a pretty crazy ending that will probably even drive you a bit crazy. But overall, Inception is a very good movie, I'd recommend it.",1
969,"this film was dazzling, breathtaking, and electrifying. the story was good enough, the graphic was cool enough, and the acting of the actor was very cool",1
970,"This movie without a doubt has one of the best directors of all time. All the shots were perfect in my opinion. The actors/actresses in this movie were really good as well. The thing that really turned me off about this movie is the fact that my mind would coast and just go somewhere else, it was a really complex movie and confusing to understand. The thing about this movie is it makes you think, a lot. Even the little things in this movie confused for example the names in it were so unheard of and complex I couldn't tell who was who. The only character I knew by name was the one Leonardo DiCaprio played because he played a character with a really simple name. Another thing that really bothered me was the sound, it was so bad I had to turn my TV up all the way for various parts of the movie, then the sound would get really loud and I'd have to turn my TV back down and that's just something that really annoyed me when watching this movie. Overall I didn't like this movie because it was really hard to concentrate on it and understand what exactly is going on. When I did know what was going on it was an amazing movie. The movie had a spectacular ending it made my heart tingle.",1
971,"I really love this movie he's one of my favourite ever!!! There is a dream cast(DiCaprio,Page,Gordon-Levitt and Murphy). This is kinda confusing for a movie but one thing is sure you never want to fall asleep or take a nap.I highly recommend it.",1
972,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. I've watched it so many times and I always pick up on new things every time. No movies as of late has surpassed it, in my opinion. Great actors, fantastic story, and the best soundtrack I have ever heard in a movie. 10/10",1
973,"Outstanding special effects, great casting, brain numbing plot twists, a sci-fi master peace. It might be a tricky to follow when you first see it, but also one of the most jaw-dropping, mind bending, outstanding movies by Christopher Nolan.",1
974,"Tam anlamıyla bir klasik, üzerinden 50 yıl geçse de seyredilmeye devam edecektir. Her filmi iyi olan Di Caprio'nun belki de en iyi filmi. Mutlaka izlenmeli.",1
975,"Inception is a film very interesting and a Sci Fi as you do not see to many movies. Di Caprio plays his role very well, and manages to make a very good movie.",1
976,"This movie is probably one the most complex and genius film I have ever seen!Christopher Nolan shows again his talent for making art in a way that will make breathless!The idea and cast is amazing! Like I said it is really complex but you will understand the film completely. It is that kind of movie that makes you think and the idea is so interesting, that you never get bored!Just a great movie and definitely worth watching and buying it!Oh and also: Hans Zimmer did another amazing job with the music! Amazing! Goosebumps!",1
977,"Inception is a well crafted movie that has a very interesting premise behind it. Not only that, but Zimmer's score really accentuates the grandiose nature of the subject material, and tugs the emotional strings when needed. The characters of Dom and Mal are developed well and the overall narrative comes to a satisfying conclusion, however Dom's companions are given little background and their motivations seem questionable. There are also a few glaring plot holes within the film that seem to contradict the 'rules' of the Dreamworld.",1
978,"Good movie with some interesting aspects that makes you think about them, but the movie is not as intelligent as everyone thinks it is. With some inconsistent elements that doesn't respect some of it's rules, the movie's world falls apart sometimes. The script could have been better, there were parts of the film were some sub-plots didn't make sense (like the murderer of Cobb's wife), and at the time the characters were explaining the dream world, they sounded like they were speaking to the audience. But overall, great movie that could have been better If it wasn't a little pretentious. Even with some issues i had with the movie, i admire the effort that was put on it, Christopher Nolan is a talented director. I recommend this film.",1
979,"That's it. Score says it all.Acting. Concept, which is as it is with Nolan, always brilliant.The best flick of 2010, or maybe whatever I've watched in the past few years. Period. Christopher Nolan is a magician.",1
980,"This is my favorite movie. This was the first movie I saw of Chris Nolan and since then I've become a huge fan. This movie is just not the one that entertain you, it opens your mind to unfathomable imaginations. Please keep producing these kind of movies Chris...!!",1
981,"This one is actually entertaining. Again so ""Nolanish"", who Im not a fan of, but the imagination is impressive.The film is again, about a story that, well no surprise, I feel is just for the hours you sit to watch the movie, I dont think about the plot after the movie, it doesnt matter really. But look at Inside Out, which is also very original but the story, coming of age, resonates with all of us.",1
982,Christopher Nolan once Again entertain us with his movie Inception.The film's Premise is amazing full of twist and turns and unpredictable.It is also visually amazing!,1
983,"Ariadne: ""Why is it so important to dream?""Cobb: ""Because, in my dreams we are together.""I haven't seen this movie in years, but after re-watching it struck me hard how depressing this was.Putting aside the action sequences and loud music and a complicate plot, there's a beautiful story about a man trying to get back to his children, without it being cheesy. Well if you really break this movie at it's core, it's about two grieving men (Leo and Murphy), both haunted by the past until they have the strength to accept reality and let them go.The 'Grow Old Together' scene stuck with me the most.You can say whatever you want about Christopher Nolan, but his movies are never hollow. I'm also convince that Nolan would be the perfect choice to direct a James Bond movie.Seriously, throughout the whole movie I was thinking ""Man imagine the genius behind Inception directing a Bond movie"". The ingredients are right there.",1
984,"Inception is one of the best movies I have seen in years. The story revolves around Dom Cobb, an expert in dream espionage. He must do one last job in order to see his family again. As the story progresses, you see how Cobb evolves as a character. The story is excellent, the acting is spot on, and the soundtrack is damn amazing. My only problem is the infuriating cliffhanger at the end of the movie. Otherwise, you should see Inception ASAP",1
985,This is my favourite movie of all time. Great cinematography. Best sound I've ever heard in a movie. The bass really adds to the atmosphere. I loved how the ending is left open for discussion. This movie was awesome at the cinema and a must own on blu ray. Leonardo Di caprio was a great actor in this flick.,1
986,"This is the only realy good movie from Christopher Nolan. Everybady look for CN like a  god of  cinema ,  and I think that his movies  are  boring .  But not this one. It has an incredible conception and the visual effects are the most crazyiest thing in the world. Well done sir!",1
987,"ReviewInceptionBrowse more images »If you know nothing else about Inception, at least know this: it is not a trick. It is ingenious but not crafty, knotty but not duplicitous. It has neither Memento’s method conceit nor the smoke and mirrors of The Prestige. To contrast it with the latter, in particular (fine film though that is), is to appreciate the difference between stage-magic and a real miracle. The director-as-magician analogy feels least tired when applied to Christopher Nolan, given his body of work, its formal and mental layers and precisely engineered reveals. At best, this approach can be exhilarating. At worst — as with the narrative drip-feed of Insomnia, his weakest picture — it is obfuscation masquerading as artistry, aka not half as bloody clever as it thinks it is. Given its setting is largely the subconscious, though, Inception can’t work with a rug-pull denouement. Every scene — let alone the movie — could be punctured with that postscript beloved of primary school story scribblers: “And I woke up and it was only a dream...” So, don’t brace for a “ta-dah!” moment — it will impede your enjoyment and waste your time. Instead, marvel at the effrontery of a filmmaker who asks you to emotionally invest in avowed mental constructs — and succeeds. In one sense, admittedly, this is what every filmmaker asks us to do: engross ourselves in their imagination. The movie, then, could be interpreted as being about craft and inspiration — one character even says, of constructing the architecture of dreams, “It’s just... pure creation.” In terms of scale and style it is, as Nolan intended, comparable to Bond’s best excursions — yet filtered through a brain-frying, subconscious-spelunking, time-dilating structure that boldly frames action sequences around each other. So we get an explosive Arctic mountain vault-storming within a zero-gravity scramble within a vehicle-crunching chase. In effect, the set-pieces are simultaneous. Which is insane, but brilliant as, while he at times boggles through the necessarily complex editing, Nolan never corrupts his multiverse’s internal logic. When you’re not basking in the visuals, you can always lean into DiCaprio and appreciate the emotion. He anchors everything. An actor who has long borne the blessing and the burden of being hailed a genius before he was even a man, he has never been less than good, but can appear either callow or try-hard, like a child dressing in daddy’s suit. Not here. He shows a depth of feeling rivalled only by his work in Shutter Island. To deliver two such turns in a career would be impressive. In a year, it’s just showing off. What makes it work, really, though, is how unfussy he is, how unselfish — there’s no showboating. Good as he is in The Departed or Gangs Of New York, you could sometimes feel the Weight of his Acting. Here, paradoxically, he appears effortless, even though he’s the beam on which the whole mighty edifice rests. It’s because you believe his journey, his heart, that you buy into Inception. If he failed, so would the movie. This isn’t the sort of performance that usually wins Oscars — it’s not ostentatious or superficially transformative, but by God it is brilliant. The strength of it is that you remain emotionally engaged, even if you’re not entirely sure what’s going on. The third act makes Memento seem about as complex as Bear In The Big Blue House. And while there is remarkable clarity given the complexity, you are pummelled with information and have to keep up — pay attention, figure it out. Like The Matrix mated with Synecdoche, New York — or a Charlie Kaufman 007. To paraphrase Casino Royale’s Vesper Lynd, it’s a meaningful pursuit in a summer of disposable entertainments. With physics-defying, thunderous action, heart-wringing emotion and an astonishing performance from DiCaprio, Nolan delivers another true original: welcome to an undiscovered country.",1

989,"Undoubtedly, some reviews are going to describe Inception as confusing. Such a description confounds me, and may be more indicative of how accepting people have become of screenplays that allow for no ambiguity and traverse plotlines by blazing trails that even a blind man could follow. For those who pay attention, Inception is not confusing. It is smart, taut, and does not reward indolence. If you zone out or make a trip to the snack bar, it will lose you. All it asks of viewers is that they do something rare: engage the intellect. Details may elude even the most attentive viewer, but the big picture will remain in focus. Despite layering dream upon dream and blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, writer/director Christopher Nolan has meticulously established Inception in such a way that getting lost is not an option. Is it a mind **** Maybe, but not one that leads to endless frustration. Nolan has a story to tell and he tells it. His main goal - at least until the end - is not screwing with the viewer's perception. He provides enough clarity that we know where we are and what we're watching and that we don't founder. In fact, one could make an argument that the straightforward nature of Nolan's approach to such potentially mind-bending material is one of Inception's weaknesses. By pulling his punches, so to speak, and keeping things mostly linear, Nolan disallows the possibility of the screenplay turning into a Mobius Strip. Influences include, most obviously, Dark City and The Matrix. There's also a sense of kinship with Martin Scorsese's recent Shutter Island, not only because that film also stars Leonardo DiCaprio, but because both productions toy with narrator perspective and the intersection of illusion with reality. However, the strongest synergy I can think of is with the TV series Caprica (the prequel to Ronald Moore's Battlestar Galactica remake), which uses a similar approach to the one employed in Inception to explore virtual realities. Inception is a less challenging project than Memento, which brought Nolan to the world's attention. It isn't as convoluted and the payoff, despite toying with our expectations, lacks the boldness of the earlier production. Still, this is a very good film that involves the intellect while at the same time not ignoring the visceral. There are numerous straightforward action scenes, including Matrix-like gravity-free hand-to-hand combat and a car chase, that inject some adrenaline into the proceedings. In fact, the entire second half of the film amounts to one massive, carefully choreographed sequence of escalating suspense as dangerous circumstances unfold across three levels of dreamscapes. Hans Zimmer's pounding score and Nolan's careful cross-cutting tie everything together perfectly. As intellectually involving as this material is, Nolan wisely does not ignore the need for the viewer to have a strong emotional attachment to the main character. Cobb's backstory unfolds gradually, with the screenplay dropping pieces, like crumbs, in front of the viewer at regular intervals. We learn the truth about his relationship with his wife and children during the course of the narrative and, as one might suspect given Nolan's apparent anti-happiness bias (his movies aren't exactly carefree and joyous), there are tragic elements. Cobb is the only character who experiences significant development - the other members of his team are secondary. They get plenty of screen time but we know little about them beyond their functions within the scheme. The special effects in Inception serve the story, rather than the other way around - which is a rare occurrence these days, when the emphasis seems to be on providing viewers with visual amusement park rides. In this case, we are presented with cities where streets defy gravity by arching overhead and massive cliffs that collapse into the sea. There is a point to everything, most often to illustrate how dreams distort the commonplace into something that defies the natural laws. Is Inception cerebral? Yes. Is it too cerebral for mass audiences? I would argue that's not the case. In a sense, one gets out of Inception what one is willing to put in. Those looking for an action/adventure film can identify that, although 148 minutes is a little long for something so simplistic. Those willing to think and puzzle a little more will find that the twists and turns of the narrative aren't as labyrinthine as they initially appear. Inception is more accessible than obtuse. It proves, among other things, that Nolan has been unwilling to bask in the success of The Dark Knight. Looking for new and exciting challenges, he has found one here.",1

991,"Whenever I think of Inception, I remember just random conversations and people saying this word. I, not having seen this movie, have no idea what they're talking about and continue on. How has someone not seen Inception? Good question to ask myself. I think this is easily a classic–perhaps not the best movie on the face of the earth, but certainly worth watching and a movie that can relate to many audiences. The characters were all intriguing and their goals and ambitions throughout were fairly clear. Finding family, planting ideas and the like. I felt like Cobb's relationship with Mal was very ordinary, the way she was torn apart by his ideas and how he now has to be the responsible adult because she can't. Ariadne's role int he movie very much felt like an easy way out on how to explain first the way Inception works and second the struggles that Cobb goes through. Don't get me wrong, it's important to know what's going on, but she almost has no personality in the way of finding Mal in his mind. The only true character development we got was from Cobb and I really think that was a missed opportunity. Despite some of the lacking aspects of these characters, the story was deeply entertaining and went beyond just the first level of thinking. It had many layers and was quite impressive. I think as a whole, the different pieces of the movie fit together very nicely with the levels of dreams and the time variations. I was able to get a real sense of anticipation during the kicks and always wanted their mission to turn out alright so they could truly plant this seed in Fischer's mind that he believes in himself. The only thing I didn't truly understand was how completing this mission would let him come back home. Was Saito the lawyer who had Mal's papers? Really that whole part was unclear to me but nonetheless we saw the desire for him to get back to his children. I really think the most impressive part of this movie was the visual effects. With the gravity and the elaborate and abstract dream worlds, this must have been no easy task and they really pulled it off in a way that made it seem so real and so realistic, despite being in someone's mind. Totally breathtaking and absolutely understandable in its visual effects and cinematography Oscar wins.",1
992,"All I can say is wow, Inception was incredible. The entire time I couldn't believe what I was watching. Inception is one of those movies you just can't keep your eyes off of. What kept me watching was the very interesting plot of people using machines that can put you in the mind of another person to retrieve information that is very important to them, and it is done so by trained specialists called ""Extractors"" who go into the subject's mind and retrieve the information that they want. For me, the whole dream within a dream idea confuses the living **** out of me, besides, that was the only thing I didn't like this movie. One of the things I like about this film is the all-star cast, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Micheal Caine were unbelievably perfect at nailing their roles. The other thing I really like about this film is the choice of the director for the film, Christopher Nolan, the man who directed the entire Dark Knight Trilogy which was amazing which made me like the choice of director.Inception is a amazing movie with a great cast and a great director, but it would be nice if they made the plot a little bit easier to understand, then I would know what is going on half the time.",1

Such awesome and complicated story, well-known actors as DiCaprio, Page and more, the soundtrack is on the highest quality. I was shocked and both sad after exiting the cinema.

996,"Inception is a science fiction puzzle that is enjoyable to solve but hurts your head in theprocess.It is tense and thrilling, and intriguing to take a ride into people's dreams.  Thegoal of the story is sometimes lost inside all the action scenes and simultaneous events and fora time felt like watching a video game where bad guys and traps continuously spawn.   I stoppedworrying for the characters for about a half hour, because all the jumping around of scenesmelted my brain. The good part of the movie is that it recovered from the craziness and did agood job of bringing the story home.  There were some flaws in how Leonardo's character treatedothers, which made his character a little unbelievable.  But I really enjoyed Ellen Page'scharacter as the observant newbie who asked all the great questions about the dream world, andTom Hardy and Joseph Gordon Leveitt were cool soldiers who have your back.  I may enjoy thismore with a second watching since I think this is the type of movie that has enough depth and rewatchability  even if you know what is happening from the beginning.",1

998,"Those rare critics who feel charitable to Michael Bay's Transformers movies like to claim that ilk of summer entertainment allows audiences to ""turn off"" their brains and submit to a big, stupid, thrill-a-minute roller-coaster ride. Judging by the ridiculous success of Transformers 1 and 2, that notion has evidently taken hold, even as it sets its rock 'em-sock 'em robots to maul accepted standards of good storytelling. But here in 2010, a Transformers off-year, writer-director Christopher Nolan's big-budget summer movie Inception is a cogent renunciation of big stupid cinema. Utilizing a plot device that simultaneously invokes Wes (Nightmare on Elm Street) Craven and Andrei (Solaris) Tarkovsky, Nolan says we can have our grand spectacle and chew it over, too. Inception posits a few interesting ideas along the way. Indeed, ideas are the stock in trade for the film's haunted hero Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio). Having learned how to install himself and his cohorts into the dreams of others, Cobb sells his services as a thief of ideas, able to access the most valuable information via the unconscious slumber of his targets. The gig can make Dom money, but it can't reunite him with his children in the U.S. (He lives in exile due to legal troubles that are, sorry, not revealed until the third act.) So Dom is susceptible when the powerful Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe) offers him a payoff that will allow him to return to his kids. But the assignment is a radical one, even for a man of Dom's talents. Instead of stealing an idea from his mark, Dom must implant an idea that it would be a smart move for the scion (Cillian Murphy) of a recently deceased industrialist to break up and sell off components of the family-owned corporation. Dom takes the job at a considerable risk. He must hire on a new unproven ""architect"" (Ellen Page) to design the necessary dreamscapes, alongside his regulars: Point man Arthur (a cool, understated Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the can-do agent and Eames (Tom Hardy) is a ""forger"" capable of disguising himself as friends and /or loved ones of the designated victim. Compounding the challenge is Mal (Marion Cotillard), a femme fatale ""dream girl"" who shows up uninvited in the dream scenarios via Dom's own subconscious to throw a wrench into his elaborate plans. Nolan's film delivers massive visual effects, including one amazing sequence set in dream-reality where the world is turned on its side and Arthur is obliged to stay on task, even if that means running on walls and ceilings or grappling with bad guys in virtual freefall. But that sequence is hardly gratuitous. Nolan stages action on four separate levels of consciousness where each deeper level is more unstable than the last. Let's just say that's a little more challenging than trying to pick out which Transformer is good and which is bad. But it's not all fun and surreal spectacle. DiCaprio and Cotillard provide a layer of emotional gravity at the film's core as Dom must contend with Mal, the demoness within. In short, Nolan does here for the heist film what he did for the comic book movie in his 2008 hit The Dark Knight. He layers a fantasy premise with provocative ideas and serious intent. Enjoy the ride. But keep the brain turned on.",1

1002,An interesting movie which could be a lot better without the disappointing acting and the weak action. The partial complexity did confuse at some points but overall the plot was ok.,1
1003,"Undoubtedly, some reviews are going to describe Inception as confusing. Such a description confounds me, and may be more indicative of how accepting people have become of screenplays that allow for no ambiguity and traverse plotlines by blazing trails that even a blind man could follow. For those who pay attention, Inception is not confusing. It is smart, taut, and does not reward indolence. If you zone out or make a trip to the snack bar, it will lose you. All it asks of viewers is that they do something rare: engage the intellect. Details may elude even the most attentive viewer, but the big picture will remain in focus. Despite layering dream upon dream and blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, writer/director Christopher Nolan has meticulously established Inception in such a way that getting lost is not an option. Is it a mind **** Maybe, but not one that leads to endless frustration. Nolan has a story to tell and he tells it. His main goal - at least until the end - is not screwing with the viewer's perception. He provides enough clarity that we know where we are and what we're watching and that we don't founder. In fact, one could make an argument that the straightforward nature of Nolan's approach to such potentially mind-bending material is one of Inception's weaknesses. By pulling his punches, so to speak, and keeping things mostly linear, Nolan disallows the possibility of the screenplay turning into a Mobius Strip. Influences include, most obviously, Dark City and The Matrix. There's also a sense of kinship with Martin Scorsese's recent Shutter Island, not only because that film also stars Leonardo DiCaprio, but because both productions toy with narrator perspective and the intersection of illusion with reality. However, the strongest synergy I can think of is with the TV series Caprica (the prequel to Ronald Moore's Battlestar Galactica remake), which uses a similar approach to the one employed in Inception to explore virtual realities. Inception is a less challenging project than Memento, which brought Nolan to the world's attention. It isn't as convoluted and the payoff, despite toying with our expectations, lacks the boldness of the earlier production. Still, this is a very good film that involves the intellect while at the same time not ignoring the visceral. There are numerous straightforward action scenes, including Matrix-like gravity-free hand-to-hand combat and a car chase, that inject some adrenaline into the proceedings. In fact, the entire second half of the film amounts to one massive, carefully choreographed sequence of escalating suspense as dangerous circumstances unfold across three levels of dreamscapes. Hans Zimmer's pounding score and Nolan's careful cross-cutting tie everything together perfectly. As intellectually involving as this material is, Nolan wisely does not ignore the need for the viewer to have a strong emotional attachment to the main character. Cobb's backstory unfolds gradually, with the screenplay dropping pieces, like crumbs, in front of the viewer at regular intervals. We learn the truth about his relationship with his wife and children during the course of the narrative and, as one might suspect given Nolan's apparent anti-happiness bias (his movies aren't exactly carefree and joyous), there are tragic elements. Cobb is the only character who experiences significant development - the other members of his team are secondary. They get plenty of screen time but we know little about them beyond their functions within the scheme. The special effects in Inception serve the story, rather than the other way around - which is a rare occurrence these days, when the emphasis seems to be on providing viewers with visual amusement park rides. In this case, we are presented with cities where streets defy gravity by arching overhead and massive cliffs that collapse into the sea. There is a point to everything, most often to illustrate how dreams distort the commonplace into something that defies the natural laws. Is Inception cerebral? Yes. Is it too cerebral for mass audiences? I would argue that's not the case. In a sense, one gets out of Inception what one is willing to put in. Those looking for an action/adventure film can identify that, although 148 minutes is a little long for something so simplistic. Those willing to think and puzzle a little more will find that the twists and turns of the narrative aren't as labyrinthine as they initially appear. Inception is more accessible than obtuse. It proves, among other things, that Nolan has been unwilling to bask in the success of The Dark Knight. Looking for new and exciting challenges, he has found one here.",1

1009,"If movies are shared dreams, then Christopher Nolan is surely one of Hollywood’s most inventive dreamers, given the evidence of his commandingly clever “Inception.” Applying a vivid sense of procedural detail to a fiendishly intricate yarn set in the labyrinth of the subconscious, the writer-director has devised a heist thriller for surrealists, a Jungian’s “Rififi,” that challenges viewers to sift through multiple layers of (un)reality. As such, it’s a conceptual tour de force unlikely to rank with Batman at the B.O., though post-“Dark Knight” anticipation and Leonardo DiCaprio should still position it as one of the summer’s hottest, classiest tickets. As a non-franchise follow-up to the enormous success of “The Dark Knight,” this long-gestating project reps something of a gamble for Warner Bros. at a time when sophisticated original entertainments are neither as common nor as bankable as they once were. Availing himself of the resources that come with a studio’s confidence, Nolan places mind-bending visual effects and a top-flight cast in service of a boldly cerebral vision that demands, and rewards, the utmost attention. Even when its ambition occasionally outstrips its execution, “Inception” tosses off more ideas and fires on more cylinders than most blockbusters would have the nerve to attempt. Our guide to this world of high-stakes corporate espionage is Dom Cobb (DiCaprio), an “extractor” paid to invade the dreams of various titans of industry and steal their top-secret ideas. Cobb plunders the psyche with practiced skill, though he’s increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. That’s what happens during a dream-raid on wealthy businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe), who is in fact merely auditioning Cobb for a far riskier job. The target is Saito’s future rival, billionaire heir Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy), and the goal is not to steal an idea but to plant one — the “inception” of the title — that will lead to the dissolution of Fischer’s empire. In Nolan’s hands, this ingenious conceit becomes no more implausible than that of a caped crimefighter, as the writer-director grounds his flight of fancy with precise methodology and an architect’s attention to detail. Indeed, Cobb retains an actual architect, Ariadne (Ellen Page), and teaches her how to mentally construct every street, building and room in the artificial world (essential if the dreamer is to be deceived) in a series of visually playful scenes whose trompe l’oeil quality brings Magritte and M.C. Escher to mind. n classic heist-movie tradition, various brainiac specialists round out Cobb’s dream team: Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Eames (“Bronson’s” Tom Hardy), a “forger” who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), who supplies the powerful sedative that pulls Fischer and Cobb’s gang into a collective stupor. As the motley crew comes together, so does our understanding of this strange, mercurial world (which owes something to the virtual-reality dystopia of “The Matrix”) and the rules by which it operates: the consequences of dying in a dream; the nature of dream time vs. real time; and the perils of layering ever more elaborate dreams within dreams. Numerous laws and paradoxes come into play once Cobb and Co. plunge down the rabbit-hole, at which point “Inception” takes on dizzying levels of complexity as the characters navigate the chambers and antechambers of Fischer’s mind. It’s heady, brain-tickling stuff, and like the spinning top that serves as a key plot device, it seems forever on the brink of toppling over, especially toward the end of the nearly 2 1/2-hour running time (editor Lee Smith has his hands full, at one point cutting feverishly among four parallel lines of action). The sheer outlandishness of the premise may open it up to some narrative nitpicking why do these dreams, for instance, so closely resemble action movies? and attentive viewers will have a grand time “aha! ing at certain points and poking holes in others. Hans Zimmer’s surging score trumpets danger and excitement with near-operatic fervor, at times suggesting the world’s most portentous foghorn, while Edith Piaf’s recording of “Non, je ne regrette rien” serves as an ironic motif (and sets up a nice inside joke with “La Vie en rose” star Cotillard). If “Inception” is a metaphysical puzzle, it’s also a metaphorical one: It’s hard not to draw connections between Cobb’s dream-weaving and Nolan’s filmmaking — an activity devoted to constructing a simulacrum of reality, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave a lasting impression. Mission accomplished.",1
1010,"Perfect movie. Full of action and agony. Unique story and perfect cast! For action, adventure and fantasy lovers.Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is very well directed, played and recorded and it is one of the (less than 10) movies I have watched that keeps you all the time excited and awake. Its main story surprised me because it was really clever and unique (not like other movies who always use the same main idea). The cast played their roles as they were in real life. The scenes were fantastic, which means that you will remember them for a long long time, cause they will surprise you! Costumes, makeup, effects etc. were perfect. Personally, I will suggest this movie as a ""MUST WATCH"" movie to anyone who likes action, adventure and fantasy movies and has not watched it yet. Unfortunately, there will be guys who won't like the movie, because it contains somehow metaphysics. My personal opinion is that this makes the whole movie unique and one of my favorite movies... Have fun watching this movie. Cause it deserves it! Cashburner - 9.3/10",1
1011,"There are only a handful of filmmakers capable of infusing spectacle with ideas, and among those, director Christopher Nolan feels uniquely tapped into the anxieties of the day. Two separate but related millennial fears drive Nolan’s ambitious, mostly dazzling new opus Inception: We have no control over our lives, and reality as we used to understand it no longer exists—or at least has been fundamentally destabilized. Squaring the beautifully engineered puzzles of Memento and The Prestige with the chaos and anarchy brought by the Joker in The Dark Knight, Inception takes place largely in a dreamscape where thieves of the mind fend off attacks from rebellious agents that clutter the subconscious. It’s a metaphysical heist picture, staged in worlds on top of worlds like nothing since Synecdoche, New York, and executed with a minimum of hand-holding. Without so much as a title to orient the audience, Nolan dives into the multiple realities of Leonardo DiCaprio, a master thief who’s made a business out of extracting secrets from people’s minds while they’re in a vulnerable dream state. His latest assignment offers a much greater challenge than usual: Instead of retrieving information, DiCaprio and his team are asked to plant an idea in someone’s head, which involves fooling the brain into believing it generated and nurtured the idea itself. (Hence the title.) In order to pull it off, DiCaprio recruits Ellen Page, an architect of sorts who can build dreamscapes densely layered enough for DiCaprio, his partner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a forger (Tom Hardy), and other co-conspirators to commit the ultimate in corporate sabotage. However, the ghosts in DiCaprio’s own subconscious wreak havoc on the operation. Nolan sets up a uniquely difficult challenge for himself: In order for Inception to work, it has to reconcile the rational and predictable (represented by Page and her maze-like constructs) with dangerously fluid, irrational impulses (represented by DiCaprio and his fevered psyche). The Nolan of The Prestige and Memento is more naturally suited to the former than the latter; the vast cryptogram of Inception has a core of real emotion, but it isn’t always matched by an abundance of visual imagination. Nonetheless, the film is an imposing, prismatic achievement, and strongly resistant to an insta-reaction; when it’s over, Nolan still seems a few steps ahead of us.",1
1012,"Chills!! That's the best way to describe this film. Nolan does it once again. Deliver us a rather complex, smart, mindf**k and not so difficult to follow epic. This film is all that you thought it would be and even more. In an era filled with spin-offs, repeats and non-original films it's difficult to find something completely original and completely out of the box.

The rest is serviceable, with a story that although not that unique, still has some interesting ideas, and cool characters. My biggest gripe probably would be the music, I like Hanz Zimmer, but I'm sick of his ""THIS IS IMPORTANT"" tone, and inception is a clear example of it going to far.

Man bekommt eine spannende Geschichte geboten, die zwar den Zuschauer dazu zwingt sehr gut aufzupassen,(da man sonst wichtige Elemente des Films nicht versteht)einem jedoch mit einer tiefgründigen, musikalisch schön untermalten und gut inszenierten Geschichte belohnt.",1
1038,"All the over-the-top images; more like a painting, are justified by reasoning, science and a little bit of imagination.InceptionNolan is a filmmaker to be afraid of. What P.T. Anderson did for straight three hours in Magnolia, you are going to have that same exhausting experience in this visual galore. Inception deals with a metaphor heist commanded by an expert extractor named Cobb whose only dream is to go home. Away from the action and the skills he masters at, and in order to reach home, he goes through the final test by embracing and learning the first thought entering his mind.I remember I was ahead of Nolan- or so I thought. I claimed to know his method of decoding a subject and then he coded this cinematic marvel in front of me. So here's how he goes through a script. He treats them like a sketch show. Simple as that. And just like in a sketch show there are plenty of sketches- duh!- surfing around it. Now, a sketch is actually a double edged sword. In the sense that it needs a start, a middle act and a final act, in every three minutes. And once you get over it- which is usually engaging for its compactness- you have to come up with an entire new idea. But this is why it favours majorly on Nolan's side. Since, he has to deal with the same world, he creates, celebrates and destroys the world in each act that also contributes to the bigger picture completing the circle and leaving us satisfied. Another thing to note here is, how he celebrates. In an ""action"" espionage thriller, you would expect some punches and bullets and explosives. But the way he celebrates- or in layman terms exaggerate or gloats- is by envisioning his germ of the idea on different set pieces and locations. Ergo, his action is never your typical luxurious action. Just watch Joseph Gorden Lewitt surviving on that hotel without or under influenced gravity.Science over emotions. Yes, I think as much as brilliant the subconscious play and the contingent unknown backup plans work on the film, I found myself cheated on the emotional background that our protagonist Cobb, played remorsefully by Leonardo DiCaprio, goes through. Don't get me wrong, the back story is incredibly rich, it's just the way it is treated. It is like after every- thrice to be precise- major event, Ellen Page and DiCaprio are told to reveal little by little information about the past in order to manipulate us. But this is just a minor flaw in this Nolan's masterpiece that not only subjugates but even belittles writers like us.",1
1039,This is my favorite movie. Inception is a movie that blew my mind. I don't know how Nolan makes this movie incredibly amazing.,1
1040,"Not very good really. I've heard the word visionary thrown Nolan's way, but this film was the work of a rather sterile imagination. Yes, it had many layers of narrative cleverly interweaved with eachother, but there was little to compel me at its core. The root cause of Cobb's state of mind just didn't grab me - partly as this relationship was never given the chance to develop to a tangible level. The elements of subconscious displayed were tame and the approach to the dreamworld rather banal - focusing as it did mainly on bland designs, bendy gimmicks and exploding things. There was little edge to Nolan's vision, he seemed quite happy to drown us in relentless exposition and unimaginative slow-mo shots. Scenes were very quick and at no point approached the atmosphere and interest of a real dream. A shame, because at their best, this is what films can do - engineer the quality of a waking dream. Compare Inception to the more intriguing work of Lynch, where scenes seduce with the perfect balance of the real and surreal, and whose images tend to linger in the mind. On top of this, Nolan is simply not a very good director of action; he is quite loose with the camera, and I yearned for more flair and invention in these scenes. Instead, he relied on an incredibly insistent score to give the action some punch. For a film about dreams and the subconscious, it was curiously impersonal and mechanical. Certainly, the real danger and sexuality of the subconscious might scare off mainstream audiences, but Nolan was given free reign to do what he wanted - so why not do something more interesting? Freud and Jung would find little to interest them here, as the film is less concerned with psychology and more with the narrative possibilities afforded by a convoluted dreamworld fiction. Perhaps Nolan does dream of corporate worlds and Bond fortresses. Unfortunately, such things don't interest me",1
1041,"Inception is one of those films you can't take your eyes and ears off of. Everything requires your attention in order to understand it. But once you do, you discover an incredible sci-fi action flick that has very interesting ideas and some of the best special effects to hit the big screen.",1
1042,"This film revolves around the theft of ideas, pushed to the limit, with the thief entering into the mind of another person through a dream made for that purpose. It has the main actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy (all in the guise of a team of thieves of ideas) and Ken Watanabe (in the role of a powerful Japanese chairman). Christopher Nolan took charge of the script and direction.It is undoubtedly an interesting, intellectually challenging and well-crafted film. The rich and intricate script gives us a solid, well-imagined story with good characters (the two main characters, attributed to DiCaprio and Watanabe, are even more worked and function as antagonists). Despite this, the contained and reserved form as the characters demonstrate emotions makes the movie a bit cold from the emotional point of view. The emotions are there, they just prefer to demonstrate them in a discreet way. The script could have even explored the emotional and psychological consequences of stealing ideas, for the thief and for those who are robbed, but prefers to remain in the realm of material consequences. The end of the film is good but, from a certain moment, it becomes slow and predictable. Despite this, praise is given to the performance of Nolan as well as the main actors. DiCaprio fulfilled our expectations, Ellen Page was a pleasant surprise and the rest of the cast was up to the challenge.Although not a perfect movie, there is no doubt that it is good. It's a movie that will be more pleasing to the more intellectual, audiences who do not like movies where thinking is needed to understand it will probably have more difficulty in enjoying it.",1

It's incredibly amazing, if you think that everything happened in a plane. Its philosophical idea s very similar with Matrix, but it feels more close, because we experience it every day when we sleep.

Aparte de esto  Nolan tiene talento para crear una trama, pero en el resto de puntos generales no tanto, el principal problema son las conveniencias todo pasa porque asi nesecita Nolan  que pasen las cosas y hay muchos agujeros de guion que se nota que Nolan esta forzando a la trama.

By projecting himself deep into the subconscious of his targets, he can glean information that even the best computer hackers can't get to. In the world of corporate espionage, Cobb is the ultimate weapon. But even weapons have their weakness, and when Cobb loses everything, he's forced to embark on one final mission in a desperate quest for redemption. This time, Cobb won't be harvesting an idea, but sowing one. Should he and his team of specialists succeed, they will have discovered a new frontier in the art of psychic espionage. They've planned everything to perfection, and they have all the tools to get the job done. Their mission is complicated, however, by the sudden appearance of a malevolent foe that seems to know exactly what they're up to, and precisely how to stop them.Everything with this movie is amazing, I mean every-single-thing, from the very beginning to the very end, you never get bored, you never get tired of this amazing 2h 28min masterpiece, you know why? Because this movie has a story that it never ends during the movie, to be more clear, every moment a new thing reveals so you won't get bored of it!The performances also are talented, everyone was more than amazing, I was amazed of how they were acting! Also the CGI, it was pretty amazing, it was sinless, actually everything about this movie is sinless.. anyways... The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, what can I say? Stunning, I.. loved.. it!! And now, the direction, every shot was well-directed, the direction really really was amazing, Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all the time.. actually, this movie contain lots of my favorite stuff: favorite director (Christopher Nolan), favorite composer (Hans Zimmer) and my favorite actor (Tom Hardy).The plot didn't explain too much to keep you excited and hype, also it didn't set up the characters cause they will be explained later on, and I meant to say ""explained"" because these characters are super-complex. After the plot the movie took a great twist with the first act by being  little pit clear, you think? The second act came to make it complicated again, but don't worry, the third act is here to help you by setting everything in the right place.Inception is an A+ movie!Alright, guys, lots of Christopher Nolan movies coming up thanks -as always- for reading my review, hope you like, and if you do, you can check all of my reviews right here.",1
1057,A really amazing film. Must see. It is interesting how Nolan brings an abstract concept to life. Beautiful story. True inspiration.,1
1058,"""Origen"" en Castellano o ""Inception"" en su título original, una película protagonizada por Leonardo DiCaprio y Tom Hardy entre otros, dirigida por el gran Cristopher Nolan. Me alucinó en su momento cuando la vi, creo que fue en el 2010, ya el comienzo es una pasada y como tratan el tema de los sueños y luego los sueños dentro de los sueños... Y encima el final que tiene la cinta, en mi opinión épica, chapó. 10 sobre 10 sin pestañear. Mi séptima crítica u/o review de la sección de Movies.",1
1059,"Inception is a masterpiece of the decade. The movie isn't the typical linear movie from start to finish. The whole idea and concept of dreaming being made into a movie with multiple layers. It doesn't always tells you what the movie means, leaving the audience to think for themselves about what was meant in that scene. The movie is full of unpredictable twists, taking science fiction to the next level, taking a little thing as dreaming and turning it into a theory and concept. Nolan picked a great cast for the movie (Leonardo DiCaprio, Cillian Murphy) which is one of the foundations of the greatness of this movie along with the script and Nolan's cinematography, great use of CGI and the idea of dreaming. Despite it being science fiction, the movie isn't overly exaggerated as it could've been and tries to be as realistic as possible whilst keeping the audience engaged and having the right amount of action. Also not to forget to mention the music composed by Hans Zimmer which is absolutely amazing and made for one of the best endings to a movie in my opinion. The ending got people talking for a long time debating if Cobb is back to reality or if he's still in a dream and that is when you know the movie was done right.",1
1060,Inception is Christopher Nolan’s masterpiece and an action movie worth several re-watches.,1
1061,"This movie had leveled up people's dream with being upside down or floating, city bending, explosive things,... Han Zimmer's score was perfect for this action dream movie. But then I wondered: why there os so much action? That is what mades the film a bit corny but at least Christopher Nolan had done an excellent job to entertain the audiences",1
1063,"the relevant first movie i can remember that tells you about a dream within a dream. No tragic turns, but a decent plot.",1
1064,Amazing movie . A must watch. People who love sci-fi and thriller movies must watch it . Amazing acting by everyone specially by Leonardo .,1
1065,"Some like it because it's mind-boggling and cryptic, but some see a deeper allegorical meaning in it. What it means is up to the viewer, and it's interesting because it represents something different for everyone.",1
1066,"One of the most creative pieces ever created, perfect balance between plot and action that only Christopher Nolan himself could create",1
1067,"The best movie i've ever seen, nobody really knows what happens at the end or if you should be happy about some stuff you see. Over a decade and it's still one of the most discussed movie.If you don't understand some stuff after watching it for 1 Time you should watch it again and knowing some later stuff you will understand  a bit more and more. It al makes sense not like in Matrix where stuff just happens.10/10 Story10/10 Music10/10 scenery",1
1068,it was amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing!!!a beautiful and complex story with a perfect ending and perfect acting.,1
1069,"Holy hell, this movie blew my mind. A really intelligent plot that manages to catch you by surprise in the end, while making you question about its ending, the acting is amazing, the direction is incredible, the special effects are wonderful to see, the idea of the movie is really creative, and all of that was mixed to an amazing experience of a movie.",1
