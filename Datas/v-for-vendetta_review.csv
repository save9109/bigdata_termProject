0,Remember The 5th Of NovemberThis Film Pretty Much Is A Masterpiece From Beginning To End.,1
1,"V for Vendetta I would describe as 'The best F*** the government' film. It was not another fantasy-super hero movie with super predictable storyline - saving everybody, while a great love flares and of course - happy ending. Decent movie.",1
2," One of the best films ive seen in a ong time, the Guy Fawkes mask surprisingly never gets old throughout the movie, V's character is original even though he echoes many characters throughout history, very fun to imagine and not hard to believe, gets a 10 without a doubt.",1
3, Awesome!!!,1
4, this is a great movie to see.,1
5, This is by far the most down to the point movie I have watched.,1
6, This was a readlly good movie! i recommend it to everyone!,1
7," Acting, plot, and story are excellent. Ending tops it off perfectly. Couldn't have asked for more...",1
8," You people are crazy. Whether some people believe it or not, movies affect and move people. When I get done watching what I believe to be a great movie, I get a great feeling after watching it. And that's what I felt after this one. One of the best stories I've seen out of Hollywood so far. LOVE IT!",1
9, The language that V employs in the movie alone makes it worth the watch. It is definently one of the best movies I have seen made in a long while.,1
10," I love it. I love all of you. I wonder what is it people go for in movies anymore. We complain about acting, about facts, about realism. Then we complain this or that is not true, or this and that is ripped off that guy's book. HEY. Let me remind you something real quick, boys. A movie isn't reality. V for Vendetta is an attempt at reproducing a book's story into visual interest. Had they actually made the entire book into a movie, you'd not have two hours on your hands, but perhaps SIX full hours. [***SPOILERS***] Many of the events were crossed out to squeeze the movie into something as short as possible, while remaining entertaining. What REALLY MATTERED about this movie's success, was that it STAYED loyal to its origins. Not that it entered the norms of literacy and whatever other crap some of you may complain about. In terms of cinematography, this movie blends in together theatrical pleasure and drama perfectly well. You might as well feel that most scenes are shot much like a Shakespearian play. (I'm gonna get flamed for this one in the future) You may be called simplistic by some pseudo-intellectual people for liking this movie. But what counts is not the quantity of references you may attach to it. It's the quality of them. The movie stayed true to the book in many facts, aside that it replaced the past of the book with today. Instead of the Cold War ending with general nuclear warfare, it was America's war on Iraq which spread out too much for its own good. It's not very likely to happen, but the movie reflects ""what ifs"". Other people may even complain about not understanding a thing that is said. Those people just are looking for a typical action movie, where nearly no acting is given and more gunning and killing occurs. V justified every fighting sequence, and made them count into the storyline. Now, remember dear children of cinematography: You're not looking for pure masterpieces when watching a movie. You're looking for entertainment and something of VISUAL and AUDITIVE quality. You may discuss politics when watching the news, otherwise you are just messing with the useless.",1
11,"V for Vendetta feels like a personal vendetta against today's government but one can not help admire its deeply thought characters, great visuals and intriguing storyline & premise.",1
12," Excellent Movie, Best message and a peak of what may be a visible future for America. Watch it twice.",1
13,"Now, ""V for Vendetta"" here is a great example of how graphic novel-based books should be when made into a movie. The story is deeply involved into the movie as well as the characters and their significance. Natalie Portman especially does a exceptional, outstanding performance as V's girlfriend (?). Must watch!!!",1
14,"This blast of subversive pop cinema is a thrill ride from beginning to end, and probably stands as the best film adaptation of all Alan Moore's work. However, the production is both propelled and impaired by the Wachowski Brothers' influence - the stylized violence is bound to be campy in a few years' time and the dramatic storyline is carried too much by actors with the same serious deadpan British accent (hearing just audio, I doubt I'd be able to differentiate the voices.) Still, in the end, the movie gives us exactly what we want - controversy, an awesome antihero, and a huge, giant explosion.",1
15,"Superb acting, really awesome lines, great action, and an effective political message. what more can you ask for?? This was really well done and there were scenes when i was like ""yes!""",1
16,"I thought this film was fantastic.I think that the way Hugo Weaving portrayed V without ever showing his face was a great testament to his ability as actor and Natalie Portman was great as well.The tone and setting is great as well and as a fan of dystopian film and literature, this film hooked me straight away.",1
17,"An all-around dreadful film. Terrible dialogue, subpar acting, wrapped in a story filled with absurd, juvenile politics with obvious and obligatory nods to the present-day ""War on Terror"" for easily amused critics to fawn over. Provoked no emotional or visceral reaction from me, other than laughter at its banality, and when it ended, astonishment at how such garbage could be so widely praised. If you're out of high school, and like good films, pass on this.",0
18," A waste of time. Tries too many directions at once: arthouse, action entertainment, and moral message. Without any clear direction it failed to make sense or even entertain. I can give up the money for a rental, but I felt robbed of my time.",0
19," V for Very Very Bad Film - As a fan of the comic, my opinion might be considered biased, but the FIVE people I took with me to the cinema had never heard of Alan Moore or V for Vendetta and we all roundly thought that this film was utterly rubbish. Don't be fooled by the trailer, there isn't enough action to provide half-decent entertainment. Instead the Wachowski Boys are trying their damnedest to be intelligent and they just make everybody sound stupid. There is a fine line between poking fun at the British and being completely patronizing. Maybe that can explain the good reviews of this film over on that side of the Atlantic, but I can't explain the good reviews of it that we've had over here. There is nothing to recommend this film apart from a mildly amusing Benny Hill type sketch in the middle. Utterly cringeworthy. I was embarrassed that I had recommended going to see it.",0
20," This has to be one of the best movies I""ve seen this year [so far]. It's great when an action movie, well, doesn't use action to move the story. Hugo Weaving once again amazes me at his ability to act any part, and he made V a very likeable character. Natalie Portman was pretty good, I guess. But as I mentioned earlier about an action movie that doesn't use action to move the plot, V for Vendetta ending action was executed perfectly. It also showed that V isn't perfect. I always love when a movie gives me the shivers. And that makes a great movie.",1
21," Very dissapointed, most of the Anti-Bush down with America crowd will resonate with it and give it high marks, I personally thought it was rubbish, I was nodding off. One or two CGI scenes that were done well, the rest was just pretty poor. Too bad, I was hoping it would be much better.",0
22," I thought the movie was a little bland. It had an interesting story and some cool ideas, but I thought the execution was off. Still worth seeing though.",1
23,"Blimey, there's some scathing comments there. I really enjoyed this film, maybe more so because I treated it as a work of fiction and didn't draw comparisons between it and the real world. A good storyline, decent enough acting, some fine visuals and some good plot twists made good viewing.",1
25," Decent movie, but it's slow pace will mean many might not like it!",1
26, The best film since Forty Year Old Virgin.,1
29, I totally enjoyed this movie. Also frightened me as it should frighten everyone. I see evidence every day of our society moving closer and closer to this very situation. Too real. I think this movie accomplished what it set out to do.,1
31, The film won,0
33," Just got back from V for Vendetta. Bad bad acting (Portman's pretentious accent sucked) or the boring buildup; the really dull action scenes or the one sided cliched dialogue. And it ran for like three hours. Not to mention HUGE plot holes. At the end of it all I was completely disoriented. What's with the Tchaikovsky music, or the TV infatuation? Or the overuse of 'bollocks' ? If there was *any* pseudo philosophical symbolism hidden in the movie someplace, they did not make an effort to get the message out.",0
34, The worst thing about this film is that it makes the ideals of Anarchism and the Libertarian-Left sound completely stupid.,0
35, Argh! Forget the politics! This simply isn't a very good film!,0
36," I feel this movie skimmed the surface of several American political issues without explanation or justification of any of them. I perceived blame being assigned to the US for terrorism and tyranny. Had this movie's political agenda been properly billed I would have never given my money for such psycho babble politics. One of the ""good guys"" had a nazi flag with the Koran in his secret room. This movie was pure garbage!",0
39," I'm dumber for having seen this movie. Incoherent, lacking in style, over-wrought pretentious dialogue. Like a pissed off teenager who can't get laid wrote it. Geez.",0
40," Look. Alan Moore had his name taken off the credits for a reason. The original comic is a magnificent piece of subversive, political and social commentary; this film is cynical action fodder, pandering to the feeble idea that we the public are all 'good people' who rise up when oppressed by the forces of evil. Give me a break. Moore tackled issues of complicity and how fascism can be taken as a viable system of government. He created a piece of work that demmands introspection from its audience. This film removes any value from its original source and replaces it with another empty piece of 'entertainment', peddling the usual nonsense that 'good people' (us) only let bad, destructive people into power when they have been tricked. This film is a cop out on every level.",0
41, a quixotic piece of orwellian gargage. watching this movie is like eating bananas without peeling them.,0
42," This is a simple movie for children, posing as ""art"". It takes more than a 130 minute running time to make a movie compelling. You'd have thought that after the dreadful Matrix sequels, the Wachowski brothers would have realised that.",0
43," Decent acting. Sophomoric attempt at political philosophy. Actually, just plain stupid when all said and done.",0
44," I was expecting a lot better, maybe. It turned out to be a liberal, leftist propaganda vehicle first, story second. The only good press it got was from mainly liberal publications. Go figure. Beyond my disagreement with the beliefs expressed, this could've been made so much better, as the concept could've been riveting. Instead it was boring as all hell and preachy to boot.",0
45," A completely farcical take on Orwell's 1984 with one of the worst 'acting performances' by Natalie Portman to date. Superficiality of characters, plot and politics and not even in a entertaining way. Special mention must go to the cringe worthy script with a fetish for sophomore-level alliteration starting with the letter 'v'. In short, the perfect film for a general acclaim and fit to shelve next to other recent entries in the IMDb top250 such as Million Dollar Baby, Children of Men and Labirinto del Fauno which most dreadfully shows the abysmal decline in good taste and cinematic appreciation which is sweeping the Earth like a virus.",0
46,Horrible movie. One of the worst from McTrigue yet!!,0
47," Boring. Unengaging. While watching the film, I found I couldn't care less about the characters -- no pathos. Don't waste your time.",0
48," movie was awful. If you have people you cant stand, suggest this movie to them. The only part i enjoyed were the end credits!",0
49," Rolling Stone hypes up the film and poor me, I see the damned thing. This film is The Political Matrix. There's an attempt at making it seem like this will happen to the world in the next couple of years and that we will have to blow up government to make it better. Natalie Portman even has a Keanu Reeves moment in the train, when she just stares. Guns are better, and so was the Matrix. F... this movie.",0
50," Turd on a stick. If you're interested in the drama side of this story, read 1984. If you're interested in the action side, rent Demolition Man.",0
51," The whole point about fascism is that it's driven by nihilism. I don't like George Bush either, but maybe if the Wachowski brothers understood this, they wouldn't have spent quite so much time fetishizing Nazi aesthetics and celebrating senseless violence for its own sake.",0
52," I was just bored out of my mind by this movie. And did anyone else think the finale was reminiscent of the end of ""Caddyshack"", when Carl blows up the golf course? It was funny! I don't think that's what the director was going for.",0
54," Marxists and anarchists will love this movie. The basic theme? Christians are fascists who seek to round up all the gays and Muslims, USA and UK ""Coalition of the willing"" are nazis who kill their own people with bio weapons to create a police state. The looney left's beliefs brought to the big screen at last!",0
55, I cant believe there are people that actually admire this movie. Its the same people that probably never took a political science class or read a book about history of politics. It over simplifies a totalitarian regime and makes a terrorist look like a hero. If you can make money with such crap..says a lot about the majority of people.,0
56," I didnt know what to expect with this film, i did not however expect to see a terrible film...which is exactly what i got. boring. pure boredom is what i got out of this movie.",0
57," WARNING: This movie is a diabolically conceived slew of hate propoganda, don't be fooled. Does terrorism seem cool to you? Yet, we see the ultra left, the so called champions of peace, poison the minds of young americans (who is the target audience) with this tripe, glorifying evil.",0
59," Horrible, horrible movie. Everything in it seemed to be so poorly executed it was quite embarrassing and cringe worthy to witness. It wasn't even engaging enough to be a brainless entertainment flick, just boring pacing, plot, direction and acting. The good responses this film has gotten astounds and confuses me.",0
61, Im not saying Hugo Weaving didn't do a good V or that Natalie Portman cant act all those features were what might this movie okay instead of lying in a gutter what i'm concerned about is the story. what were they thinking what kind of government what do that besides comunists and who does V think he is blowing up random monuments to show he means business I'm sorry but it's a load of worthless action... NOTE: do not see this movie unless you enjoy raw action then go ahead.,0
64," What a disappointment! Part rambling, babbling political rally drivel, mixed with Natalie Portman dealing with the affections of older men (yuck). Earth to Wachowski brothers!: if you're going to have a man with a British accent, wearing a mask, give numerous monologues, please tone down the background music so we might be able to make it all out.",0
67," The movie started out badly and it ended even worse!! An intresting idea, but badly excuted.",0
68," Hard to imagine why all of the good grades here for V. Must be an age gap, because I cant think of any reason why anyone over 21 would like this movie. At least Natalie Portman is in it, but then they cut her hair and ruin that too. Very shallow, undeveloped plot that takes to long to go nowhere.",0
69," Catholic fascists take over England, put up big black and red crosses, repress gays, execute people for possessing the Koran, and rule by fear. Only a masked wierdo can save them. He does this by--well, that would ruin it. Suffice it to say, the ending is absurd. Written by the Wachowski brothers and produced by Joel Silver.",0
70," Over the top trash unbelievable trash. Revolution? I'd like to see what happens next... It's tried to be too clever. Theres nothing to tell us why the government has seemingly gone crazy and decided to shout at everyone... ;Portman's performance is awful, not sure anyone who has reviewed this is English but to me its pretty blatant from the start her voice is dodgy . Silly action sequences where V can withstand 5 billion bullets. Doesn't make you think. Sound is bland. Anything else? Oh yes, its all very well blowing buildings up but it really won't sort anything out. I can see that humankind is supposed to be united under tragedies like oppression but this just wouldn't happen. Not even in a world where people where gimpy masks. There is a reason for law! Anarchy in the UK? No thanks. It's more of a personal thing to express oneself in a rebellious and sometimes stupid way but this film captures what the UK would be like if everyone had taken crack and then decided to terrorize parliament. Ridiculous! Probably the worst film I have seen since Revolver! 1 star because the DVD didn't break.",0
71,"Scarcely a single redeeming quality. Managed to see that other piece-of-shit juvenile myopic lefty vision of a future fascist dystopia Britain Children of Men for I saw this (for the record, I'm left-wing too), but this one, although too calamitously silly to be as bland as the aforementioned film, takes biscuit in the laughable stakes. Jurn Hurt LITERALLY has the same expression on his face every time we see him (while he's alive). Portman spends the film sitting in people's living rooms and being tortured and generally struggling to conjure up an convincing facial expression (why is this woman allowed to work in film?), Weaving talks in awkward, pretentious riddles, and stabs people. It didn't seem possible that the Wachowski Bros could something more cringemakingly awful than the Matrix Revolutions, but it appears they have truely outdone themselves.",0
73, V is for very tedious and tiresome. Totally derivative crap.,0
74,"I have to agree with the user who stated that the best part of the film is the ending credits. Seriously, ""Street Fighting Man"" by the Stones and the artwork accompanying it were brilliant.  But seriously, people, admit that you had to struggle a little to like this movie.  It has MAJOR pacing problems.  At least 7 or 8 times I looked at my friend and said, ""Damn!  They're got to keep this thing moving!""  And I loved the subtle propaganda of such items as the poster that read ""Coalition of the Willing"" - which featured the American Flag & British Union Jack superimposed with the Swastika.  Yeah, attemped to remove a dictator and free 30 million people to create democracy, and you're compared to a regime that exterminated 5 million jews in concentration camps.  That's reality.  Folks, if the US and the UK are the biggest enemies in the world, the rest of the globe must be a utopia.",0
75," I cannot believe the good reviews this movie has gotten. It ignores the interesting characters (the bad guys) and never tells us how in the world V does everything he does. That would have been more interesting. Poor Natalie Portman, either looking scared or lost. Stating the obvious in line after line. We spend much time on back stories of people we do not care about - their fate is sealed.",0
76," This film is pedantic and takes itself way too seriously and the effect was to make it unintentionally humorous. The writers thought the audience would be too stupid to see the self-inherent evils of a fascist regime, so they needed to manipulate us by portraying them as ugly, shifty-eyed rapists. It would have been more thought provoking and real had they been portrayed as charasmatic or, better yet, like your co-worker or next door neighbor, the average Joe. What a cliche that the antagonists were motivated, really, by power and not their ideology. True Belivers are always the most freightening. The writing was hackneyed and overly Verbose in an apparent attempt to give the film some sort of legitimacy through seeming literary. Thick melodrama made it impossible to empathize with the characters or care what happened to them. Five minutes into the film I had a vision of the writers hunched over the 'V' section of Webster's frantically trying to shoehorn every word into a coherent sentence. What exactly is the film's message supposed to be? Buildings can be blown up without killing innocents but instead be capped with an uplifting fireworks finale? Replacing the devastation caused by blowing up a building with a tame 4th of July display is a bone chilling piece of apologist propaganda. Anyone who thinks this film blurs the line between terrorists and 'freedom fighters' is a few cards short of a full deck. The fact that the writers needed to portray England as some sort of cartoonish neo-Nazi dictatorship to gride their political ax proves the lameness of their position. However, Natalie Portman does a nice job despite the poor script. Stephen Rea was the highlight of the film.",0
77," I do not want to sound over the top and completely slag this film off but it is officially the third time I walked out of a film because it got embarassing to watch (the last was AI). I thought it would be interesting because I quite enjoyed books such as '1984', 'Clockwork Orange' and 'Brave New World', all set in dystopian sociaties, but thought this was a really dumb effort, and it's almost laughable that people can even respond to the message that the film conveys when it is done by such silly means. Perhaps then I can enjoy the action, acting, settings etc instead. Well no actually. The action scenes were just as ridiculous as 'The Matrix' which is partly why I cannot take it seriously. And the acting was some of the worst I have ever seen. I appreciate when people hate a film and write a review they tend to say the acting is bad even if it isn't because they're in rant mode. But here it really is. English people really don't talk like that - i.e. they don't all sound like snobs. The way English accents are done in Hollywood films can be terrible. It was just all very unconvincing and cringeworthy at parts. So not only is the message ruined by how unrealistic it all is, it is difficult to enjoy the story when you are constantly reminded that the characters are all just actors trying to put on a silly accent. Seriously, the British accents here are almost suitable for a comedy. To mention a few postives. There were the odd funny moments - it was not taking itself to seriously thank god. Some of the visuals were also quite impressive. And, in fairness, maybe the actors were not actually that bad and it was just the rubbish dialogue that made them seem like they were. It is a dumb film that wants to be clever but not everyone is like me and enjoys dumb clever films anyway.",0
78,"Entirely self-contraticting, whoever came up with this movie and wrote the script simply wanted to make themselves seem smart by stealing real ideas from people like Orwell, but they werent smart enough to know what to do with those ideas, so they just used a bunch of verbage to make it sound like they knew what they were talking about. It was hard for me to sit through this movie without tearing its ""ideas"" apart, and the write snuck in a couple social commentaries that had nothing to do with anything. If you think this is thought-provoking and smart, read Orwell's 1984 to find out what those words really mean.",0
79,"Fantastic, extremely well written, and the performances by the cast are outstanding, truly a must see, it causes you to think, will stick with you long after watching it, and conveys a message, a message that should be taught, believed in, and acted upon, and that message is ""People shouldn't fear the Government, the Government should fear the people"".",1
80," Wow, just wow. This piece of firery entetainment did the impossible and gave a rousing action story, deep and meaningful characters and a point to their message, all in two hours. This movie grabs it's story with both hands, and never lets back. Although the performances are not outstanding, the directors have created a well following plot that gives justice to the original, yet still packs a punch. V for Vendetta is relevant today as it has always been, and V's monologues are humourous if not disconcerning. The detective work was also done to prefection, making the reach to the bottom of the truth so satisfying and entertaining. I ask the people moaning about this movie: What is there to complain about? This are ideas that PRECEDE 9/11 but still resonate today. If you went here seeking an action movie or a love scene, you are at the wrong place, instead you saw an inspired action piece with some political messages we should all hear. One tip: Watch and read the original first.",1
81," This was a great movie. Lots of symbology used in it. Though sadly a lot of the symbolism will go over most peoples heads. Lots of good references to todays world as well. Though be warned it doesn't take too kindly to religious extremes, especially Christian.",1
82," I really liked this movie--despite myself. I expected a dumbed down comic book adaptation (I'm so sick of comic book adaptations--is this the best Hollywood can come up with?) and was treated to a surprisingly thought-provoking and amazingy topical politcal tale. Great perfromances all around; Natalie Portman proves her multi-leveled ""Closer"" performance wasn't a fluke (and erases her cardboard ""Star Wars"" acting from memory once and for all). Critics may call the message of this film simplistic--but I'm thrilled to see a film aimed at a young demographic with any message at all besides ""wow, aren't these effects awesome?"". There's enough action to interest the MTV attention span generation, enough pyrotechnics to thrill the techno geeks, and most important, enough cautionary tale to resonate with those who actually have a brain in their head. A neat film with a wonderful mantra: People shouldn't fear their Government, the Government should fear the people.",1
83," Probably the greatest movie of the year thus far...even though not much has been released. A great film that goes a different route than what would be thought by the brothers who brought The Matrix Series. Good acting, good script. A fun and intelligent hero movie which doesn't involve super powers. A must see!!!",1
84," I found it interesting and and although I am a lefty, I didn't actually agree with all the politics side. I felt the ideas were made with rather broad strokes. However policital fiction has always taken the situation to the extreme as a method of analysing them - Animal Farm, 1984,Gulliver's travels, Swift's modest proposal for dealing with the Irish famine. I think maybe this should be a double billing with Ghandi just to balance things out a bit. Anyone who feels that TV had to much of a prevelance should watch/read Noam Chomsky's manufacturing consent, before deciding how much our lives are dictated by the media. It was billed too much as a thriller and I hate the fact they showed Big Ben blowing up in the trailer talk about giving the ending away!",1
85," A great movie, for people who didn't read the novel, and amazing visuals for those who did. Gritty & good.",1
86," Truly brilliant. Great acting, a superb story and themes.",1
87," Its the first of its kind. I gave it a 9 because i was moved by it. Not because i thought any of this could become a reality, but simply V himself and his enigmatic history, and the power and intellect he posseses. V is not a servant of the people like other heroes, he is one driven by a vendetta hence creating a highly unique movie.",1
88," This was a good comic book film with good plot and, unusually for such films, an intelligible script. But why do people want serious political messages from such a genre? Some have compared it with 1984 and Brave New World. This is just sad. Obviously it could be better (so could everything) but there are some good touches: the use of a 16/17th century Catholic terrorist as a symbol of modern freedom was nicely ironic, whilst the vision of thousands of Guy Fawkes attending the destruction of the Houses of Parliament was very good indeed (I am English by the way).",1
89,"An intriguing political thriller, with a touch of Matrix gloss. I miss the Matrix trilogy's action, but this movie has a greater focus on its moral and societal ideals, a focus so great that the whole movie just encapsulates you. Makes you think we REALLY need a hero like V, with a revolt to match. A few problems, though:1) V using torture to covert Portman? Feels a bit morally incoherent and pro-totalitarian, contradictory to the movie's goal. Offended me a little.2) Action a bit light in supply, probably due to a constrained $50 million dollar budget, where as the Matrix reloaded had $127 million at its disposal. They do the best with what they have, though. And it's unlikely that rich studio execs would heap $120+ million on a film that preaches politics that threaten to cut their wealth, anyway.",1
90," This is an amazing film, great characters, lots of action, but at times it is also very dark and political, and even humourous at times. You will like the characters in this film, especially V, who is impossible not to like.",1
91," Future situation, with a very good plot. Good performance by Natalie Portman. Hate 'Matrix' scenes in the movie...",1
92, I love this film. Brilliance.,1
93, The explosive V for Vendetta is powered by ideas that are not computer-generated. It's something rare in Teflon Hollywood: a movie that sticks with you. I enjoyed it!,1
94," I thought the movie was very powerful and extremely moving. Sure, the villains are evil to the extreme. There are very few subtle shades to be found - but it suits the story. The final moments are glorious.",1
95," The look of the film is excellent---visually they did a pretty magnificent job. The intentional verbosity works really well in many scenes--but sometimes faulters. The story, though I haven't read the original Alan Moore graphic novel, is ballsy to say the least (given the time of release) And Hugo and Natalie were fantastic. But I wouldn't judge this as some sort of call to arms in reality. The point being, all gov'ts can lead to fascism--and complacency among the populace is usually at the root. They also make some pretty good points about ""terrorism"" or rebellion---(namely when/where it's born and how similar it is to its creator) as well as media control-- none of it happens in a vacuum---or by coincidence. The action in the film is intermitten by some pretty long character scenes--but the FX fits well & by no means is as gratuitous as the #2 & #3 matrix films. It's definitely a film to be enjoyed in the theater (matinee prices anyway).",1
96," Gloriously overstuffed, daring adaptation of the classic graphic novel. Some fans of that may take issue with the changes made but I found they made the film a dystopia for our times. The actors inhabit their roles with panache and depth, with special credit going to Hugo Weaving for giving V character and emotional depth with no use of facial expressions. Natalie Portman will astonish anyone who's questioned her ability in the past. Yes, the accent falters, but the characterization does not. The film veers tonally all over the place and at times tries to do too many things at once but for the most part it is slyly subversive, rousing entertainment. Don't let the handwringing reactionaries or pseudointellectual elitists who have condemned this film prevent you from seeing it. You won't be able to get it and the myriad ideas it instigates out of your head.",1
97," Normally I don't give such high scores to movies, but this one without-a-doubt, deserves it. It got everything it wanted to be right, and had everyone walk away with a message. I haven't seen a movie with such a moving story in years and so well presently. We always know who to count on for incredible epic films, The Wachowski brothers. I could say so much more, but the film speaks for itself.",1
98, This is not a pro-terrorism movie. Read your John Locke.,1
99," Amazing movie; brilliant concept, wonderful acting, intelligent, clever, and thought provoking. If this movie does nothing for you then I'm sad to say you're amongst the lemmings of this country; blinded by this sick government we currently live under. Oh, and to the user who said ""Civil Wars in the American Midwest? Oh yeah.. That's gonna happen.""..yes, because an American Civil War is just so unlikely...I mean, it's not like we had one in the PAST or anything, right? [Ed: in the Midwest?]",1
100, This was an excellent film. It captures the heart of the revolutionary and makes you full of what is needed to make this world all the better. I'll definitely see this again.,1
101," One of the most thoroughly satisfying movie experiences I've had in a long time. It entertains, it's beautifully made, well writtien,has something real to say about the world we live in, and doesn't cop out of it's convictions like so much Hollywood fare. It also does not rely on special effects for it's entertainment value. Where effects are used they are top notch, and the sequence towards the end of the film is easily the best sequence of it's kind that I have ever seen on film. I hope this movie finds a huge audience.",1
102,"This movie is really good. i've read the comic book, and that was obviously better, but the film is great in its own right. this is the best thing i've seen in a long time, and it makes you think about a lot of things that's going on right now. yes, it may be controversial because it talks about terrorists and maybe even glorifying them, but hello, it's a film. it's fiction. it's only a portrayal of what alan moore (or whoever wrote the script) feels or thinks or whatever. i just want to complain about a few things: where was the vicious cabaret? or rose almond? i wish they concentrated a bit more on the outside characters and made it an ensemble drama (maybe there wasn't enough time, iunno)more than concentrating on natalie portman's iffy character. i never really liked evey anyway, but maybe that's just my opinion. watch it. its compelling stuff.",1
103," This was very good film! Unless you are a ultra conservative republican who would have great troubles understanding this film, this was very well written movie about a deeply flawed Hero adn heroine in a deeply flawed time. If,however, you are a moderate you will truly enjoy this film. It highlights the dangers of 'over-government', media manipulation, the problem of defining a terorist and many other issues very real and pertintant to today's world. I have read many review about this film harping on it 'glorifying terrorism' and for those who think it does, they have missed the points of the film altogether. The hero is a deeply flawed almost anti-hero who takes revenge on those who have destroyed his life and killed many that he has considered comrades by their circumstance being the same as his own. His revenge is mixed with his ideas of changing the world and become convoluted beggintg the question to be asked on what is justice and what is revenge and whether murder is justified. I have seen other reviewers saying it is attacking America, and yet the story is based in England about an English government. Yes, America is mentioned but it is not the focus. Very clearly, and on many occasions the storyline follows the basic premise: the people get the government they deserve either by action or inaction. The hero belives he will be able to stir the country to make choices again by removing the fear that has paralyzed them. A fantastic film that deserves discussion.",1
104," Thought the comic is better, I have to say I was extremly impressed with the film. Very moving, just like the book; I wept openly in the theater.",1
105," WOW, I have not seen a movie this great in a long time. Usually when I walk into a movie expecting it to be an action packed blockbuster, and its not.... I usually leave disappointed. Not in this case. The story is incredible, the few but powerful action scenes are incredible, and Hugo Weaving as V..... I don't think this movie could've been done without him. I loved him as Mr. Smith but... this gives a new meaning to acting. How anyone can show expression and emotion without facial movement is beyond me, but Weaving does it...and it is incredible. Great Job to the brothers, great job to Weaving, and great job to Natalie Portman, as this is going down as one of my all time favorite movies. FYI, it is political, but its not hurting anybody though The government is a dictorial leadership and V is a ""terrorist"". Everyone has a different perspective on this aspect. I see it this way, when America broke free and revolted against England, it was heroic and for the good of a free nation. When V Terrorizes the government and sucks the people into his beliefs against a monarchy.... what is the difference, its not a terrorist act if it leads to a happy ending right. Anything that is heroic in our history books was just a glorified terrorist act that became a fight for our rights. Great Movie, Great Action, Great Acting. Favorite movie of the year so go see it.",1
106," I see some 75 movies a year in theatres and V for Vendetta is by far the most exhilerating and compelling piece of movie magic I have seen in at least the past year. The acting was incredible and pitch-perfect and the visuals were stunning. The fact that V was carrying out his personal vendetta while trying to save his country only made him all the more human. As excelent example as I have ever seen of Margaret Mead's statement to never doubt that a small group of committed and concerned citizens can change the world, in fact is is the only thing that ever has. V and Elie were those citizens.",1
107," Amazing movie. Amazingly different and refreshing. I wish there would be more movies like this. It's a long movie but not a boring in anyway, even with not that much action. But when the action kicks in its really satisfying. Bad guys really are bad guys in this movie, and this movie reminds you how evil humans can be against each other. People should not hate this movie just because of its message or lack there of.",1
108," A stunning achievement, not only for Natalie Portman, but for all movies with a politcal premise...Gosh it's great.",1
109," Awesome movie! It makes you think about everything and you will not know all the answers until the end of the movie truly bringing it full circle. I've heard the arguments about V being a terrorist, think about this in the US what did they do when they were oppressed back in 1776? Thats right they became terrorists in a sense but they did not try to stamper or control the ideas of other countries like what happened on 9-11. This is a story about citizens taking back their rights from an opressive government and it beheave you to keep this in mind when you see it ""What would I do if a government told me what I can and can not do while they do it all?""",1
110," Seriously, its one of the best movies i'd seen in a long long while. One of the most memorable films ever seen. And trust me, i've seen LOTS of movies and am pretty jaded by trash these days. Go read the better critic reviews. They got it right this time.",1
111," I went to this movie, looking for entertainment and found it. Not just some sleazy chick flick that has a pre-written format for content but something that made me think deeply about government and people. The dialogue was amusing, and I absolutely loved Portman. The backround information was sketchy at best and the reason for blowing up parliament vague and more left to the imagination than anything. The movie has faults but I believe that there are movies that have a less entertainment value given good reviews than a movie that requires you think and believe in something more being harped upon because of politics. When I want to watch a movie, I check my politics at the door.",1
112," I could go on with a lengthy speach about this movie, but after reading other peoples reviews, I feel that i cant do this movie justice without someone else contradicting my opinion about how this movie portrayed ""politics"". Its a freaking movie, for god sakes who cares how the politics are handled in the future of a COMIC BOOK! Just go see the movie.",1
113," The premise behind the film was excellent, sadly the film was to be foud lacking generally. The plot is sluggish and is far too choppy and the way the back story is weaved in takes away form the the current action (of which there is'nt half enough anyway). When the the action scenes happened they were good especially the ending knife sequence whch is worth the ticket entry alone.",1
114," Instead of portraying what the world (or more precisely, the American government) is like today, this movie warns of what it could become if people were to blindly follow the orders of today's leaders. It is a comparison between this future government and the government the Nazi party imposed on countries they conquered. It is also a tribute to Guy Fawkes and the power of symbolism. And the knife-play is excellent.",1
115," i have yet to see a better, more intruiging movie to date. V for Vendetta is now my #1 favorite movie not because of the action or the good acting, but because of how real this movie seemed. V for Vendetta was one of those movies that felt like it could very well happen. and, if you look closely at history, it sort of all has already happened. its definitely not one of those non-stop action flicks, but the action it does have is well done, with some very nice special effects. i HIGHLY recommend it. however: don't go into this movie expecting to understand every aspect. history buffs will pick up on a lot of the symbolizms, but the casual movie goer might not enjoy this one as much.",1
116," What a great movie! Everything i like about it has been said by other people but was anyone else really dissapointed by Natalie Portman's performance? I really liked her in star wars, closer and garden state but what happend to her in this movie?",1
117," A satisfyingly potent mix of classics 1984 and Farenheit 451, with a touch of Equilibrium. A thinking movie I will have to watch on DVD so I can catch all the details and famous quotes.",1
118," Very strong movie. Suprisingly, it was more of an intellectual exercise than an action movie or an emotional experience. This is perhaps the lone weakness of the movie - there are a couple of times where a more emotional wallop would have moved this movie to a 10. Otherwise, I found myself sucked into the story. Unlike a lot of other futuristic, totalitarian movies, the progression from here (the present) to there (the nightmarish future) was extremely believable.",1
119,"""One of the best movies I've seen in a while"". - I actually said that to my girlfriend as I was walking out of the theater.  And I was referring to any new movie that's been released. IMO, better than Capote, Crash, or any other Oscar nominee from last year (DEFINITELY better than Brokeback Mountain).  It's kind of a long movie but it held my interest until the end.  Go see it!",1
120, Excellent movie with a strong message. One can not ask for a better movie.,1
121, One of the best films I have ever seen.,1
122, Best movie I've seen in a long time. Intellectual and riveting. A smart movie with lots of action.,1
123, very good plot and lots of action.,1
124," Great movie! Great story and they presented it, I think, perfectly. A good action movie, with ""matrix-like"" elements, and a story that makes you think. Resembles WW2 nazi Germany. Natalie Portman was great too.",1
125, It was better to me than the Matrix. It was very political but it was played very well. I think the letter scene could have been done better.,1
126," In a country filled with ""sheep""; I think this film was an excellent way to deliver a very pointed warning about the fear mongering and wars that are used to influence public opinion and line the pockets of the wealthy.",1
127," V was a very good film, anyone giving it less than a 7, not only came in midway through the film, but is over critical of the great performances given by Portman and Weaving.",1
128," This movie IS thought provoking. Many critics caught up in the rush to elitism brand this as oversimplistic, shallow, and irresponsible. I am delighted to have an alternative to ""The Hills Have Eyes 5"" and ""Saw 12"" Evidently some critics wouldn't know shallow, and irresponsible if it bit them on the ass.",1
129," One of the best, if not THE best movie, I have ever seen. Perfect blend of action and philosophy and politics.",1
130," One of my favorite movies. I understand why some didn't enjoy this movie, but for me everything really came together. The story may be ""juvenile"" in terms of politics, but maybe it needs to be so that more people can understand it. Moving, and politically motivating. Take the chance if you are on the edge, it really is phenomenal.",1
131, Love this movie. I suspect all the people that hated it get their news from Limbaugh and O'Riley.,1
132," Great movie, great action, and many philosophical ideas and concepts have been used to show us what a future world will look like. LOVE the ending, it can be translated and taken many different ways.",1
133, Please note the bad reviews are all based on poltical idealogy..are you really suprised? The critic for the New Yorker is an idiot and a tool...go ahead and listen to him if your idea of a good time is what passes for culture in the bowels of the rag he writes for. Totally ridiculous.,1
134, I just saw the sneak preview tonight... Once again we have to hand it to the Wachowski brothers for collaborative efforts in reproducing this great story into film... Expect a STELLAR performance by Hugo Weaving (V). The performance by Natalie Portman is more skillful than we have seen in the past (Lightyears past Star Wars). You should find the grammatically enhanced script during V's alley introduction scene most enjoyable... :) I rate this film two thumbs up!,1
136," I just saw this last night and really liked it. V was so well done by Hugo Weaving that the mask he was wearing was not disctracting at all. Natalie Portman did very good after about half way through. I was a little pissed that they cut off some of the books elements, but the overall message was clear. One thing I did like more than the book was V and Evey's relationship with one another. I think it was more fully realized than what Moore wrote. It added an emotional element to the movie that it might not have had otherwise. It isn't as action packed as one might expect from the trailer, but the book wasn't either. When there is action though, it is highly stylized and very well done. The last scene of the movie in Trafalgar Square is breathtaking. This is a political movie first, action movie second but I feel it will appeal to a lot of people. In fact, this does have cult film written all over it. Good job Wachowski's, you have redeemed yourselves (at least in my opinion).",1
137,"The movie is not as good as it's source material, but how often does that happen. It was thought provoking and affecting. Very good movie.",1
138," This is not a perfect film. But it does something that no other film has done in a very long time. It matters. People can, and will, dismiss the film and its message. It is a call not for revolution, but for living, for true freedom. The similarities between the movie and real life (i.e. crazy people ""taking"" power, massive lies to keep a government in power) are all the more interesting knowing the comic was based on the experience of the Thatcher administration and not Bush II. The source does not matter, the movie reminds us, or at least me, that living in fear is not living at all, and that real life involves tackling your own fears. It could just be me, but even if it is, this movie made me think, and that matters.",1
139," Very entertaining sci-fi effort. The highest praise i can give a film is ""i will buy it the first day it's out on DVD"". And I will. Portman is quite good here, but Weaving is absolutely fantastic. Even with a mask on, you can't keep this guy from dominating a film. The dialogue is topnotch. Can't say enough good things about this movie.",1
140," Like the Matrix, this film plays brilliantly to a society caught between fascination with technology and fear of its evolving use in enforcing political control. In V, just as in that earlier work, the Wachowskis offer an unrealistic savior who magically cuts through the web of manipulation without ever dirtying his hands in the only thing that has ever really subverted control: organizing popular political movements. It certainly takes chutzpah in our present environment to put forward as a hero a character who blows up buildings in order to bring down a totalitarian state. Although I don't buy that vision as either practical or desirable, this is nonetheless a spectacular piece of visionary art. Like all good art, it gives us an alternative lens through which to examine our own reality; the choice of which aspects of that vision should be pursued, and which ought to be rejected, remains with us. While the film's ""solution"" is facile and unrealistic, and therefore ultimately unchallenging, its depiction of the totalitarian malaise and its unholy alliance of coercive force and media manipulation echoes, and in many ways meaningfully updates, the prophetic and ever more relevant work of George Orwell in ""1984."" It is good to see a work of this depth in a popular medium. Just don't let its violent bromide distract you from what really needs to be done. Get out there *now* and organize against the corporate domination of every facet of life that draws us to films like this one that meaningfully reflect and explicate that present bitter reality.",1
141, A more thought provoking film than most Hollywood drivel.,1
142," Visually stunning and imaginative. I was worried when I learned that the author of the comic book asked to have his name removed from the film, but I have to say that they truly pulled it off. The only issue I had was watching Hugo Weaving genuflecting in his costume, but that's forgivable when the hero is wearing a theater mask.",1
143," I truly enjoyed this movie. It is a visually stunning, clever and fun political commentary and adventure. V is an extraordinary rebel--he seeks revenge and teachs enlightenment. Wonderful film.",1
144,"Exhilarating story, directing, and acting. I loved Natalie's performance a lot. If you can catch this at an IMAX, buy your ticket for the next showing now!!!",1
145, This is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Everything about it was perfect. Natalie Portman was great and so was Hugo Weaving as V. They make an unlikely pair. I just hope they don't make a crappy sequel and ruin it.,1
146," Wonderfully executed, memorable film. Natalie Portman does a good job, but I was even more impressed with Hugo Weaving. The way he gives the mask life with only the subtle move of his head or his body language is truly impressive. As many have said, it truly sticks with you. Highly recommended!!",1
147," As a controversial political thriller, it pretty much is average. As a kick ass view of the future with an eloquent terrorist wearing a kick ass mask, this is the most entertaining movie i've seen in a long time. Bravo!!",1
148," Best eyecandy film I've seen this year so far. Please note that none of the READER REVIEWS up to this point mention the GRAPHIC by Lloyd and an Un-credited by choice Moore. One word for the others. Bollocks. Hellblazer had a decent movie spin and V also gets its just due. It really is a credit to Alan Moore that his themes and characterization still stand to make relevant theatrical releases some 20 years after its publication as comic media. The filmakers of V deserve credit for translating the same feel to motion picture. It is unfortunate that the original author has distanced himself from this release. Rodriguez's Sin City was to Frank Miller what Vendetta appears to be for Alan Moore. Mr Moore please embrace the mainstream exposure before WATCHMEN becomes the DaVINCI CODE, when it should be HOLY BLOOD HOLY GRAIL of comic films. After WATCHMEN comics were about as interesting as EPISODES I, II, and III after the original trilogy. And I read WATCHMEN when I was 13. Who else but luke and leia's moms could be this santized version of e-V-ey? Rhea excellent as always playing the out-of-the-loop englishman. My only quips are the jolly ending and the 'abduction' of evey sequence that I didn't particularly care for in the maxi-series either. Only Sean Bean as V could have made for a better film, but there is always NiteOwl II.",1
149," A very good film, I don't know what they could've done to make it much better. I absolutely love the book, and this movie is a great adaptation. People complain because it doesn't answer anything, and it's not suppose to. V for Vendetta is very uncompromising tale that asks questions, and leaves it up to you to think about the morality of using violence to solve issues among many other things. I just give it a point off because I thought the ending of the novel was much more believable than in the movie. If you read, pay attention to what goes on in the world, and are not turned off by some violence then go see this movie. If you watch Reality TV [Ed: huh?], voted for Bush or listen to Creed, stay at home.",1
150," Is certain to spark debate among people of both party lines. It's importance in subject manner is equal to it's ability to entertain. I haven't seen a movie with as many instantly classic movie moments since the Matrix. Examples: the opening monologue by V, V taking over the news studio and his message to the masses, The domino scene and the momentum it builds to the climax, and Parliament going up in flames to the backdrop of the 1812 overture. This movie will suprise many going into it expecting a dumb comic book adaptation. Bravo to everyone involved in bringing this to the big screen. I doubt I'll see a better movie all year.",1
151," The comparison of this future Biritain to Nazi's works since the government gains power by releasing biological weapons on their own people. This movie finds a nice balance between the personal stories dotting the story landscape and the big picture of politics and history. All while not going too far into the politics (like a Lucas film might). The action scenes were generally the weakest pieces, but were also few. Good job by the Wachowskis.",1
152," Possibly the best film of the year by far, a true achievement in enthralling storytelling and a cast which delivered some of their best individual performances yet. Remember, remember, the fifth of november. It's not one that you're ever gonna forget.",1
153, Excellent and memorable.,1
154," As a fan of Alan Moore and the original mini-series comic book, I'm surprised this movie captured the heart of the source material. We're getting mixed reviews because this is an action movie with subversive themes--that aren't quite black or white, for that matter. If you watch this simply AS an action picture alone, you'll be bored by all the debate and back story. If you watch this merely AS a political film, it's too flat and muddled (V is not clearly the hero or the villain--he's both and he's neither). So instead, watch the movie itself as what it is. As such, it's exciting, interesting, at times even moving. Leave your genre expectations at the door to assist in seeing this for what it's worth.",1
155,"Absolutely fantastic film...despite the fact its advertised as an action movie, theres really very little action in it an i didnt even notice..this movie is doing just what it set out to do, stimulating both positive an negetive opinions, an sparking discussion..i'll take that anyday over the same old crap hollywood spews out on a regular basis to rake in profits..i highly recommend this movie for anyone with half a brain.",1
156," An entertaining, engaging movie that only dragged a couple of times. ""V"" is far more enjoyable than almost all of the comic book/graphic novel adaptations that have been released in the past five years. See this on the big screen while you can - it's well worth the time.",1
157," After listening to Jonathan Ross slate the movie as ""a complete mess"" and ""nothing but nothing works"" I decide to find out for myself and to be honest I can see his point. The movie has its problems the dialogue is terrible a superhero who likes to qoute shakespeare when kicking ass just does not work,and there could have been better action,the positives were the hijack of the media building where we see some interesting scenes and the end fight scene in the tunnel,to call it a complete disaster is a little harsh,it does have some positive points just the pretentious poetic verses are weak and pointless,interesting if undramatic.",1
158," Probably the best feature I ever seen! Good job, K.",1
159, V for Vendetta is a great look into one of the many possiable futures we face. More then anything V offers an entertaining look at what is possiable when one person decides to take a stand against a seemingly unbeatable opressor. V looks deeply into how freedom is can be taken away slowly and leaves the characters wondering when things really changed. I enjoyed the film and suggest it not just because it is a currently relevent film but because of its entertainment value.,1
160, This was an entertaning film. The visual style was unique. And it really opens your eyes to what is going on in the world right now. Fear is power. All that noise. I have to say while pepole are going goo- ga ga for Natalie Portman and her shaved head. I have to send out props to Hugo Weaving who even though you cant see him while wearing that mask he still manages to capture you and draw you into the story. The acting from this particular actor was nothing more then excellence. If you go to see this movie . go see it for Hugo 's acting alone. Good fun. Couple of minor flaws. but i can deal with them.,1
161," Quite a good see, even if a bit controversial. Intriguing vision of extreme politicians striking fear into the hearts of the citizens, but not unrealistic in parts. Was annoyed by the long scenes without changing to another set of characters.",1
162," Pros: Hugo Weaving provides excellent range to a character concealed by a mask, especially with respect to his fantasy fencing, posturing during dramatic sequencies and reasonable voice work. The atmosphere, although stereotypic with respect to V's lair, did well to compliment the characters' fear of the fingermen, electronic surveillance and the constant potential for abduction, reminiscent of Brazil. Despite Alan Moore's discontent, the movie respects the graphic novel's mythology with respect to V's identity as an idea and Evey's transformation into a less fearful, more participatory dissent. Con's: [***SPOILERS***] The fall of Sutler at the very end was cheap and easy. The fact that he was so protected throughout the film and was easily kidnaped by his own cabal was a little hard to swallow. The ending was rushed and made easy to wrap up a 2.5 hour film. The evil would have been better developed with more detail and background story about Larkland. We don't see V become V. We don't see how he makes the transition from burned victim of a fire to a superhero. Developing a number of victims of Larkland so that we knew them, before their deaths and/or transformation to V. While we don't see who it is, feeling for all of them would have been more powerful.",1
163," I liked the 1984 connection. John Hurt was the last person to play Winston Smith in a production of Orwell's, 1984. Could they make the film in the U.S? I think self censorship would have prevented it.",1
164," Art and film make up fictions to reveal the truth, whereas politicians make up lies to conceal the truth: this brilliant film, sort of a cross between a Michael Moore documentary and George Orwell's 1984, demontsrates this difference beautifully. Based on a comic book, its made-up fiction is naturally over-the-top. But the truths it thereby reveals are so important, they make the inevitable exaggeration of the genre worthwhile.",1
165,Best movie so far this year!,1
166," Was it great? No. Was it good? Yes! There have been better tellings of this tale, but none that I've enjoyed more on the big screen. One problem with such diverse and deep material is that it's hard to expand on every single tangent. In this story, you have concurrently being told the history of the last 30 something years of the world, the personal back stories of the two main protagonists, the personal backstories of the main antagonist and two of his henchmen, a number of heavy general concepts - social injustice, political oppression, justice vs revenge, liberalism vs conservatism, terrorists vs freedom fighters, resurrection of the spirit, god vs man, and the minor issues of childhood development in the abscence of parents, the long-term effects of torture on the psyche, and how many obscure references to Shakespear can you squeeze into a movie without losing your non-literary audience. To touch on so many subjects without losing focus on the story, becoming mawkish or predictible, or appealing to the lowest common Hollywood denomenator is an admirable feat. Movies of this calibre have to pander *slightly* to the masses if they want to make a profit. This is reality. Too much action at the expense of a story, and you risk getting laughed at. To much intellectualism at the expense of action, and you end up with people walking out of the theater, yawning or scratching their heads (I know people who hated the first hour of the Matrix, but loved the second.) Granted, there were some predictable scenes. We all knew she had been ""kidnapped"" by V, and if she had come out of it the same person, the whole segment would have been pointless. But, that was the fire-walk for her, and even though they beat us over the head with the visual imagery, the segment was necessary. The ending was predictible as well, but from the beginning we already KNEW what was going to happen at the end. That didn't mean we didn't want to see each and every explosive frame. Movies, if they are thoughtful and visually interesting, can afford a little predictability. The first Batman wasn't particularly deep, but the futuristic art deco landscape kept your eyes glued to the screen, and distracted you from the simplistic plot. Both Batman and V for Vendetta followed the same rule - there's no such thing as safe advertising. Books rely on the reader to envision the author's creation. Movies adapted from books present the viewer with one persons vision, perhaps quite different from their own, and this can be disconcerting. That doesn't make it wrong. Film is also a time-limited medium. It's often taken for granted that people reading a book can spend as much, or as little time as they like combining details and narrative in order to visualize the author's workd. It's a trade-off, and one of the reasons it's so difficult to adapt books to movies. I read Star Wars a year before I saw the film, and while some things in the film came across seemlessly, others were totally unsettling. From reading the book, my perception of droids was quite different from what I saw on screen. I also got the impression that the space battle at the end was much longer then what I saw in the film. This was no doubt a consequence of those expensive 1970's special effects. There were many places where V for Vendetta could have taken a wrong turn, and ended up down a dead end, but didn't. For example, imagine if Natale Portman HAD, (in the typically cliched Hollywood fashion) taken off V's mask and kissed his scarred face! We'd have all run screaming from the theater, ""noooooo!"" Thank goodness they didn't do it. It was far more moving, to see her kiss the mask, and have to imagine his awkward reaction behind it. Since I've never read the book, I can't comment on how V for Vendetta stands as an adaptation, but as a film on its own, it stands up quite well. It's good fare, but not great, and nowadays, with all the cookie-cutter crud out there, I think a movie like this has to be forgiven a little, especially if it makes you think while entertaining you.",1
167," Awesome movie. Fast moving, intelligent. Brilliant character development.",1
168, Strikes the delicate balance of being honest and hopeful at the end. A fine piece of filmmaking.,1
169," I'm a little suprised by the negative reviews. I thought, for the most part, the film was about as close an adaptation of the graphic novel as you could get (except for the ending). And while the acting may have been poor and the film far from earth-shattering, the story did show how totalitarian governments start. People who live in fear, apathy, and/or anger, trust their leaders to get revenge or take back what is ""theirs."" The lies begin and that is the beginning of the end. Is the U.S. on a similar path? Hardly. Conservatives may bristle at the allusions to Bush and Iraq but I saw more Stalinism, fascism and the novel,1984, than the War on Terror, which is what the graphic novel was depicting (in 1982 no less). The filmmakers added those elements for contemporary reasons. I am surprised that so often Conservatives and the religious-right always feel like they have to shout down the opposing view or defend their position even in a movie review. Relax, it's just a movie!",1
170,"Very well done and definitely not your typical 'hero.""",1
171," In the battle of allegorical movies about our current administration, I think V for ""The Village"" wins, but Natalie Portman's bald head and John Hurt's role reversal(in reference to the Orwell novel, and the Bush-hatin' doc ""Orwell Rolls in his Grave"") entertained me enough to ignore the occasional bombast of its politics. Hurt, in imitation of the fuhrer, reminded me of Robert F. Kennedy's appearance of Hannity and Colmes, in which the environmental attorney compared Bush to Hitler. And Portman, late in the film, you half-expect her to wail, ""I don't know no shame/I feel no pain/I can't,"" as if channeling the Sinnead O'Connor persona that produced ""Mandinka"". Unlike her ""Star Wars"" stint, Portman doesn't look overwhelmed by the spectacle, looking equally comfortable in a police state as she did in ""Garden State"".",1
172," Very good, subversive mix of history and comic book action.",1
173, This is a terrific film released into a challenging time. Bravo to the producers and Warner Bros. for having the guts to release it. The safe money is on the tried and tame and this is not what you will see here. You will leave the theater with a desire to talk about the ideas and images presented.,1
174," I don't like action movies,but liked the first Matrix film as well as Batman begins. I saw this film in the hope that it may be similar to the films mentioned, and was not disappointed. Visually, moreover, it is nothing short of delicious.",1
175, Hey Kel R.... You do realize this is a movie right? Go suck George Bush off some where else. Comparing this movie to the Democrates is like comparing Brokeback Mt. to the Republicans. Anyways it's a descent film folks. It's entertaining.,1
176,Strong statement about society's limited ability to recognize the process of corruption; resistance and martyrs impact on familly members; well dramatized! Identification with Evey and the Security Chief makes this movie commanding. Outstanding...Portman takes the center and carries it well!,1
178," If you're not into thinking, this moving isn't for you. While watching this moving, you have a choice: to view it as a movie version of a comic book (as you would Superman or Batman or Spiderman) or to view it as a chilling commentary on the American experience related to 9/11 and the Bush Administration. When will we stop allowing fear to be used to control us? ""The only thing to fear is fear itself.""",1
179, I thought this was a thought provoking movie with plenty of action and humor to go around. Audiences will either love it or hate it in the first 2 minutes. If you enjoyed fight club then I highly recommend this film.,1
180,"In the vein of Orwell's 1984. If you have any respect for that book's message you will feel this film's depth.If you didnt like V because you felt it was poking at your political beliefs then you must have some seriously sensitive and messed up allegiances to certain fascist hate groups. This is entertainment people, take a breath and watch it. I applaud the film for actually going against the grain of so much hollywood drivel.  It dares to raise quesitons! Vital questions. But maybe you would rather not leave your Fox News bubble. If you are ready to take the red pill go get enlightened at democracynow.org",1
181," I thought this was a great movie overall. I have read the Graphic Novel recently and found that some minor details were changed, but very few of them put me off. The graphic novel is a little bit anticlimatic, but the movie is not.",1
182," It goes without saying that the action scenes created by the Wachowski brothers are phenomenal. The dialogue is captivating and, as in the matrix, deeply existenial and philosophic. The references to our current political situation are ample, add depth, but are deeply disturbing. Anyone on the Chistian Right will be deeply offended.",1
184," While it doesn't follow the comic to a T, most of what was left out was due to time. There were a few changes, although some were fairly big. All in all, it does remain fairly faithful, and still makes for a great movie. One of my favorite comic movies to date. For those complaining about it not being new, and just is rehashing things from a post 9/11 world, well, the story was around way before hand. Alan Moore started Writing it in 1983, and it was released in comic form in 1988, plus there had been people trying to make a movie of it for quite a few years (the same with Moore's Watchmen). The events of 9/11 probably delayed the production of this movie, not inspired it! Evey and V didn't really have a traditional love affair as some are pushing. It was more emotional that lust, due to the ideals V has. Some of the people rating totally didn't undersand that (such as one saying ""Portman's character finds the burnt dude in the mask sexy? C'mon!""). If you've read the comic, and it was also brought up in the movie, for a while she was thinking V was her father! I don't know about you, but people typically don't lust after father figures [Ed- Apparantly never watched or heard of Phantom of the Opera].",1
185," V for Vendetta was a great film, it wasn",1
186," V for Vendetta is a killer movie- far too awesome at nearly two and a half hours, with round, clean visuals, smooth editing and awareness of urgency. But as a political work, it's something else - light-handed and flat-out smart.",1
187, Fantastic! Love the movies from start to finish! Go see it!,1
189, A great movie. Anyone who likes comics like the watchmen (alan moore) will love this movie.,1
190,"*Anyone giving this movie anything below a 7 should be put into ",1
191," Compelling and moving. Maybe it hits too close to home for some, who would rather ignore the parallels with today's politcal climate.",1
192," Crazily ambitious, overstuffed, yet utterly compelling mixture of comic book action, dystopian sci-fi, and left-wing agitprop set in a near-future when Britain is once again the world's preeminent superpower after the United States' failed foreign policies and a disastrous war in the Middle East (where do they get this stuff???) have left it in a state of civil war. This future Britain is run with an iron fist by a dictator (John Hurt) who uses religious bigotry, homophobia, and fear of terrorism to hold sway over the populace, except for a mysterious masked avenger known only as V (Hugo Weaving), who sets out on a violent campaign against the powers that be, including a plot to blow up Parliament. Natalie Portman (shaved head, Brit accent, and all) is excellent as Evey, reporter for a right-wing TV network, who is saved by V then drafted into his plans. The script by the Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix), based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore (From Hell), has many influences; 1984, of course, but also Alphaville, Fahrenheit 451, Phantom of the Opera, Batman, and The Count of Monte Cristo (the Robert Donat version is V's favorite film) among others. What's particularly ballsy here is how this especially nasty future is simply a logical extension of all the worst elements of today's real-life political climate (from Fox News to bird flu paranoia), and how the hero of a big-budget post-9/11 mass entertainment is essentially a sympathetic terrorist. The vivid art direction, heavily influenced by Nazi and Communist iconography, is Oscar-worthy, and the supporting cast is aces, including Stephen Rea as a detective, Stephen Fry as a quietly rebellious gay man, and Roger Allam as a venom-spewing TV host so vile and reactionary he makes Rush, Hannity, and ""Falafel Guy"" O'Reilly seem measured and reasonable by comparison. The film is overlong and over-the-top in both good and bad ways, but it's kind of hard to complain too loudly about a movie that has too MANY ideas at a time when most wannabe thrillers (Firewall, anyone?) have none whatsoever.",1
193," Just a beautiful movie from the cinematographic point of view, it also made one ponder many things about government and a how bad it must be before it is right to use violence to stop it.",1
194," By far the best film I've seen in over a year. Thought provoking and controversial, backed up with exceptional acting. The film has a unique story line and brilliant characters!",1
195, Breath taking film best film seen in a long time.,1
196," Visually beautiful, with excellent actors and interesting plot. What I don't like is the fact that so many critics are looking at the story as criticism on today's society when it should be viewed in the 80's context as a statement on the inhumanity of the Thatcherist politics.",1
197," One word: Excellent. Strong message, great actors, wonderful scenes. I love it .",1
198, A must see for anyone concerned about our democracy.,1
199,"to Mr. RM: perhaps if you had finished watching this film instead of leaving to go home and get hard over SAW (clever, but stupidly violent movie) for the millionth time you may have been able to appreciate the depth of this film. The fact that you can: A) call it a dumb film without even seeing the end of it and B) classify anything as ""Dumb"" like a 5 year old would mearly proves that this film was not ""Dumn"" simply you are too simple minded and sadistic to understand it. I thought this was a great movie and is probably one of the only movies that has actually made me think about it beyond the cinema door.",1
200, I love that they have it so right. If the american governent continues it's way...controlling people with fear..this may become a reality.,1
201," Wonderful movie, makes you think!",1
202, Artistically rich with a unique protagonist. Though the ending is predictable the route taken to it isn't.,1
203, I have documented proof that Guy Fawkes wore a Hugo Weaving mask (just kidding). This was a very exciting movie. Hugo Weaving was fantastic even though his face was never seen. I don't think that the imbedded story about the Lesbian love affair adding anything essential to the plot. Neither did the slow-mo blood letting. The basic story itself made an excellent point about surrendering freedom under fear. It happened in Germany 70 years. I hope it never happens here.,1
204, It is about time - Finally a good movie worth watching and reminds me of curtain situations going on now....Thanks for making a good movie they are far and few.,1
205," Excellent as entertainment and spectacle. The political message is not a clear or particularly compelling one, given that the story requires Total Evil from one side. Still, an involving and in many ways eerily moving film.",1
206," This is first rate entertaiment. The kind of pop art that entertains, made us think and amuses us for its collection of ideas and unlimited imagery. James McTeigue´s first effort (of ""The Matrix"" gang) is just a big exercise of uncompromising fillmmaking. Its great to watch a film that masked in the label of action entertainment displays a powerful message of freedom. After see ""V for Vendetta"", everyone thinks about the responsability in the process of actual living: are we members of the mass? libertarians? opressors? what part we play? This is the kind of ideas that this unique film develops. With its message hidden in the form of standard thriller (with a bunch of symbolisms and philosophical reflections), ""V for Vendetta"" gives us, too, great pleasure to be distracted. This is not escapism, or, better, is the collection of anarchisms wrapped up in the way of escapism. ""V for Vendetta"" has a clear sense of Orwell and a thought about totalitarian regimes, but the great failure in the film is the waste of time to represent this ideas and make them ""swallowable"" to teenage audiences that watch the film as an action flick, so the whole intention of being incendiary is just forgotten by the masses that in the film are portrayed. But, what if only one person goes out of the cinema making an exercise of personal reflection about its own freedom? That doesn´t mean that someone could walk out of the Cineplex to make a bomb and blow up the Oval Office, but, just (and I think that is the only purpose of the movie) think about the part we play in this society. For a film that looks inicuous and not too big, that powerful message is a thing to get honored.",1
207, I believe this film is the first film in a long long time that has made me really think about my place in society....How far do we go to defend our rights as human beings?...How far do you go to save the lives of your fellow man?,1
208," Although based on a graphic novel, this is anything but a vapid action film. In fact, there is a stretch in the middle that deliberately moves quite slowly, but instead of being bored, I was drawn to its beauty and elegance. Combining politics, action, and intrigue, this is a new breed of film, and I hope they make more like it.",1
209, I enjoyed the film. Portmans performance is great but Hugo Weaving speaks to dramatically. It was as if V was trying to make himself sound dangerous and intelligent. Evey didn't seem to play an important part in the film but just stay around V and blow up the parliment for him. Nontheless the idea that V stresses speaks for itself.,1
211,"The 2006 movie V for Vendetta is an intelligent, action packed, political thrill ride. The movie is based on the David Lloyd graph novel. The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix) wrote the screen play and James McTeigue directed this great movie. V for Vendetta takes place in a near future Great Britain with a totalitarian regime in power. The theme that portrayed throughout the movie is that the people should not be afraid of their government, the government should be afraid of its people. The main character Evey Hammond (Nathalie Portman) is a working class woman who gets mixed up with the mysterious freedom fighter/terrorist known only as V. The man in the Guy Fox mask is played by Hugo Weaving (Mr. Smith in The Matrix). V wants nothing more than to topple the unjust and controlling totalitarian regime by any means necessary which brings up many ethical dilemmas throughout the movie. Symbolism is a huge part of the movie and is coupled with intelligent dialogue and allows for an intellectually rewarding experience. Nathalie Portman delivers a good acting performance and really goes all the way with shaving her head. Hugo Weaving delivers as well with the difficult situation of having to act without any facial expression and exclusively using tone of voice and hand gestures. Overall V for Vendetta satisfies your pallet for intelligent storyline, thrilling action sequences, and creative acting that keeps you engaged for the entire two hours of movie magic.",1
212, A very good movie with movie twists and suspenseful action,1
213," Very very impressive. Takes note of deeper issues unlike the other plotless, cutaneous movies that resort to overused plot devices.",1
214," A deeply flawed yet deeply beautiful movie. Its reach exceeds its grasp, and only scratches the surface of the problems, principles and conundrums it purports to engage with, but as a stirring visual poem on our occasional responsibility to be irresponsible, it satisfies and stirs. Don't expect to be challenged, but don't expect to be talked down to either. Personally I'm glad to see a story such as this given the pop culture treatment, and mercifully lose relatively little. The dialogue leaves much to be desired, but V's monologues are superb, and Weaving's ability to connect from behind a mask is commendable. My only real objection is that the Beautiful Lesbian Love Story gets ten glorious minutes, while the male-on-male Mapplethorpe pictures get all of three seconds from an obscure angle :) (Also, anyone who makes kneejerk references to this as ""liberal, leftist"" propaganda clearly doesn't know what either of those words mean, and would probably be the perfect constituent for the movie's dictator!).",1
215," Was an alright movie, not the best ever made but one I still dont mind watching. Also side note, but did anyone else notice a large amount of the negative reviews seem to be copy-pasted. I think this got freepered at one point.",1
216,"The voting tells you more about people than the film. The story is a powerful one showing a future in which right wing extremism goes well, to extremes. The rankings seem less about the movie more about the readers reaction to the consequences of extremism in the state. I did not find the plot that unbelieveable, rather a bit too close to reality for comfort. Plagues like that are conceivable. Medi manipulation like that is conceivble. And the masses well we were led after September 11th weren't we? The way it critises those who hate for race or religious reasons...I can well understand their reactions to this movie. Better a backlash against the movie rather than one at ourselves. 10. Its novel. Its clever. No other movie like it. ...but its definatly not Superman saves the world.",1
217," After reading the posts on the site, I felt inclined to put in my two cents. V was a fine movie, but as with any movie, it had flaws. The biggest flaw was Natalie Portman. She was poorly cast; the role seemed too big for her. The rest of the actors did an amazing job, especially Hugo Weaving even though you never see his face. The British actors did an excellent job, as they almost always do. The film has a fine plot, but it took entirely too much depth out of the novel. The film could have been about half an hour longer and been much better. What is very interesting about the story is that despite being written more than twenty years ago, it remains relevant today. Although not as good as it could have been, it is definitely worth watching. A mature audience which is not letting its political biases cloud its judgments will enjoy the film for what it is: a good action film, with a quality story.",1
218," This is the one film i have ever seen, that has taken a comic, altered it and come out with a good result at the end, the changes are subtle to make the film better, judging by the low reviews from ""professional"" American critics it is obvious they don't appreciate the subtle intelligence that Alan Moore wove into the original story, ""people should not be afraid of their government, governments should be afraid of their people"".",1
219," Not faithful to the graphic novel. i understand why Alan Moore might be upset. However, not a bad movie either. It's not stupendous, but for a commercial movie it shows a lot of guts (no pun intended). Very brave movie. I suggest people to see the movie first the read the comic afterwards or you may discriminate the former. Hugo Weaving shines as ""V"" even though you never see his face. He is the most faithful one to his chacter and not even Mr. Moore can dismiss that.",1
221, Worth watching. Better then the comic book. My girlfriend wanted to see it again.,1
222, An important movie on spiritual awakening and living in the Truth and Power of one's being. Incredible movie. A must-see.,1
223, Well done almost living up to its grand ambitions for most of the duration minus the end. There is an obvious build up to the final climax which to say the least is laughable. Original ideas and well written intentionally pretentious script make V worth seeing.,1
224, It's not everyday we are reminded of just how fragile our freedoms are. Well written with compelling characters and just enough action to keep everyone happy.,1
225, Best movie I have ever seen. EVER!,1
226," Excellent film. Inspiring ideas, excellent actors, and a nice british touch. If you think a bit about things, you realise, the we are already heading fullspeed to the future depicted in V for Vendetta. This one is up there with Fahrenheit 451 and Orwell's 1984. An important piece of film, with a strong connection to todays political situation. Big brother is watching you!",1
227,"Excellent, makes you think.",1
228," A combination of Zorro and the Phantom of the Opera, mixed in with a weighty theme of the need for revolution when confronted with a totalitarian state. Very entertaining. Too bad it is released in march, because it is an Oscar-caliber film.",1
229,"V for vendetta is now in my top 5 movies of all time. i cried at the end, inspired by the thought that perhaps one day the people will no longer be afraid of their government.",1
230," All the hype that surrounded this movie was not in vain. I've been waiting since Batman Begins for another good blockbuster and this is definitely it. Those of you (critics included) that gave it bad scores, what are you THINKING? What do you want? V for Vendetta is ENTERTAINING, and ironically, not everyone wants to sit through an ""astonishing film masterpiece"" even if it's grueling. V for Vendetta is entertaining. Very, damn, entertaining.",1
231," Tight, entertening film, it had some real cool action and kept u on the edge of ur seat. What i really liked about it is that it wasn't just action, but it had a message, and that kinda scares me.",1
232, Brilliant. One of the smartest and most compelling movies ever made.,1
233," I feel sad for those that enjoy rating movies with lowly scores to help emphasis their superiority over any with an opposite view. Making you think is not necessarily boring to many, and there's something to be said about development and technical craft in a movie. Yes, I liked it, but, more importantly, the chaotic nature of the various revelations fit quite nicely with the anarchic theme; and kept me thinking long after the movie's end of the movie's possible intentions (or was that the point?).",1
234, Finally! A movie worth paying to see. Going in I only have a vague idea of what the story was about and was quickly pulled into the depth of the characters. This is a movie that goes beyond shallow action flicks and makes you think about the world around you. Too many people will get stuck on political prejudices and forget this is a movie about freedom and the price sometimes one must pay to keep it.,1
235, An amazing film. Too many parallels to our current political situation to be ignored.,1
236," Def a movie that has to be seen in the theater. Nice special effects, I would expect nothing less from the Bros. I wish that they spent more time on character development. The comics were much more into the back stories of each character, but I guess that's all you can do in the timeframe that they had.",1
237," An excellent movie. I enjoyed the word play of the main character V and Portman finally acted to her ability. I thought the pace was good and the intrigue allowed the movie to progress well. The movie could have been more suspensefull especially the ending but it was still satisfying in my opinion. I'm certain people will complain about being hit over the head with the parallels to our current government and its policies, but the people who voted for George W. are dense enough that you probably need a sledgehammer to help them connect the dots. If you gave this movie a low score, I hope you've scored most of the movies over the past 12 months with negatives...",1
238," Sorry but everyone is to busy getting cought up in the political relevence of this movie in comparison to whats going on in our world now. The movie to me seemed more relevent to hitler than anything but it borrows from all aspects of history and government(get over it). Who give a crap. The movie was made to entertain and thats exactly what the movie does. For those who complain about the dialoge in the movie, Im sorry but that was one of the best part for me. It was highly intelligent and very well thought out. 100 for me. LOVED this movie.",1
239," Having heard what a stinker this movie supposedly was, I went in expecting something along the lines of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. As I watched I kept thinking, ""so far so good,"" while nervously anticipating the suckiosity to kick in at any moment. When the film ended, I was a little stunned that I found myself liking it so much. I'm a big time Alan Moore fan, and first read ""V for Vendetta"" way back in the 80's. It seemed impossible that a film version could be made that wasn't dummed-down or changed entirely for the original work, as LOEG and From Hell had been. I am so happy that delighted that a quality film has come out of one of Moore's major works. Perhaps there's a chance that Watchmen will be made, and will be well-made. Having gone back and reread the criticisms that lead me to believe V for Vendetta would be a disappointment for me, I find that nothing anybody criticized about the film resonates with me at all. I usually can sees what it is critics who respond one way or another are reacting to, but in this case I was stumped. It makes me wonder if the material itself made some viewers so uncomfortable--since it can arguably be interpreted as ""pro terrorist""--that they needed to make up reasons not to like it, while at the same time not wanting say they didn't like it because of the controversial political dimension. This would be a very lame reason not to like a film, especially if you're a young hip movie critic with your young hip movie critic credibility on the line. You can't not like a movie just because it's anti-establishment, right? It seems we've been conditioned like Pavlov's dog to have a instinctual gut reactions whenever the bell of ""terror"" is rung. We don't want to think about why people blow things up in the first place, and the very idea of a radical civil action being anything but ""evil"" runs contrary to our programming. Strange, in a country that was born of radical civil action, that we would be so afraid to call a good movie ""good"", just for addressing some issues we don't want to think about. The robust box office gives me hope, though, that the masses are, once again, way out in front of the media.",1
240, This film was fantastic because it delivers more than just flashy entertainment. It involves the viewer and makes them imagine and contemplate. What this film showed was daring because it talked about how the government make up story's to scare the people so that the government can have a stronger hold over our lives. The power of fear is a powerful weapon that is used against us by our governments today! To be free of fear is to live. Dont let our governments scare you with its fabricated lies.,1
242," I just could not stop watching it was a beautifull film witch so many second meaning (else then politcs, love and vengence) Seriusly a great MUST SEE!",1
243," I hesitated to see this one, luckily some friends convinced me. The movie was a most excellent intermingling of Orwell's 1984, comic book heroism, and chivalry that I've ever seen. It was... The most loquacious litany of literary liturgy I've ever loved without any lassitude. The true romantic liberal could die peaceably after seeing this most wondrous movie...",1
244," I had only medium expectations for V For Vendetta, but imagine my suprise when I loved just about every nasty second of it. Brutal, intelligent, awesomely styled, and often surprisingly hilarious, the movie is a blast if you're in the mood to be challenged. This is what Sin City should have been like. Those expecting The Matrix IV will be disappointed - and as well they should be. As V, Hugo Weaving pulls of an amazing feat, giving a completely convincing performance with only his voice and body language to work with. Only an occasionally uneven Natalie Portman performance and slow spots in the middle keep this from a perfect score. Marvelous, coal-black fun!",1
247," Is it perfect? No. Is it compelling, dynamic storytelling (even when it lapsed into bombast or too much talk)? Yes. The few passages that didn't keep me riveted were more interesting than most of the product currently coming out of Hollywood (IMHO). Great work by Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Steven Rea.",1
248,"A visual treat, and the supporting cast is great.  I liked Portman as the heroine, but Weaving always behind the mask got tedious.  As for the our-culture-is-a-gulag politics, it's a leftist agi-prop fantasy.   But I believe that movie writers hate GWB that much... Lord knows there's plenty of supporting evidence all around us.",1
249," This was an outstanding movie. It's been 20 years (or seems that way) since I read the graphic novel, so I'd forgotten the details of the story. Powerful stuff.",1
250," With so much happening around the world today, the timing is perfect for this movie to raise such questions as to appear risky and controversial. Combine that with powerful performance by the cast and great presentation, the result is a charming, thoughtful movie, just enough to provoke the general audience as well as entertain.",1
251," Just so we are clear, this film neither glorifies terorism nor does it say democracy is bad. It simply asks sensible questions; like what powers should governments have? and what is the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter? Questions in the current global environment anyone worth their salt should be aking themselves. Anyway, how can a film whos tagline is 'people should not be affraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of thier people' be anti-democracy etc, etc? However even though this film challenges its audience to ask itself questions, and even though Hugo Weaving was exceptional, it wasn't the most entertaining film i've seen and its not as though other sources haven't challenged us to ask these questions before, hence the 7.",1
252," This was a terriffic film. It makes you think, but it's not boring, and the British actors lend some heft to anything they are involved in. The critics giving this bad score or saying it was incoherent (ahem, wall street journal) are most likely republicans or american apologists. Hopefully a lot of people (especially younger folks) will see this and pay attention to what it says.",1
253, It is rare that you find a movie like this that blends mind-bending action and fight scenes with such tremendous depth and such an interesting and powerful story. How the critics gave this movie less than ninety baffles me.,1
254," This is one of the most political, thought-provoking, well-thought movies that I have seen. If you are looking to be spoon-fed an trite action-movie, then this may not be for you. But, if you want to be overwhelmed by political comments, symbolism and thought-provoking notiions, then this is the movie of a life-time. I think that this will be a cult classic for many many years! I now know how my family, friends and I will be dressing for halloween this year!",1
255," Simply amazing. The greatest piece of film I've ever seen. The action sequences are some of the best you'll see in a movie like this, and the story is incredible. How can someone give this any less than a 9/10. It was just amazing.",1
256," After hearing Alan Moore's (the writer of the graphic novel) complaints, I came into this movie expecting a typical, watered-down Hollywood flick. Although there were some changes from the original source material, ""V for Vendetta"" was still a great, though-provoking film that didn't pull any punches. Whether you agree with the politics or not (which should by no means determine your opinion of the movie), you can't deny that the directors told an exciting and intelligent story. All this would have been for nothing if not for the great acting. Nataly Portman proved once again that ""Star Wars"" doesn't represent her acting abilities, and deserves a lot of credit for making a fully masked character seem human. The only flaws were in the over-simplifying of certain characters and situations. For example, the ""evil"" portrayal of the government was taken to the extreme, making it less believable that they could have gained the love of so many people. In the graphic novel, the high chancellor was a multi-dimensional character who was made sympathetic by his isolation and inability to relate to humans. The film should have followed that example, instead of making him your typical raving lunatic. Additionally, the whole scene at the end with everyone in a Guy Fawkes mask was a little too over the top. It was like the directors didn't trust the viewers to understand the spreading of V's ideal if they weren't bludgeoned over the head with it. However, despite those flaws ""V for Vendetta"" was still a great movie that goes above and beyond typical Hollywood films. Put aside your politics and preconceived notions and judge it on its own merits. You may not agree with the political message, but there is no denying that ""V for Vendetta"" is both thought provoking, and exceptionally well crafted.",1
257," Excellent adaptation of the comic book. This movie proves that Hollywood can be still fed from marvel / dc / vertigo even after milestones like Batman Begins and Sin City. Great job also from the acting perspective. Will go to seethe again this coming weekend .. it deserves it ! Peace .. ehm ,, I mean ... V !!",1
258," It was a good movie, all in all. Could have used a little bit more action at times, and sometimes the plot got a little bit messy, but it was still enjoyable. I would probably give it an 8.5 to be specific, but im feeling generous and rounding up.",1
259, Excellent movie! My best movie experience in a long while. It really makes you think and make you realize that many things presented in this movie are already happening reflected in the claims of some critics that the producers of this movie are siding with the terrorists...,1
260," didnt have ""the edge"" it needed, with no edge it was just compounded psychobable with excellent performances by both leads, never seen natalie more dramatic.",1
261, I really liked V for Vendetta. It is probably the best film playing in theatres right now. I recommend everybody to go see it.,1
262," Very entertaining, great story and great acting.",1
263, I have never posted a movie review before but this film was so inspiring and relevant that I I must register my vote. The hero represents an ideal whose spirit we can only hope to adopt.,1
264, Lets keep it real folks. The movie / comic book is obviously and homage to 1984. Considering when the original comic came out and how near the world was to becoming 1984 it was very timely. 20 years in the future and we are facing the same problems. If your looking for mindless entertainment I suggest standing in line waiting to get on a plane. If you would like a movie with a point V is perfect.,1
265," A truly fantastic thriller/sci-fi, that was not only captivating, but featured mesmerizing performances by Weaving and Portman and was thought-provoking as well.",1
266," This movie did have it's share of flaws, most do, but I enjoyed it more than just about anything that I've seen in the last year. It is super relevant, in my opinion, to what is going on in the U.S. right now.",1
267," This has to be my favorite movie of all time! It has a great twist to it, if you liked the first Matrix, then you will love this movie!",1
268, V for Vendetta is one of the greatest comics book hero movies of all time and the greatest movie of the 21st Century.,1
269," V for Vendetta is not a perfect movie, but considering the fact that it is very exciting and still manages to deliver a meaningful, relevant message is commendable. It is a shame that because of the political climate in the country it is being overlooked for serious recognition.",1
270," A Very fine, well planned, and Virtuous film. The foreshadowing was utterly brilliant and Hugo WeaVing and Natalie Portman made this moVie one of the greatest I'Ve eVer seen!! It has a perfect mix of action, drama, mystery, twists, and turns. An astounding moVie! Remember, remember, the fifth of NoVember!",1
271," And ideas, Mr. Creedy, are petty-rants, complex verbous babbling criticts -proof.",1
272," Complex, yet down to earth, this movie combines great vocabulary with great ideas and some awesome actions scenes, even though the Washington post says it's hard to connect with a masked figure, we all know what he was for and really how he felt on the topic. I found this to be my all time favorite movie and I have watched TONS of movies.",1
273," This film is the best that I have ever laid my eyes on. I have seen it over 16 times and i could still see it more. It includes violence, blood shed, action, romance and yet retains it British touch of class. V the main character choses to use words over weapons and uses weapons only to insure his words get through to his audience. But brilliantly this movie differs to the stereotypical category that super hero films seem unable to claw it way out of. But the first time I watched this movie I thought, why the hell didn't I get to see his face. But this movie dose not show its main characters face. It leaves an opening for the audience to create there idea of ""V"" and his physical appearance. Every time I watch this movie I love it even more. The fact that you fo not even see the main characters face is a testament to it differentialness from any other hero film. This movie also manages to turn an evil terrorist ""V"" and tells his story so poetically that you feel how he feels, you see what I see"" and yes that was a line from the film. Also the use of words in this movie is perfect. The way that every single speech has been carved into a perfect statue that represents his anger and disobedience against this extreme right wing political party. Those are the reasons for why I love V for Vendetta so much, that I would be willing to defend it to the hill and keep my conscious clean.",1
274," Very good indeed. It's not often that films that are not explicity marketed as ""think pieces"" generate some serious thought. For the attentive viewer, there's enough heavyweight material in here to dwell on for days. I feel that Brits will particularly enjoy this film, but it also appeals to (dare I say) a mass audience. As V comments, ideas are hard to kill, and my mind was seething with them following my viewing. Add to that, it was a thrilling ride to boot. This is a film made by a professional. V is particulary captivating, and has a keen sense of timing for an apt literary quote. Add to that the attention to detail and subtle presentation. There's some very subtle splicing of modern day issues (and newsreel) into the film, presented as ""history"". Very good indeed.",1
275,"A satisfying watch. An original plot, John Hurt is excellent, as ever. Not just a good popcorn action /  thriller movie, although it is that too, an effective satire on the current political apathy and paranoia of British Politics today. An outlandish cautionary tale, but cautionary tales are important still.",1
276,"A statement of political nature and warning against all of mankind: resist the urge to turn over the power that you'll always have. When the system fails, rebel against the system. When men and women seek to take control over the world, take them down. V for Vendetta is an inspiring and powerful gut punch of ideology in an increasingly-relevant setting since its 2006 debut. Coming up on its 10 year anniversary, this Wachowski Bros (The Matrix trilogy) product serves as both great entertainment and crucial reminder that governments serve the people and not vice versa. Especially in an age where there's increasingly instability among governments and people, with the recent rise in terrorism, V for Vendetta rings true as ever. If you're coming for the action, hopefully you'll stay for the history lesson. I love this movie more today than I did 10 years ago. That's probably because I understand its premise and its intentions much more than when I was in college. A must-see if you're in to a film that can exercise your brain and your emotions. Also, Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving (The Matrix, Lord of the Rings) turn in excellent performances that help carry the movie when things haven't yet begun to unravel.",1
277,"An enjoyable movie for those who want a bit of philosophy with their action. Weaving and Portman are phenominal, while the cinematography and mood are great. Though it is good, don't compare it to the graphic novel by Alan Moore(as many changes were made), nor look too deeply at the philosophy on hand. It is a middle ground film in ways, but I enjoyed the mix.",1
278,"I gave it an 8 only because it was much too violent in the end.  I saw both the TV version, still somewhat violent, and cable not realizing it was the R version until well into the end.  I thought it was a great film as it was not just original, directed and acted well, but I found it to be artsy.   Usually Americans cannot execute or enjoy the artsy films like the Europeans can.  It has a message about people vs. governments but in a way that is not offensive.",1
279,"Likable movie. The story was unique and at some points touching. I loved the twists and the games V planned for everyone. It was like he was the master of puppets :) And also, actors did their job very well.",1
280,"Personally I reckon this is a must see film for anyone, the messages are deep the music choices are great, acting excellent and and even the films weakest points leaves many hollywood blockbusters in the dust.The film is a fantastic remake of the comic and has great re-watchability.To be honest I would like to **** slap anybody who rated this a 5 or less, I can understand political and idealogical differences but most of the reasons I have read are either downright stupid, written by people who obviously never watched the film or by people that completely missed it's the point and message. If you have more than two brain cells to rub together this is a great film., if not might I direct you to transformers and twilight. instead",1
281,"Definitely in my top 10 films. Excellent all around with rich characters and a story you will love watching to its final conclusion. V himself is the best character by far, not bad for a character that is limited to using his voice and body language only as his face is obscured by a mask!",1
283,"I don't know if it was the cultural impact or the mixed religious outcries that people thought the film was portraying, but either way, V for Vendetta is definitely one of the most controversial, loved, hated but respected films in the last decade.Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, a man who disowned and does not acknowledge this film, the film is set in the not too distant future, when Britain is under a very fascist regime under the authority of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt). The rest of the world is in turmoil with countless civil wars, yet the UK holds strong due to its dictatorship, there are curfews and sensors in place, Big Brother has its very own playground indeed.But there are of course those that are driven too far, and when Evey hammond (Natalie Portman) is rescued by a masked man simply known by the letter 'V' (Hugo Weaving), she begins to question everything she has ever known, while the Guy Fawkes fanatic V sets in motion a plan for Britain to free itself from the shackles of its worst enemy...itself.V has a past that is told throughout the film, and while we don't see his face, there is plenty of pain behind the mask, a wrong which he is hoping to right.As mentioned, the film is very central to the plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament by Guy Fawkes centuries before, something which he failed to do. V attempts to use this as a key to freeing the people of their repression, by giving them the power.Of course a film like this isn't without its controversies, which I do believe clouded a lot of the judgement of the film itself, its a dramatic, action and thriller oriented flick that will please those looking for a good struggle against politics, and this is perhaps why many hated it, there are plenty of coded messages within the film that do pick at events that have already occurred in a own very real world, but this isn't a political article, its a film review, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film, apart from the lighting was a tad out of touch and at times completely frustrating, but not a movie killerNatalie Portman gives a sound and emotional performance as Evey Hammond, but being over-shadowed by a man whose face we don't even see, but his voice literally does tell the story, Hugo Weaving. He commands the screen with his opening speech with enough v words to make you dizzy, but he also portrays a man on a mission. Stephen Rea gives an excellent performance as the torn detective Finch, who is never quite sure to admit what he believes to be true.It certainly gives all the signals of a political thriller, but for its fantastic final act, intriguing story and character development, V for Vendetta is a solid and enjoyable effort from the Wachowski brothers.",1
284,V for Vendetta is a great film! Its light on action but heavy on delivering a message that's(while subjective to some but clear to others) thought provokingly deep and has excellent characters that you'll love(or hate). Hugo weaving..Natalie portman...John hurt...and Stephen rea are impressive throughout the movie!! Hugo weaving was just as smart as he was a dangerous killing machine while on his quest for vengeance while free Britain from a fascist government! Stephen rea almost steals the spotlight with an exceptional performance as Fitch! John hurts portrayal of chancellor Adam sadler was completely believable. Like most oppressive leaders...he's completely single-minded(and not in a good way) kills for what he believes is right regardless if its right or not and makes things disappear(including people) he finds offensives in any way!! Now evey(played by Ms.portman) was great as she finds herself inadvertently caught up in V's plan for vengeance/justice(well until she maces a police detective) Her backstory is both dramatic and tragic as V's which is why they work well with each other..both characters complimenting each others strengths while adding something to each other(V gives evey her the strength to live without fear while evey gives V  reason to feel something other than hate..love!) Now the overall point/tone/nature of this film(while subjective to the viewers) is religion and an oppressive government meets a terrorist out for revenge AND justice so he can bring down a fascist government...confused? You should be because this is a movie remember...Now I wont say that V for Vendetta doesn't take political jabs at how government systems over step their boundaries(albeit extreme in this movie) but it raises the question of are we as a society being manipulated and controlled through fear(Tv) war and other tragedies that we as a society turn to a would be savior at the cost of our freedom? Should people be thrown in nazi-like camps...be tortured and experimented on like lab rats because their gay or lesbian...or speak out against their government? The religious and political undertones are quite strong but once again...this is just a movie. So I say this....if you are strongly religious or sensitive when it comes to religion or politics then steer clear of this movie because you will be offended!! And that's my point...I'm religious but do I think gays and lesbians should be punished or that they are disgusting? No..if that's who you are then so be it!  Do I support terrorism? No!! But I will say this about V...was he really a terrioist? I don't think so...If anyone says he was then clearly you missed the point of his character to the point where Fitch(Stephen rea) says he isn't one and has a OVERWHELMING NEED to know who V was and why he was doing what he was doing because he eventually see's the connection with Saint Mary's tragedy...three waters incident and the party members V was killing and questions his government involvement in the deaths of all those people. Although nothing  this extreme would happen(I hope not) in real life...V for Vendetta does hit home on a persons personal feelings and problems with a system of government..how it affects not just them but society as a whole...social conformity through the media and tapped phones....social ignorance(we follow but do not. question)strict religious beliefs...control through fear and panic etc..etc..The worst thing about this movie is its light on action so if your an action junkie..pass on this. Evey wasn't needed anymore after she survived V's torture as she's seen in several scenes just walking around until shes given a reason to be apart of the movie again at the end.  This movie is a bit controversial in its approach to religion...fascism...social conformity...terrorism...sexual preference and acceptance of a persons preferred sexual choice and the complete domination of an entire country through surveillance...kidnapping..torture..scientific research and wanton murderer of thousands of people may cause an uproar(either good or bad) is only natural...so I will say this again....do not watch this movie if you are sensitive in your religious or political(both?) beliefs gay or lesbian or loves the Koran...you've been warned!! Great movie the wachowski brothers(I loved all three matrix movies) 9 out of 10!!,1
285,"People like ""KristinaS"" down there make me want to blow my brains out.  The movie is about the idea of true freedom.  About questioning things and not just taking information that the government/news feed you (which you clearly don't do).  This movie is one of my favourites and I don't know why it has such a low critic score.  Probably because the critics are people like KristinaS down there...",1
286,"There are quite a lot of conflicting reviews on this film. I didn't read the graphic novel yet so I don't have the burden of seeing how they compared, all I know is that I enjoy this movie immensely every single time it is on. I can look at this movie as its own entity and I absolutely love it.",1
287,"I really liked the movie. The plot was very interesting. The acting was good for the most part (I wasnt satisfied by some of the supporting cast). What hurt this movie was the poor action sequences, pathetic death scenes (such as in the final fight of the film), and the painfully obvious fake blood. It was a little disapointing imo. However, Its still a very solid movie that is well worth the watch.",1
288,I didn't watch this movie for the political struggle and I didn't watch it 3 times after that because of the fantastically charming protagonist. I watched this because it poses ACTUAL moral dilemma's. What makes war just? Is violence an acceptable means of justice? Questions like these provoke thought and may even define the movie itself.,1
289,Cinema at its finest. V for Vendetta is a prime example of thrilling an audience and entertaining them amidst a dystopia. Natalie Portman is magnificent--but did we really expect any less from her? Nope!,1
290,"V per Vendetta Ã¨ l'esempio perfetto di come fare un film tratto da un fumetto senza renderlo una mera commercialata o un'action tutta azione zero trama, zero spessore... Sono riusciti a trasmettere il messaggio che il fumetto voleva trasmetttere senza stravolgerne nessun angolo. E' un connubio perfetto tra fumetto e film. E senza considerare il fattto che Ã¨ tratto dal una graphic novel rimane comunque un film di tutto rispetto codibile da tutto il pubblico senza limitazioni agli appasionati di Moore.",1
291,"amazing movie, love it !!!!and V and Evey are so awesome together, they bring out the best in each other, he makes her strong and she makes him a better person",1
292,"I was not expecting this one to be a great film, but boy oh boy was it ever a great film. First off, Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman are beyond phenomenal in the film, in particular Weaving. He is a true revelation. However, the true stars here are the Wachowski Brothers. Honestly, the script for this film may be one of the best I have ever seen. So many powerful, heartbreaking, moving, inspirational, important, and quotable, lines in this one. There are two scenes in particular that are so well written that man do they hit you. They just knocked me on my ass and left me trying to recover from what I had just seen. On top of this, the cinematography here is gorgeous, as is the production value. This is eye candy in its truest form (again, one scene in particular comes to mind with dominos, like, mmm baby). On top of that, the action sequences are brilliantly shot and choreographed and the special effects utilized there and in other scenes are picture perfect. My only complaint would be the CGI blood effects. They were unnecessary and over the top. However, on than that, this film is marvelous.",1
293,"Based on the comic series by Vertigo (DC Comics Label) a movie with a gripping storyline, intense moments and a stupefying script is created by the Wachowski Brothers, foretelling a possible prophecy for future generations about totalitarian  super-countries like America and Britain. Amazing twists and unsolved mysteries, coupled with the cunning and menacing freedom fighter V (Hugo Weaving) juxtaposed to the beautiful and extraordinary Eve (Natalie Portman) creates a movie that can be watched many times without getting old.",1
294,Great atmosphere of dystopia and dictatorship. Nice graphic novel-based story. I can call this movie uhh...inspirational. It convinces that everyone should fight for his rights and freedom.,1
295,"With a story that's as politically potent as it is brilliantly structured, ""V For Vendetta""   makes for an uncommonly enthralling action-thriller with a very salient point.",1
296,"A deeply moving film. Good acting all around. Natalie Portman nails it every time. V is a very intriguing character. Though it was not so thought provoking it was highly entertaining. I'm glad to have seen it. Very well made. In a time where we have seen rebellions rise from literally nothing of consequence, the plot was not so implausible.",1
297,"Absolutely fantastic film! A modern classic in my opinion, with important, timeless themes. Natalie Portman is fantastic. Hugo Weaving owns; I love that we never get to see V's face.",1
298,"I absolutely loved it. Real world political innuendos aside, it is rather clever and does make you think. I'm sure mindless action fans must have hated it as the point will clearly go over their heads. It's no where near as good as the comic, but to be fair, for a movie adaptation it did the best it could within the time frame allotted to it. Overall: great movie that can be a little too pretentious at times. But I was highly entertained none the less.",1
299,"This film turned out to be nothing like I thought it would, and that's a good thing. The performances were interesting, convincing, and my whole rating could easily be just for Hugo Weaving's amazing ""V"" monologue.",1
300,"I loved this movie! Perfect example of what a movie should be. The story line was unpredictable, in a good way, and  anyone who says it is not and that it is too unrealistic should consider watching this film again and actually pay attention.",1
301,"MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME! Hugo Weaving is perfect as V, Natalie Portman is perfect as Evie Hammond and John Hurt is perfect as Adam Sutler. I am a very picky movie reviewer but this is a flawless movie!",1
302,"Daring, vibrant, intelligent, full of innovative little twists and with the right actress to pull it off. The whole 2 hour-long run time flies as the film keeps it interesting and with the right pace. Underrated film (cannot believe this barely surpassed a 60 out of 100 when it comes to the critics average score) that probably suffered from the London terrorist attacks that same year. Time to re-watch or discover this little treasure. See it!",1
303,"amazing, explosive, nuts and passionate. v for vendetta is a master work, that will make you mind explore. definitely not your eyes unglued from the screen",1
304,"Esta pelicula nos da una nueva perspectiva de libertad y de que un hombre con convicion y coraje es capaz de hacer mucho por un pueblo oprimido, demacrado y despojado de sus derechos.",1
305,I remember when my sister bought Guy Fawks's mask for my birthday! This movie is just great! A wonderful and emotional action  MUST WATCH! My score is 7/10,1
306,"Really enjoyed this film! The story and the visual style of this film was remarkable and kept me very engaged in the world as well as the characters! Even though there was not as much action as I had expected throughout, it pays of with a series of very cool event that lead up to an immensely satisfying conclusion! Has me very interested to read the graphic novel!",1
307,"This is by far one of DC comics most interesting movies as it tells a story both heart retching and loveable.V is the most interesting character I have ever seen and you never see his face.This is by far a brilliant movie to watch and is worth the 2 hours you give up to watch it.",1
308,"Since V for Vendetta is my favorite movie of all time, I have to give it a 10 out of 10! I absolutely love the premise of the movie, as well as the script, plot, characters and dialogue. First of all, Hugo Weaving totally owns the role of V, he's sophisticated, intelligent and BAD ASS! V is such a lovable character with billions of lines that send a message about humanity. Then there's Natalie Portman as Evey Hammond, she was great to, she was believable and had that realism to her, she didn't over act or anything, she actually seemed like a normal woman who is taken under V's wing. The movie really sends a message about humanity, and this is what I think of it, when the public is out of control, they will do anything to re-establish a state of order, even if it means giving up rights, humanity will give in to anything. The movie also sends a message about human cruelty, the unfairness of life, and the consequences of genocide. Its an amazing movie with great characters, dialogue and plot. It will put your mind to the test, so if you want a hardcore action movie, you may not like V for Vendetta because its not action, its a political movie! So go watch this flawless masterpiece!",1
309,"""V for Vendetta"" is a cinematic thrill ride that delivers both entertainment and thought provoking messages to those in the audience. Hugo Weaving's performance is phenomenal as is Natalie Portman's. The two main characters are surrounded with a cast of supporting characters that deliver performances that are worth remembering.""V for Vendetta"" is cinema at it's best. The movie is a beautifully delivered roller coaster ride consisting of some of the most eye popping action sequences, flawless acting, wonderful cinematography and extremely relevant messages about what mankind does when it is given power. All of these things add to why ""V for Vendetta"" is my favorite film. A try masterpiece delivered to us with both style and substance.",1
311,"Not to be mistaken for a serious jab at political scrutiny, it is still an undeniably exhilarating vigilante thriller with enough wit and provocative dialogue to suffice.",1
312,"V for Vendetta feels like a vendetta against the government but one can not help admire its deeply thought characters, great visuals and good storyline & premise.",1
314,"One of the best films I've seen. The suspense of this work is perfectly orchestrated, as are some of the character designs (namely V and the aristocrats). The film is fun, exciting, action-packed, and witty. If you don't like it, something's probably wrong with you.",1
315,"Director James McTeigue's action set pieces have satisfying crime fighting scenes it's not mindblowing or ""look at that! That was cool "" moments , however the Wachowski brothers screenplay engages mystery and suspense the story is intrigued, interesting in the British thesps and it's effective political message. So it's like world war three but in London, so London is a police state controlled by a authoritarian government, a vigilante know as V (Hugo Weaving) using terrorist tactics to fight the oppressors of the world which he's living on. V saves a woman Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from the secret police he discovers an ally in his fight against England's oppressors and has a relationship with Evey. It's sounds like Weaving is trying to an impression of batman for some odd reason, he is once again fantastic in a Wachowski brothers movie but once you get to know his character it's impressive we can feel for his character. Portman was exceptional as V's sidekick/girlfriend. Okay look this movie has a effective political message but it there's nothing about the action that is all that great. But some people might take the film offensive.  Grade A",1
316,"The movie is slow but,the at ors are really good and the action scenes are well made.The atmosphere is scary and V is one of the best ""villain"".The end is really good even if the movie was predictable.",1
317,"Its narrative is quite contrived and melodramatic - but in this case, it really doesn't matter. Its powerful message is hammered home with great intensity, supported by an excellent cast and great visuals. V for Vendetta will be a fantastic thrill-ride for some, and a strongly-worded cautionary tale for others.",1
318,"This is perhaps the most compelling heroic narrative still in circulation. It details both an internal personal heroic journey as well as one that is external and societal. It taps into a coherent and relevant understanding of human psychology that delivers a potent story. Do you live a life of fear, on in which your truest self is repressed by those around you? This story offers an analog in which through embracing our own mortality we become free to choose are own destiny.",1
320,"Wow I mean such cool dagger fights! and this movie is just like... so fu*king deep... like the f**king ocean and s**t. Plus like, it talks about the government watching us an stuff... spooky! that could totally be happening for real we need to start a revolution!",1
321,"Why 10? Every scene is simply a memorable scene. This move represents a milestone on the ""rouge governments"" films niche. The literary devices (such as alliteration) are used to build suspense and that results in great speeches. Secondary, the plot and the acting are pretty nice and fit well the suspense build-up. Also, the idea of a personal revenge that ultimately serves the revolutionary spirit - it's just great. It gives the movie a very intimate feeling. Saving the world serves not only the common good, but the hero's vendetta. Probably the take-away is ""Because beneath this mask there's an idea, [...] and ideas are bulletproof"". To me, that's one of the most memorable movie lines. Simply loved it!",1
322,"By all rights, this should be the worst time imaginable to release V For Vendetta, a film with—there's really no polite word for it—a terrorist hero prone to saying things like ""Violence can be used for good,"" and ""Sometimes blowing up a building can change the world."" So why does V For Vendetta play as such a crowd-pleaser? The answer is simple and unsettling. Set in a totalitarian future-Britain that pairs the dystopian state of George Orwell's 1984 with the brutality of Nazi Germany, it makes heroes out of the treasonous by calling up our repulsion for historical fascist atrocities, but also by relying on us to recognize how fascism can inch into everyday life in the name of security. It's a preemptive strike for resistance, and a reminder that freedom demands protection. Hugo Weaving plays liberty's self-appointed guardian, a man in a Guy Fawkes mask who calls himself ""V"" and lives in a bunker filled with forbidden art, from Hans Holbein to Cat Power. Taking his mission public, he blows up the Old Bailey shortly after rescuing Natalie Portman—an office drone working for Britain's single TV network—from a gang of sexually aggressive policemen. Later, he brings her underground, making her a reluctant (at least initially) accomplice in a plot to topple the government. Written and produced by Larry and Andy Wachowski of Matrix fame, and directed by Matrix second-unit director James McTeigue, the film reworks an '80s graphic novel illustrated by David Lloyd and written by Alan Moore (uncredited here, by his own choice) as a howl of rage against where Moore felt the Thatcher administration was headed. It is, in its essence, a remarkably faithful adaptation that should have perhaps stayed even more faithful. Only when the script and visuals stray too far from the source does the film lose its way, getting bogged down in the mechanics of big-budget action filmmaking and ponderous dialogue as it works toward a way-too-tidy, sentimental finale. The mask doesn't always help either, making it hard for Portman and Weaving to build the relationship the story requires. Weaving stepped into the role when James Purefoy stepped out (though some of Purefoy's scenes remain), and many shots suggest what undid him: It's hard to convey emotion behind a perpetual smile. And emotion does enter into it: One long monologue (taken almost directly from Moore) that's worked into a vicious sequence depicting Portman's personal awakening is simultaneously uplifting and harrowing, a call for freedom even in the face of grave consequences. V For Vendetta tries, but it never quite achieves the same tone elsewhere. Mostly, it's content to remain a compelling, visually striking political mystery with some big ideas woven into it—subversive notions about integrity, liberty, and political change. And though it stutters in getting it out, the film clearly means what it says. As weapons against oppression go, passion and sincerity can sometimes do more damage than a bomb.",1
323,"amazing film with a very important message for the people, is open our eyes and see what's in the media and government, very good movie and recommended to all.",1
324,"Natalie Portman plays feisty young lady under a fascist regime led by John Hurt. If you have any sympathy with radicals or revolutionaries, you'll probably enjoy this dystopian tale though there are some almost-camp moments. It won't appeal to conservatives or the conventional.",1
325,"""Remember, remember the fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and plot. I know of no reason why the gun powder treason should ever be forgot."" Yep! Imagine a movie where Hugo Weaving recites a declamation speech for almost two hours.When the state of London becomes under the leadership of a fascist government, one vigilante code named as V (Weaving) uses his terrorist scheme to under power and end the tyranny in which he now lives. Until he soon meets Evey (Portman) and discovers a loyalty to him.This film serves as a representation of both freedom and terrorism with great acting and characterizations for the main stars. The two lead actors have a dark and disturbing chemistry which shines in either of the mysterious and romantic sides of the story. But besides Weaving and Portman, the rest of the characters are nowhere near as investing.The script is written by the Wachowski brothers which is magnificent. It blends the messages of politics into one exhilarating style of workable screenplay. Their writing technique is deeply moving yet rich in heavy dialogue, however just like what as mentioned, some of the characters are dull and not interesting.VERDICT: A portrait of politics and revolution in a thrilling way with free declamation speeches.",1
326,"Remember Remember, the 5th of November. A great tale of vigilantism in society. It was nicely crafted by everyone in the film and well made. The movie is a classic.",1
327,Essential. Vertigo label never disappoints. Everyone should see this film at least once in the life.,1
328,"This is an outstandingly amazing film. The lead characters, Hugo Weaving's V and Natalie Portman's Evey Hammond, were portrayed amazingly. The film doesn't have some cheesy romance, instead it has a more professional relationship between the two. This film also takes enough time to flesh out it's characters. The final battle is awesome and was very climactic. My favorite part of the film is it's themes about standing up for whats right no matter what. In the end, this is an amazing film with barely anything wrong with it.",1
329,"This is just a great film in almost every aspect of filmmaking. The script, superb. The story, impeccable. If Natalie Portman is going to shave her head for the movie you know it is going to be good, and trust me, it is. The character journey of V is magnificent. One of the best comic-book movies of all time. The Cinematography couldn’t be better, A+. In conclusion, the finished product is outstanding. 10 out of 10.",1
330,"Following world war, London is a police state occupied by a fascist government, and a vigilante known only as V (Hugo Weaving) uses terrorist tactics to fight the oppressors of the world in which he now lives.

Visually stunning and thought-provoking, V For Vendetta's political pronouncements may rile some, but its story and impressive set pieces will nevertheless entertain. V for Vendetta gets an A-.",1
331,"This film focuses on the mysterious figure V, a masked without name or identity that stands against the English government. Everything takes place in a dystopian future, where parliamentary democracy gave way to a totalitarian one-party government, based on a strongly nationalist, repressive and ultra-conservative ideology. Inspired by a catholic conspiracy of the seventeenth century (the Gunpowder Plot), V declares himself a defender of democracy, starts a terror campaign against the government and incites the people to revolt against dictatorship. But, what no one knows is that V is driven by a desire of vengeance linked to his mysterious past. By his side is Evey Hammond, a young woman who is saved by V and eventually become close to him.The film is an adaptation of a comic book written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd in the eighties. It was directed by James McTeigue, who also directed the ""Matrix"" trilogy and that seems to have a particular taste for Orwellian dystopias. The cast is headed by Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portmann in the roles of V and Evey, having been at a great level and toasted the audience with excellent performances. Very interesting are also some dialogs and talks, in particular the way that V introduces himself before Evey in the beginning of the film, where almost every word he says begin with the letter V. The character was able to transcend their individuality and become a symbol of struggle, with a gentle touch of anarchism. Such a strong symbol that, even today, we see masks similar to those used in this film in many protests around the world.The only negative note: this film does, although perhaps without that intention, a ""defense"" that the ends justify the means, and no matter the destruction of public buildings, works of art and historical monuments when we are looking, through this gesture, to defend an idea or cause that we thought to be important. However, this is terrorism, and the people who does it are that fanatics that we used to condemn in other movies and in real life, which makes this idea too dangerous to be ""supported"" by films like this.",1

333,The BEST In super Hero Movies Batter then all the Marvel Movies And Super Heroes,1
334,"One of the most influential movies of the DC Universe till date. You always feel the freshness of the subject whenever you watch the movie. Some don't find the movie interesting, perhaps because they don't realize the danger envisioned in the movie. As V rightly says -   People are used to - ""The Security of the Familiar, tranquility of repetition...""",1
335,Excellent movie and highly thought provoking. The casting and production values are simply mind blowing.,1
336,"The movie is beautiful, I really like the graphics, and the special effects that are behind it, beautiful interpretation on character V",1
337,"Beautiful, just beautiful. Moving story, well played characters and just a gem to watch.",1
338,"I’m a huge fan of Alan Moore and although this is very well done, it loses the essence of what made the comic so good. I did have some have some issues with the last 20-30 mins (funnily, its what is most changed from the comic) but I loved it up to there.",1
339,"I find this movie rather ambiguous. On the one hand, almost all laws of the genre are observed in the film. On the other hand, the plot cannot be called straightforward, and the actions of the heroes make you think about how justified they are and cause associations with the real world. After this movie, I started using the Utopia p2p application. The pluses can also be attributed to high-quality and sometimes exciting shooting, the game of actors, some interesting details.",1
340,"This movie is really good, Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) and V (Hugo Weaving) have some amazing chemistry with each other throughout most scenes. Also, this movie has got an interesting plot with some really good camerawork during most of the fight scenes and some of the other main scenes throughout this movie. Finally, it's got some really powerful and hearted scenes throughout with some really good effects which do hold up quite well. The only effect which sort of bugged me was probably the blood effect, it was very mixed for me there would be moments where it looked really good and some where it looked like the Mortal Kombat 2 blood effect. Overall, it's a really good movie with some amazing actors, an interesting plot and some really good bloody fight scenes, worth the watch.",1
341,V for Vendetta is one of my favorite films of all time.  I believe it is the best DC Comics movie.,1
