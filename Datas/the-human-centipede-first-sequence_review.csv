0,"There are certain horror movies that are gross and that is their general appeal. Some horror movies attempt to be original and that is their general appeal. The Human Centipede's appeal? Well it attempts to try to mix these together, but the lack of substance already puts it below what you would normally expect. In addition though, the Human Centipede is a sick and disturbing movie that has no general appeal in its story, and absolutely no substance. The graphic content alone makes the movie nearly unwatchable, but the rest of the movie is just as painful. From laughable dialogue and situations, acting, and a bland mood that doesn't make the movie more exciting or scary. The Human Centipede: First Sequence is just a sick, horrendous movie that no one should watch. From a film and general perspective, this movie is abysmal.",0
1,"It's certainly not boring, and it was fun seeing exactly how the doctor would get the people into the configuration, but after that, it's pretty darned gross. When he urges the front guy to ""eat, eat"", so he can get the whole process going, I came about as close as I've ever come to dry heaving in a movie. So yeah, I'm glad I saw what all the fuss is about. But I can now see why Roger Ebert didn't want to give it a star rating.  It's really pointless to do so.  But I have seen worse!",0
2," My advice is: do not go and see this movie, it's not worth the 15 bucks. This is not a horror movie, it's just really sick.",0
3,"A creepy, disgusting concept that shouldn't have made it into production. The plot and acting are horrendous, and once you actually see what happens to the girls and the asian guy, there's no reason to keep watching.",0
4,"There are some things that should not be made into movies; splicing people ass-to-mouth is one such thing.  There is absolutely nothing interesting, thrilling, or remotely entertaining about this film.",0
5,"This movie is my **** nightmare! Do not watch this movie, spare yourselves from the mental scarring that this movie will inflict upon you. Ever since I have watched this movie I have not been able to get my full nights rest. The image of the human centipede was, and still is, stuck in my head. I seriously regret watching this movie. Please do yourselves a favour, and do not watch this movie. You will be thanking me for my advice for the rest of your lives. I wish I could invent a time machine to just erase the very thought of this movie from my head. I get the chills just thinking about the movie. Please, just don't watch this movie. I think I'm going to catch Hannah Montana from the Disney Channel. Have a nice day everyone.",0
6,"awfull disturbing horrible, the biggest crap i have ever seen in my whole life, the person that created this ""work of art"" must be sick, HAS to be sick...",0
7,"This film shouldn't be categorized as a horror, there's nothing scary about it at all. The film's plot is so full of holes, and that ""100% Medically Accurate"" tag is a joke. If you want to keep your sanity, skip this film.",0
9,"Ok, Legit WTF just happened. This movie consumed my soul and made me think deeper to the depths that humans will go to in order to get what they want. What they want I don't know. It appears to be torture porn because this movie was 2 hours of torture porn",1
10," Probably the best horror film of all time, in that you don't even need to see it to have nightmares. Just reading the plot description was enough to give me nightmares, and put me off food for several days.",0
11, Is this really what horror films have come to?,0
12,"Run for the hills. Not only does this film cross foreseen boundaries, it fails to do it with any form of success. It's vile, full of boring dialogue, and a movie that should be skipped by even those who can stomach its atrocious premise.",0
13,"I love sick films, but this movie was just retarded.  100 % medically accurate?  Really?  Tom Six is known for a horrible film about gay guys, and I think 300 people saw that.  So he decided to put his face on the map with this art-house crap, that isn't artistic, but it is crap.  Feces, though fun to say, does not make a movie.  It's not really graphic, it's not scary, it's not well-acted, and it really isn't that disturbing.  The idea of it is, but it's just another way to kill people.  In reality, parts b and c wouldn't last more than a day or two.  If that...  wow.  What a sh!t film.",0
15,"Could not bear to watch, scarred the surface of my brain. Gross and gruesome, not for the faint-hearted. Giving a 2 out of 10 for score is dedicated to Dieter Laser, playing the role of the sadistic character, Dr. Josef Heiter.",0
16,"Tell you what. If you don't like this then you don't 'get' the whole body-horror genre, and David Cronenberg may as well have made 'Boo!' films like Halloween. Watch the film, which is deliberately minimalist, and imagine yourself in the middle-girl's position. That's why the film works. This is a horror movie which reaches inside you and twists and tugs at your primal fears, not just the fears that occupy your conscious mind. This is true horror, which didn't even need gore to work. This film is more Clive Barker than Steven King, and I can give it no higher praise than that.",1
17,"This movie is definitely for the ""horror film junkie"" It's been along time since I've seen a movie that made me insist on others watching. You just have to have an appreciation for  B movie horror that will literally make you gag, but also has really funny moments. It ROCKS!",1
18," this is a gross movie that takes horror genre a step further into the sick section. no longer is pools of blood considered gross but now, human insanity has taken a unique twist. it is really awesome.",1
19,"This movie could have been a 10, but since the doctor gets off with a painless death I must say its the biggest pile of crap ever made. I hate Tom Six!!!!",0
20,"Accurate?  NOScary? NOWell acted? NOBut I enjoyed this thing from beginning to middle to end! (PUN INTENDED).  Just sit back and appreciate the fun and disturbing nature of this thing.  It's a foul, original horror idea and the villain is a total wacko.  If nothing else, the movie is memorable and makes people talk.  With so much boring garbage out there I enjoyed every inch of this one.",1
21,"After hearing about how sick and disturbing movie this is I was severely let down. This is only disturbing to those who mostly watch Pixar animations, if you've ever seen a properly disgusting cat III flick where everything is shown in gruesome detail this movie will only anger you. Acting is surprisingly not painful to watch, direction & other technical aspects are fine for a horror flick. Too bad the horror itself, which is supposed to be the main thing here, is severely lacking.",0
23,"The Human Centipede Omg Nastey, iv never seen anything like it vile IT good how they done it but its the most vile thing you caould doo. but i feel for the dogs more aha. why would anyone think of doing anythinmk like this ill never no but the worsted film iv ever watch!",1
24,"I may regret this critique, but I thought this film hit the mark, and hit it well. Never have I seen a film that was so repulsive and grossed out the strongest of stomachs! Yet, this film has a sort of finesse about it. Laser gives one of the most grotesque performances I've ever seen and he drives this film to the very end. No, I don't believe you could watch this over and over again, but once you start, you can't stop just for the sole fact of wanting to know what the hell is gonna come next!",1
25,"most people don't seem to like this film because it's tasteless and horrific... DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK THAT IT WAS BY DESIGN????? what were you expecting? when you watch a film about three people being sewn mouth-to-anus, you had better prepare yourself for three people being sewn mouth-to-anus, otherwise, you are a really stupid person and i hate you, but anyway, this is a rather well made and effective horror film, and that's why i really enjoyed it, also, dieter laser showed the same phenomenal acting ability that you could expect from a top-ranking hollywood star, (you know, ones that actually deserve to be labelled 'stars')",1
26," Really, really good. It's like if Tarantino and Miike met up to remake Flesh for Frankenstein. Dieter Laser is stunning and hilarious. The movie is gross, but just gory-gross; the real fun is watching the villain. Yes, this is a character driven movie. About disgusting things. If you have a strong stomach and sophisticated tastes, see it as soon as you can!",1
27,"Oh dear. What a mess of a film, in so many ways. The only reason I've given it a 1/10 is because maybe, just maybe, a very forgiving fan of the Saw movies could derive some entertainment from this. Otherwise, in terms of acting, narrative, psychological intensity, inventiveness, and just about every other aspect of the film, it is a failure.",0
30,That movie was insane. It was kind of funny when the Asian guy had to take a **** I hated the ending. I didn't really like the movie. I'd like those hours of my life back.,0
33,Just terrible. Boring and disgusting. Pointless. The most horrifying thing about this film (terrible acting aside) is the fact that someone actually came up with this ridiculous concept.,0
34,"This movie is poor. The original idea is the only thing holding it up, and if that isn't making you vomit, which it really isn't for most people, then there's just nothing here. As a movie, this is poor. Characters do not get much more shallow than this. You have the blonde bimbos, the crazy scientist and the random asian guy. After the first twenty minutes you begin to realise this movie has no idea what to do with the idea it has, and instead of giving a plotline, the human centipede meanders around aimlessly for half an hour before a bold escape scene. That's it. That's all there is. That is The Human Centipede.That's not a good movie guys, no matter how much it made you puke. There's nothing here.",0
35,"Probably the most disturbing, repulsive, stomach churning film I have ever seen.  Truly horrific but done simply for the gag effect.  The actor who portrayed the ""doctor"" was pretty good but the other actors were terrible.  Characters did unbelievably stupid things.  It was just too much.",0
36,"Truth be told I've only actually seen about five minutes of this movie whilst flicking through the movie channels late one night but can anybody tell me how this can in anyway be considered entertainment? Gory horror is one thing (I'm not a fan personally) but The Human Centipede takes things to a whole new level. I'm not quite sure how anyone could look at the plot for this movie and still want to see.",0
37,"This is easily the worst movie ever made. From the start, you regret watching this cinematic abortion. The image of the human centipede is one of  the most disturbing thing you will ever see. Watching this movie makes you wonder if there is hope for humanity in the future. It makes you wonder if there is hope for the horror genre in the future, or if everything else will just be pieces of **** like this horrible film. This film (I don't even want to call it a film) goes beyond the so bad you want to see it. This is a film so bad that after watching it you want to wash your eyes out with vinegar. It goes beyond torture porn films such as Saw, and creates its own genre. Films this bad will now be known as Human Centipede's. Also, it should have had an NC-17 rating.",0
40,This movie was just terrible. It just has so many things where you ask why the heck is the happening? I mean. I guess the moral of the story is LEARN TO CHANGE A TIRE. or... DON'T DRINK THINGS GIVEN TO YOU BY CREEPY OLD MEN. It lost it's shock value halfway through the movie. It begs the question why they didn't try to separate themselves. I can't believe this was actually made into a full movie and it's just laughable at best. 0/10,0
41,"There's been a lot of interest in this film since it was released. Not to do with the actors, the acting, the acclaim or the director, but because of the gross subject matter. This film will disgust you. It's not completely bad; the scene where the Japanese guy has a moment of meta-awareness and existentialism is almost a good scene. Almost. The film itself is filled with hammy acting, the likes of which you've probably never seen. not to be too harsh, but I doubt anyone attached to this is going to go one to have a stellar acting career. Like the original Saw idea, the whole film is based around a simple premise, the Saw's case, how to constraint a budget by keeping two people in a room for the majority of the film. Unlike Saw, you never really engage in the film in the same way, mainly due to the aforementioned acting. Maybe one day this film will be seen as a B Movie classic. but not yet.",0
42,The most disgusting vomiting trash I have ever seen.  It's barely watchable and the image of the human centipede is one of the most disturbing images in any movie. It's a sick film by a sick director. Make sure you bring a barf bag to this nauseating so called horror film.,0
43,"My head hurts, my mind feels violated, and my eyes are damaged after watching this absolute mess of a film. Painfully boring and unimaginably disgusting. The real sicko is not the guy in the film, but whoever decided this story should be put to cinema.",0
45,"There is nothing good about this film. Director Six claims that his movie is 100% scientifically accurate, but this could not be further from the truth. Incredibly gory, bad and stupid acting, and loaded with movie mistakes, this is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.",0
46,"I want my life back. I now cannot hear the word centipede without remembering this atrocity of a movie. I think I abused someone about this on another website's comment section just for making a centipede remark that had nothing to do with this movie. I was as disbelieving as the characters as to what was going on until the first time the front guy took his first long call. Yes I said it, the one you take after that first cup of coffee in the morning. If do not want to feel violated psychologically, please spare yourself and don't watch this sick s**t. I give it a 1 coz I hear there is a Human Centipede 2 out there so I'll probably need room for a lesser review.",0
48,"Terrible. Disgusting. Ridiculous. Those are the first three words that comes to mind. ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"", directed by Tom Six, is a sick-minded mess. This is an example on how not to make a film. And the worst part is, by looking at the title, I have a feeling that a sequel is yet to come.",0
49,"This Movie Is Very Very Mental..Very Scary But Needs To Be Cleaned Off In BitsDO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU GET SCARED EASILY",1
51,A totally disgusting movie.,0
52,"I was curious about this film and so I gave it a shot. That's really the only reason I'd recommend it to anyone. Besides an intriguing and grotesque concept, the acting is dreadful, the writing is weak, and nothing happens except naked people screaming and crying.",0
55,"Is there a rating for -10. Only movie to warrant a zero. This however managed to do that and isn't only disturbing. It poses a questions. How **** up do you have to be to like this movie let alone make it. Also it poses that ""humans are more **** up than I thought""",0
57,"The  Human Centipede (First Sequence) is so grotesque and exploitive that you feel like you have to take a shower after watching it. Although this is the point of the movie, it doesn't try to connect its disturbing ideas to the real world in any way, which would've made the movie work. Instead, it relies on shock value to make it good. It tries to scream ""cult classic"", but it will never get there.",0
58,"If you are deciding whether or not to watch it, don't watch it. While not as gruesome as I thought it would be, proves that a plot based off one gross-out idea can get tedious. Earns it's points for acting. Also, I won't be going to Germany any time soon.",0
59,"A complete abomination of a bad movie. Terrible, disgusting and just downright bad",0
60,"The Human Centipede is brutal, shocking, and disgusting all in one--- needless to say disturbing. Sure it had these violence scenes, but It's really the idea that's disturbing. Nevertheless this movie is one of a kind, shocking as it is. This is just a movie you have to see for yourself.",1
64,"This movie hols no entertain value whatsoever.The acting is badThe gore is not hereThis isn't shockingthe plot sucks. I am able to find redeeming qualities in bad movies like twilight and worse even, but this is something you don't need to watch. Except if you are drunk with friends, maybe",0
65,"Nothing positive in this ""The Human Centipede"", bad story, bad acting. It's a waste of time watch this film. This shouldn't be classified as Horror, there's nothing of horror in it. It's a very disgusting film.",0
66,"If this is considered the best of the trilogy i cannot imagine how terrible the other two can be. It is not bad because of the gore scenes, i wish in fact it was somewhat shocking but it was boring as hell",0
67,"Vulgar, disgusting, gross, disturbing, and s**t is what this film brings you. It r**es you in the mind and I literally want to punch Tom Six.",0
68,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. This disgusting abomination is the creation of a sick **** who was most definitely high on every substance ever created.,0
69,"An amazing Family movie, I recommend to watch this with kids, this movie has so much to teach. Many people just didn't get the metaphors",1
70,"I'm still wondering why this movie was made. There is nothing good here. The movie is gore horror and is based on this: two girls end up getting lost and knock on the door of an old man who is, actually, a totally crazy old doctor who will arrest the girls with another boy and try to create a ""centipede"" by sewing their mouth to the rectum of the person in front of them. Sounds crazy enough?The script simply runs over medical or anatomy issues without any consideration for our intelligence. Clearly in desperation, the movie simply wants to shock. Its sick, its repulsive, but the truth is that it also brings few truly novelties that do not have equivalent in other horror films. Then you have the awful dialogues, the actors worthy of a low-budget B movie, and a flood of clichés loaded with predictability. Is it worth watching it? I don't think so.",0
71,"The Humans Centipede is extremely disturbing, and for no reason. This film is so terrible. I can't put into words how gratuitous it is.3/100",0
73,Terrible. Disgusting. Ridiculous. Those are the first three words that comes to mind. This whole damn thing is just a sick-minded mess.,0
