0,"Transformers: The Last Knight is 2X MESSIER than Age of Extinction. Every time when Michael Bay directs a Transformers movie, he always add explosions and useless potty humor to make his movie entertaining for his sake. Jesus Christ.. where do I have to start this? Okay, first of all, the visuals and use of CGI were outstanding but at the same time, everything in this movie is ridiculous. Everything from lousy directing, choppy editing, rushed pacing, annoying characters, and the screenplay of this garbage film is cheesier than a Nickelodeon TV movie. Second, HE ADDS WAY MORE EXPLOSIONS!!!! Michael Bay always have a strange fetish using explosions everytime he adds them in every movie he makes. In almost every scene he makes that involve explosions, it does not do anything to make his movies better. Matter of fact, he's making it worser than previous Transformers movies. Lastly, WHY DID HE MAKE THIS MOVIE??!! Bay's motivations is aiming for money and that's pretty much it! The only positive that I can give to Bay is his departure from directing future Transformers movies and that's it. Hey Bay, I can assure you that you will sweep the RAZZIE awards in no time because this movie is a waste of time!",0
1,"It is a superhero movie and if you expect a very different exciting story then you are expecting wrong. All superhero movies have the same basic concept, but the characterization of the concept of transformers and such marvelous acting, direction, action and cinematic visually appealing excellence is something i can enjoy any day. It is one of the most appealing movies and there being so many negative reviews about this movie is unimaginable. I don't know whats wrong with the critics and movie goers. Its only that i guess their expectations from a movie are wrong and hence they are disappointed",1
2,"At least the action, CGI, the Steve Jablosnky's Score are pretty good, but the rest are... forgettable, the plot is confusing, the comedy is akward, but the good thing is that Michael Bay is Not going to direct the next movie. At least is not the worst Transformers movie.. cof cof.. Revenge of the Fallen.",1
3,"""Transformers: The Last Knight"" is a truly wonderful experience with visual effects and a storyline like no other, the bad-ass series continues to reign with Michael Bay's wonderful direction. This is clearly the best Transformers film ever.",1
4,"It's just too messy to enjoy. There's no cohesive story, and the scenes just crash into each other without rhythm or flow. The best way to describe the experience is like watching TV commercials for 2.5 hours.",0
5,"Transformers: The Last Knight is hilarious. Not because it's funny, but because it's ridiculous to the point of eliciting laughter. I was honestly shocked at just how stupid this film managed to be sometimes. After Age of Extinction, I thought there was no way these movies could possibly get worse. Unfortunately, I was wrong.The same basic plot we've seen four times before makes a return, but this time, by hugely convoluted means, the film forgoes all logic and upends the franchise's continuity, clearly for the sole purpose of setting up future spinoffs. Sadly, the action isn't even good enough to make up for any of that.This movie was also shot with like seven different cameras, so the aspect ratio is always shifting. It's incredibly annoying. All of the charm this concept once had is gone, and the only hope of getting any of it back is to completely reboot the series, or to prevent Michael Bay from having any creative input moving forward.",0
6,"A visually stunning, turd of a film.  I enjoyed the first 30 minutes of this film minus some dialogue, then came the rest.  This is a giant mess like the last three, there is so much going on that your head will spin and you just care about anything or anyone.  The dialogue is some of the worst in any Transformers movie with good old Bay throwing in useless scene after useless scene.  Mark Wahlberg is fine, Laura Haddock was an upgrade, Isabela Moner was okay but pointless, Josh Duhamel and John Turturro were there because they were in some of the other one but overall wasted, and Anthony Hopkins was out of his mind.  Overall Bay does it again, a beautiful looking movie with no substance and awful dialogue.  D-",0
7,"While I can say that the Last Knight is a better film than Age of Extinction, with slightly improved CGI and a shorter run time, this film is still a heaping pile of garbage (to put it kindly). The film's writing, story, characters (robot and especially human), and final act/battle are absolutely awful. Even worse, scenes and characters seem ripped out from other films (a chase sequence seems ripped straight from F&F, the little squeaks character is a complete BB-8 type, etc). The action sequences that are there though are so boring and wane in comparison to some of the other films. I pray that viewers don't see this film and give paramount incentive to make more of these embarrassments to blockbuster films and film in general.",0
8,"I went in with low expectations based on the previous films but my childhood love of the cartoon made me want to like it.  The CG was great, they finally slowed down the fight scenes and added more vehicles besides sports cars.  I don't know who the target audience was. The swearing and violence was not for little kids but the humor and dialogue seemed like it was written by a 10 year old.  It had a lot of great (voice) actors saying really bad lines. Hearing Jim Carter (Mr Carson) quoting Ludacris was a disgrace.",0
9,"All the eye candy and fluff in the world couldn't make this film any better. I'm sorry, but I truly tried to keep an open mind. Sadly, I could hardly keep an open eye from boredom. An incoherent plot, pre-school dialogue, irrational characterizations; need I say more. Horrible!",0
10,"This movie is actually worse than I originally anticipated and I wasn't expecting much. The editing is all over the place, the acting is average at best, the comedy is botched and very unfunny, even cringe worthy at times, the action scenes aren't even that well made and the movie had a lot of plot holes. At least the special effects were really good. If you're into CGI action movies that don't make sense with lots of unnecessary slow motion scenes and ineffective drama , this movie is for you. If not, you're better off watching something else.",0
11,"F@CK THIS FILM!! F@CK MICHAEL BAY!!! IT'S FILM IS NOT BAD! HIS F#CKING HORIBLE!!! THIS FILM DESTROY MY 4 DOLLARS!!! 4 F@CKING DOLLARS!! F@CK YOU, MICHAEL BAY!!!",0
12,"Much more entertaining than I initially thought it would be. Yes, it's still a Michael Bay movie. Expect explosions, nonsensical storytelling, and takes on the Autobots and Decepticons that are so bland the characters almost completely indistinguishable from one another provided their names aren't Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. However a much needed change in tone from the last movie and the infamous director not taking things seriously in any way make for a more enjoyable movie than one might expect. Just don't come for the plot or anything other than the action and some cheap laughs.There's a surprisingly large cast of familiar faces involved in this ridiculous new take on Transformers lore. Among them is Anthony Hopkins for some reason. Michael Bay clearly enjoyed having the respect actor around to use, and Hopkins himself seemed to be having a blast despite that starring in a movie like this is him just slumming it at this point in his career. While he still ain't no Labeouf, Mark Wahlberg's character is so much more likable this time around. Something that's due to the plot not giving him any extra baggage hanging around in the form of his character's obnoxious daughter and her useless, statutory rapist boyfriend (no, it's cool. There's this one law...). They, along with the material, aren't here to choke out the actor's natural charm. The material is so much lighter than that of the previous film ""Age of Extinction."" Bay goes for a lot of different kinds of gags and ends up filling the movie with almost wall-to-wall humor. A move that is much appreciated. The plot itself is crazy. It regularly jumps back and forth from different locations and even time periods in an effort to come off as complex. Instead it just feels convoluted. It's easy to lose track of certain characters as they get left behind for large parts of the film only to pop up later. I actually forgot about Cade Yeagers new human cohorts there for a while. Naturally, this isn't the kind of movie you watch for good writing. Michael Bay is known for making movies for teenage boys. Here he really embraces that.The Last Knight is much lighter and surprisingly more diverse than the other Transformers films. You even get some pretty cool action scenes that aren't just explosion fests that rely more on the physicality of the actors. Of course there's also some gorgeous sci-fi scenery. Those underwater scenes are astounding. Ultimately, this is still pretty brainless entertainment. As far as the writing goes, it's the most incoherent Transformers yet. However, by embracing the absurdity and silliness, and just going for jokes and spectacle, Bay crafted what might just be the best Transformers movie yet. For whatever that is worth to you.",1
13,"i loved it, the best one, great story and action set pieces, definitely the best one, i cant describe how amazing this film is, if you have seen the prevoius ones you will have no problem on getting this one, its just amazing, just see it in imax 3D",1
14,"Simply the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Bay manages somehow NOT to make the giant transforming robots the center of the movie! What the hell, nothing is really the center of this movie. NOT EVEN OPTIMUS PRIME. Instead, an ensemble of ridiculous and mono-dimensional human characters are confusingly shown during the story. One of the main characters is a 14-years girl awkwardly portrayed as some kind of sexy, post apocalyptic fighter (wtf is wrong with you man?!). Incoherent, frenetic and chaotic storyline that tries to blend together the following themes: giant alien transforming robot, King Arthur and the knights of the round table, dragons, demons, Merlin, a robot god/sorceress, comedy moments, a planet eating other planets, USA marine forces, secret English society....and Anthony Hopkins.Please, Michael Bay, please stop raping my childhood...I'll give you my lunch money...",0
15,"Well, i loved it, i'm not watching for meaningful experience, but for cool robots kicking and punching other cool robots, its not a intellectual movie by any means and it will never be, but it is one of my favorite franchises EVER",1
16,"This was a GOOD movie! I really liked the start, the story, Anthony Hopkins, and the new characters introduced who brought some spice and laughs.What I didn't really like was the ending, how they mixed everything up becoming a thunderstorm hard to watch and understand, but I don't agree with A LOT of the critics who rate it so poorly.While it's not a 10, I would put this in the worth watching category for this year, definitely doesn't deserve the bad ratings. Anthony Hopkins doesn't deserve being rated so poorly..",1

18,Transformers: The Last Knight is just another pain-to-the-eyes excuse of marketing our beloved Transformers at least near two hours of Michael Bay trying so hard to entertain us all without using already-clichéd ideas from the simpleton past.,0
19,"Horrivel, como de costume, péssimo roteiro, péssima direção e olhe que nem assisti mas ja to deixando aqui o veredito porque ja sei que vou odiar esse lixo tóxico que se tornou desde o terceiro filme",0
20,"I just watched this movie last night and I cannot, for life of me, remember what exactly was going on or what the main story is. Too many side characters with too many subplots. And the jokes coming out of these children are as terrible as their acting skills.",0
21,"An absolute incoherent, dismal lazy mess with atrocious directing, a bumbling script, uninspired acting, poorly shot, not even blocked or thought out action scenes, insulting dialogue...a typical Micheal Bay movie. Terrible. Just out right bad. You will leave the theater with less braincells than when you came in with, and 2+ hours of your life you will never, ever get back. At best, this movie is total schlock.",0
22,"I didn't think it was possible for Bay to make a Transformers movie worse than the second one. This is a huge, sloppy pile of metallic fecal matter. If this is the kind of brainless movie Americans want to see, it's no wonder they voted Trump into office. In fact, this film does a good job of summing up Trump's America.",0
23,"EDIT(after seeing people writing about this): I will never understand the sentiment of not needing good characters or a good plot. Without those how am I supposed to feel anything about whats happening in a movie? Even basic archetypes can work if well executed(like ID4 and star wars). A good, compeling plot and a good character you can care about are not necessarily oscar worthy masterpieces as long as passion and love for the project is involved. These can tie a movie together. Bay does not seem to care about these at all. Just make the next one and be done with it. Just throw in racist and sexist jokes, some pretentious attempt at diversity(im neither SJW or a feminist), and american army and thats it. All done by the numbers. The movies are not even about transformers! The girl you see in the trailer rivals the boy on the phantom menace. Its there by chance and does nothing. The movie is full of unfunny, juvenile jokes, like that one friend you have that just keeps making fun about anything and saying unfunny jokes. TF5 is just a compilation of CGI demo reels, shameless product placement, and america military pornography. And people keep paying for it!",0
24,"Wow.... I've watched every single Transformers movie and this is by far the WORST one in the series. I brought my friends to watch it and one of them fell asleep for half the movie while the other ones are just so bored of it.Nothing makes sense for these movies and this is going to a real insane lvl and it really defies logic. It's so hard to even find something good to say about this movie; even when the action scenes seem really cool and in a big scale, I didn't feel the immersion for it like in other movies...The decepticons get nerfed so hard in this movie especially Megatron and the main villian Quintessa doesn't even pose a threat; she led to her to own demise by even holding cybertron at that very spot!The main highlight for this movie was ofc the fight between bumblebee and Optimus; I think that was the only part I was engaged and thought it was alrightIn the end Transformers the Last Knight is horrible... Like really really bad. 1/10 is for the effort they put in but in reality this is really a 0I can't even call this a movie.... Someone pls save the Transformers Franchise xDAnd DO NOT CONTINUE where that post credit scene left off; I rather a see a entire new reboot to the franchise and giving the movie to good hands instead of Michael Bay",0
25,"If I had to describe the movie in one word it will be ""cliche"". The whole plot is a cliche. The movie was so long and boring, I could've spent those 3 hours much better than this.",0
26,"I am a big Transformers fan, the Michael Bay films have generally appealed to me to a certain degree up until now, but The Last Knight is just pure rubbish. It comes close to Suicide Squad levels of bad.Let's just agree that the first Transformers film was great. Thought Revenge of the Fallen was bad? At least it had Jetfire and the Fallen, it could have been better if it wasn't victim of a Writers Union's strike at the time. Thought Dark of the Moon was crap? At least it had Sentinel Prime, Shockwave, the giant Worm and Cybertron but didn't feature Devastator's metallic balls or the twins. Thought Age of Extinction was a joke? At least it had the cool Dinobots and Cybertronian spaceships with giant magnets. But The Last Knight is even worse. It's the worst Bay-directed Transformers film by far.It's a series of nonsensical character plot arcs which are either forgotten later or thrown in the film in an atrocious way. No spoilers ahead, it's all in the trailers already. If you mix up King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, Merlin the Magician, 3-headed Dragons, giant spaceships, a female English Historian who looks for a man, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg's character) who just so happens to be single, a teenage girl, an English Lord and his Transformer butler, a human anti-Transformers paramilitary group named TRF, the Quintessons, and the Transformers, plus Michael Bay, you get The Last Knight.Light spoilers ahead (no, not really). For some reason the TRF decide to make a deal with Megatron who asks for the release of some of his captive Decepticon comrades with laughable names such as Nitro Zeus and Dreadbot, but (unless I missed it) humans asked for nothing in return. The film's Writers even go so far as to make Antony Hopkins' character a member of the ancient, centuries-spanning ""Witwiccan Order"" to make fun of Samuel Witwicky (aka former Transformers lead actor Shia LaBeouf, who was fired just like Megan Fox). End of light spoilers.OK we know the Bayformers film series never had any serious plot, but at least they always had spectacle which WOWed the audience. The Last Knight lacks even that. Sure there are robots bashing each other, but the fights are boring. There are scenes where everyone is firing their guns at the enemies but it seems more like they are shooting at nobody really. Then there is the torn apart Cybertron in all its giant-pile-of-rubbish glory. And there is a scene (as well as in the trailers) where 6 enemy robots place their heads in such a wonderful position for Optimus Prime to effortlessly cut them off in a single sword swing, and he's supposed to look badass but I just thought it was bad cinematography by Bay. Oh, the film even has Hot Rod in it but if you were waiting to see the Rodimus Prime storyline unfold you are wrong. The name of any robot in the Transformers films series means nothing, you could name them anything you wanted to but it's up to Bay as to what to do with them.The only (maybe) positive thing in the whole movie is the Marvel-esque mid credits scene which is a tease for the next Transformers movie.All in all, The Last Knight is a really bad film, even by the Bayformers low standards. There is going to be a 6th film for sure, but I hope Michael Bay stays true to his word and doesn't come back. I 'd rather see a complete Transformers film reboot. Start it all over, get the Transformers mythos right, and pretend the Bayformers films never existed.",0
27,"Transformers: The Last Knight is a movie filled that has no story and no idea what is it trying to be. From the very beginning it was going so fast it wanting to start the movie but it just got boring from then on. I might not be on the right here or where are my facts, well the fact is, the movie is boring, bad, bland and it's just a terrible. ""The last knight"" it's like five seconds of telling who it is but doesn't explain it after that. They probably do, but I wasn't listening because it was so freaking boring. The writers are terrible, who asked seven writers to tell this story. Each will have their own say and just give it to Bay like,"" Hey we just got a new scene to put in the movie can you put it in?"" He do, and then theres all these other writers wanting what they want. It just a mixture of everything that goes nowhere. Megatron is horrible, this part is hilarious though, they tried to make a suicide squad movie in it and it could've been more interesting then the movie that I was watching. Please watch something else if you can, if you like these other kinds of movie, then go ahead this is only my opinion. You might ask, ""Why go watch it if you know it's going to be bad?"" Well  I try to open my eyes and see how things can improve if it doesn't then here I am. Bad movie! Bad directing! Bad acting! Bad editing! Writing and Film in total. Nothing has improve, it's all the same.",0
28,"This might actually be the worst movie I have ever sat through in my life. This is just a product, solely made to make money. You can tell that the filmmakers didn't care about the quality of the movie. It's lazy, formulaic, lacks any kind of tension and just comes off as visual noise. I hate this movie. I hate everything about this movie. The convoluted plot, the atrocious dialogue, bland acting and a jarring aspect ratio made this agonizing to get through.",0
29,"Вы уж простите, что я пишу на Русском, но я с удовольствием хочу прокомментировать этот ( шедевр) как бы грубо не звучало для многих, Да я фанат этого фильма,  и его первую серию  я смотрел с невероятным  интересом, я не смотрел мультфильмы, я сразу начал смотреть  фильм, и мой дух невероятно захватило, заворожило и т.п я влюбился в это кино, и пересматриваю его по 20-30 раз   запоминаю фразы,  действия. Многие говорят мол нет сценария, мол  актёрская роль плохая, я считаю обратное. По мне это самый интересный фильм про инопланетян( ведь всё-же автоботы не люди, а пришельцы), а так как по пришельцам мало каких фильмов есть, и актёров которые знают толк в этом особо не подберёшь ! НО вы только  посмотрите и подумайте, А КАК БЫ ПОВЁЛ СЕБЯ ??? разве не так бы суетился  как Марк Уолберг? или не так бы старался помочь тем кого вижу 1 раз, но понял что это добро, которое старается защитить землю, жертвуя собой ( как  Шайа Лабаф). А сценарий?? Вот вы представьте на землю упали неопознанные объекты, пусть даже не в США, мир будет волноваться, и выясняется что есть добро и зло, сначала мы поможем добру победить зло, но зло не кончается, а ущерб  городам, не хилый, машины, здания, и даже человеческие жертвы, и САМО собой правительство должно будет  защищать людей, а значит и убивать мирных, те что сражались за людей, не имея понятия что такое быть человеком, а некоторые люди жертвуют собой ради спасения них, так как они видят что эти автоботы спасали их, жертвовали собой ради людей, и само собой так и должно было бы быть! Автоботы уважают своего лидера, Оптимуса Прайма, и только попробуйте сказать что он не достоен уважения, он лидер!! Он смелый, он мужественный, он тот кто готов ответить за свои поступки, которым есть оправдания, ведь он не был виноват! Но, но как не странно люди спасают его  НЕ СМОТРЯ НИ НА ЧТО. Да роботы, да взрывов много! и почему вас это удивляют? Трансформеры это те роботы у которых много оружий в себе( они его трансформируют) от сюда снаряды, от сюда много взрывов при снаряде, прошу вас, не критикуйте так сурово, посмотрите глазами тех людей что на экране, будто это реальность, сколько там мужества и героизма? МНОГО и поэтому я прошу вас уважайте немного это творчество, это не просто такое кино как в России придумают, там очень много спец эффектов, да изображения не меняются с 1 части, меняется немного стиль, НО сами роботы и с 1 части выглядят очень реалистично, одно но то что из небольшой комару или того мерса не маленький такой робот получается, может быть тут я что то не допонимаю, но смущяет только это, НО В целом я даю и буду давать всегда этому фильму 100000000/10 потому что  в нём есть всё что нужно для экшн фильма, спасибо за внимание.",1
30,"If Mark really cared about building his brand... which seems overly important to too many actors; this film would have been better. As a talented guy it seems like he would have cared more about his performance, even if it is a crap movie. My second question is: are these movies HORRENDOUS on purpose? Yes.",0
31,"Am I the only one that thinks this film is amazing. I was really worried for this film because I saw things in the trailer that I thought would ruin the film for me and by the low scores. But I was surprised by how good the film really was when I walked out. And it turned out to be 1 of the better films in the Transformers franchise. All I can say is if you liked all the other Transformers films, then you'll like this one too.",1
32,"Story is overblown and convoluted with no true character motivations as most characters flip flop constantly. Focus is more on the humans than the Transformers in this, as a retelling of Arthurian legend and destiny. Evil Optimus, or Nemesis Prime as he was called by the main baddy, is only evil for an 8 minute battle at the end of Act 2 whose climax is basically ""Save Martha."" While there are the usual explosions, action, and teenage boy humor, it all falls flat. It's best to skip this.",0
33,"VFX: Superb, Cinematography: Chaotic, Story: Why do they always link it to WW2? like wtf, Dialog: Awful (everyone says **** at the same time, it's like going to a parliament meeting), Actors: Anthony Hopkins and Isabela Moner are good, Sounds: nice, but in Imax the explosion becomes too boring, sometimes painful, too loud (I sit in the middle btw), Recommendation: Watch it when you have nothing else to do.",0
34,"Michael Bay has reached rock bottom with this one. Everything about this movie, from the incoherent story to the bland characters, is just plain atrocious. Easily a strong contender for the worst movie of 2017.",0
35,"""Transformers: The Last Knight"" was a film that was not to everyone's satisfaction, the story was bad, by no means had to do with the title, instead of titling, ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" This movie must be titled ""Transformers: The End of the World"" terrible performances, and excessive use of special effects, which were also lousy, undoubtedly the worst movie of the summer, and one of the worst of the year.",0
36,"I DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE? They advertise that Optimus as an antagonist but it lasts for 5-10 minutes?! What was the point of the little girl as well? Why does the TRF exist now, they want to eliminate the transformers but didn't the CIA want to do that under the books in 4 and now the government is doing it? Also, now they are trying to get Cybertron over to earth again, didn't they try this already?Explain this movie to me please. Gave it a 3 for the cars, effects and all that transformers jazz.. otherwise I get why it's rated so low.",0
37,"At this point, anyone familiar with this dead horse of a franchise should be well aware that they're getting what they pay for with these movies. Loud, mindless action with robots clashing and debris flying everywhere, little to no story, abysmal dialogue (with this film setting a new bar for that standard), and more and more explosions from none other than Michael Bay, who does it better than anyone else! Needless to say, this is exactly more of the same, and I personally found this to be the worst installment thus far! The nonstop action and mindlessness of it all had my restless leg syndrome kicking in full gear not even halfway through the film. The dialogue and corny moments with the characters in the film hasn't felt this absurd since some of the most truly awful moments from the second film, and the talent of all involved is simply wasted, there's no other way around it. It's bad enough that Mark Wahlberg felt the need to involve himself once again with this nonsense, but Sir Anthony Hopkins!? What was he thinking!?!?!? Overall, for those who still somehow enjoy the mindlessness of this franchise, great. For those possibly looking for redemption or getting their hopes up that this is somehow better than the previous installments in any way possible, steer quite clear.",0
38,"After the messy Age of Extinction, I did believe this would be a big step in the right direction. But no... Just a LITTLE bit... BAD character progressions, scenes that are thorn apart by bad editing, feels like 5 different movies, lame humor (they had to destroy Hopkin's character and his butler whit that stupidity) and the story is just idiotic... Some great action, but not good enough to justify this mess.",0
39,"Critics says Transformers is HOT Garbage of the summer and I thought Age of Extinction was boring but this!!! what the heck was Michael Bay thinking and how can people love this,this movie has a 4 user score.. in a nutshell: You can't have a Michael Bay film without Action scenes and EXPLOSIONS and CGI-Crazy pace-Boring Story-Cool Opening-I think I saw a horse did a backflip-The little girl from the trailers was barley in it.-Optimus was Evil for 5-10 Minutes+Cool Cars-TRASH DIALOUGE-Dragged out plot points of the history-Bad/stereotype jokes-Editors were on crack with the Pace of the story-They screwed the Transformers lore of Decepticon with Unicon as Earth-Vivian another Hot Megan Fox that Bay Bang to be in the movie-Makes no sense that Cybertons impact did not Destroyed the earth-Optimus and Bumble Bee's fight was nothing but a backgroundYou will cramp your pants talking about this movie on how bad it is on the end worst movie of 2017",0
40,"I didn't go to this movie expecting a brilliant story.  What I did expect was to be entertained.  I was not entertained. This movie was an absolute bore and about an hour too long.  I never thought the words boring and action would ever be used together.  But that is exactly what it was ""boring action"".  The story was convoluted, long and drawn out. My 8 year old fell asleep twice and I was actually happy he did. My 9 year old begged to leave early.  This was truly awful. Completely uninteresting.",0
41,"well, I didn't have anything to share about this movie. The reason why I gave 5 before because this movie have a good action scene but I have to take it back to 3 or 4 because the director always giving to the audience the ""Same Movie"". But CGI is not good or not bad either --> (-)mediocre",0
42,"Transformers the Last Knight is the Transformers franchise going through the motion again, running out of steam.  It has zero continuity between the films, and while seeing the Transformers many years ago was a great novelty, here it is simply a slog to go through. Bay is obviously a talented director, but his tenure in this series is just way past overdue.  He has nothing more to offer.  I simply cannot fathom seeing another installment of this franchise in the cinema again.",0
45,"This film starts with a flashback scene that wasn't even somewhat needed. Normally a film would follow the tried and true 3 act structure, but Transformers 5 is different. It goes introduction, build-up, climax, build-up and then finally climax again. Another issue is the overlapping stories, at the start, it feels like there are 3 stories, a few minutes in they cross, then they split again but into 2 stories. They cross again at the end but it was so sloppily done that for a while I'd forgot I even had the criticism. This has to be one of the poorest, messiest laziest films I've ever seen.",0
46,"A terrible mess, a lot of information to process. Not saying that is too complex to understand, i am saying that is too trash that you don't wanna see the screen and try to understand.",0
47,"Transformers: The Last Knight is ""not that bad"" but it feels like, it's getting annoying. The Autobots and the Decepticon are not the way as it is before. There attitude has change, there forms (Bumblebee Magnets Parts something) and there language (toxic). Well, I respect that but that just my own opinion. The story and the settings are not that bad actually and the new Bumblebee, Optimus Prime and Drift looks is really outstanding but Megatron, shame. New look but a 1 Karate Kid Kick from Optimus Prime killed him instantly, why don't you let him flee and show up on the next Transformers movie? That's for it. Nicely done.",1
48,I liked this movie but its not a 10/10 but im voting it as a 10 because it definitely  deserves more the 4.0. The acting is not half bad and there are some funny moments. The CGI is well made and the action is well presented without being over the top. For me this was a perfect movie to watch at home with a bag of popcorn and just letting yourself be entertained without having to turn the brain on.,1
49,Transformers: The Last Knight is probably my favorite in the series so far. I thought the story was written better than the previous three and the characters were a lot less annoying. The CGI and sound design were perfect. My only real flaws are the really bad green screen in some scenes and some bad writing.,1
50,"The only reason why this gets 3 outta 10 is probably the effects and the sometimes good humor... The rest of this movie is F###ED UP! The literal first 30 minutes are pure nonsense - you're like: When exactly does this movie start?I loved every bit of the older transformers, not cuz of the brain dead story but cuz of the scenarios, the battles, the ambiente - the effects! What I get in this movie are massive effects but one of the worst writing - it actually pissed me off! That's how bad this was... I don't even want to rewatch this movie!!! Don't watch this!",0
51,"(mild spoilers) saw the movie 1 hour ago. i have to say after seeing everyoone of them in Cinema besides the 1st (saw T3 in 3D). after watching T4 which was ok and could be a little bit better, T5 was brilliant, they focused more on the main plot, added more swearing and jokes that worked at the right time, they killed off some of the funny decepticons and added more autobots (more quips) they made Hot Rod a bad ass, and with Cod he was something the franchise needed. though the trailer is basically the whole Optimus fight scene as it was basically only 8 minutes or less. there was less side story unlike the 4th one and with the 2 hour & 40 minutes, it made the story more worked on. the visuals just as good as all the other movies, and glad they kept old favourites (Wheelie returns). and then they added Mohawk, one of the funniest decepticons (and smallest) well he died after a few scenes). the rest ill leave you to watch it yourselves.",1
52,"It's really trendy to dislike Transformers films right? The last one was rubbish, however my 6 year old son loved it . There's a lot of I don't understand what's going on"" reviews,  Both I and my 6 year old son followed it with no problem, this has the most accessible, simple plot of all the movies, other than the first. The characters are funny, the Autobots are colour coded for easy identification and the Decepticons get an intro sequence each. Anthony Hopkins is funny, I gather he actually likes transformers? There's too much swearing and too much sexual innuendo for the 5 to 12 year olds that will love this, this film should have aimed to be PG(Au rating).All that said, this is the best of all 5 transformer films.",1
53,"This is the worst transformer yet with great visual effects , (even stunning) but all the rest is just garbage , garbage , garbage , garbage , garbage , its were the tranformers belong now",0
54,"It's so ridiculous to see that most people still go to cinemas watching a Transformers movie expecting a decent plot and characterizations..... I've given that up since the second movie. These movies have always been about explosions and big robots beating the **** out of each others, and this movie excels at it. Since this is a Michael Bay movie, it's gonna get blasted by critics (And many people) anyway. The third act's probably the best since Dark of the Moon, and the visuals are as good as you can get (Its special effect is much much better than the overrated Fast and Furious franchise). As always, the main problems are the humans, the plot, and the dialogues. But hey, like I said, I never went to the cinema watching a Transformers movie expecting any of those points to be good. Explosions and Robot fights are satisfying enough for me. We've had (Beauty and the Beast, GotG 2, Wonder Woman) and will have many other potentially good blockbusters with good storyline and decent characters (War for the Planet of the Apes, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Despicable Me 3, Dunkirk, Star Wars, Thor 3, etc.). For now, let's enjoy the junk food Michael Bay has served us.",1

58,I honestly don't get all the hate on this movie. This was the first Transformers movie we've had in a while that did something original. The Transformers woven through our history combined with the new setting our cast will have to traverse in this movie was a joy to watch. Yes I think you have to be a fan of these movies to be able to enjoy this one. Still I think this movie gets way too much hate,1
59,"Fans of the previous movies should like this one. It's a Transformers movie so you can expect nonsensical plot line and a bunch of loud action sequences and explosions. IF those are your things this movie is a 10/10, if not then a 4/10.",1
60,"Just ... outright terrible. Really, this film made me just wanna go out of the theatre as soon as possible (even though I chose a class of seat that was expensive). There's absolutely no plot coherence, and no sensible things between the scenes making it very confusing. In fact the only good thing in this movie was the CGI (being a science-fiction) ... But that's it, nothing else. Really, I could've spent the money for either a better movie or something else",0

62,"Lunatic and wide scenario, magnificent visuals and effects. One of the best movie in the last three months. It isn't possible to understand such hatred; there is no other explanation for being a Decepticon in giving low grades. All the movies that have appeared in recent times were terrible, you still can not get used to it? What were you expecting for? This movie is a gold in your movie rubbish. Better than Mummy, Pirates of the Caribbean, Guardians of Galaxy. It was great to watch this after watching King Arthur. New movie will be about the Unicron, it is best to you stop hatred and go watch Captain Underpants; because you can't understand the labor and beauty. It is really embarrassing for such a large scenario, great designs and drawings to hate vomiting. Quintessa's stages are enough to give me 10 points. Merlin saves King Arthur with alien scepter before 1600 years - Cybertron is trying to merge with the Earth from where it is, only in one movie progress. I am very curious whether if low score markers can do better.",1
64,"At first, I was looking forward to this film in a good way but this Movie really disappointed me. I was sitting in the cinema and was working on my self not to fall asleep. Really bad story, anoying characters and boring action. The only good point on this movie (and for this I give this one Point), is the humor. There are some really good lines in this movie. Except for those like ""I stich like a bee"". This was really bad. By the way, the movie has one good character and this is the Butler. His humor is really good. But aside of this, the movie is just crap and 149 Minutes is really too long. My advice: Don't watch this crap.",0
65,"Despite a fleeting moment of genuine impending doom during the third act, Transformers: The Last Knight suffers from an incomprehensible plot, cringe-worthy dialogue, jarring aspect ratios, puzzling action, and choppy editing.",0
66,"It is boring, despite being the shortest of the sequels, it does not end anymore! The action scenes are based on only explosions and nothing interesting happens and so 2 hours and a half feel, but all the stupid dialogues and the gags that only 1 or 2 get to work; the CGI quality dropped and it shows in many scenes; the script is not only incoherent to the ridiculous point but it has the same plot as the previous ones (and there are a lot of similarities with The Dark Side of the Moon but I do not want to make a spoiler). As for the performances, it's a shame to see Anthony Hopckins doing the ridiculous thing. A movie that neither to pass the time is. I do not recommend it at all.",0
67,"In first 40 seconds, you can already see that this movie will be stupid. After 7 minutes of watching, you are already laughing what a garbage movie this is. At the 12th minute, you are throwing up for 2 minutes because this movie is such an abomination that 5000 characters are simply not enough to describe it...",0
68,"I feel like this movie should be used as a way to torture someone without technically violating their human rights. The Last Knight is deeply insulting to film as a medium and an art form. It's representative of the entirely cynical, money-driven agenda that Hollywood has been really pushing in the last few years. I really don't even want to go into it, but this movie actually truly insulted me. I had three borderline mental breakdowns while I was watching this movie. Three. I saw it almost half a year ago now when it came out and I genuinely still often think about it genuinely terrible it was. It changed me. Don't let it change you. F*ck Michael Bay.",0

74,"I'd actually rate it a 7 but I want to counter-balance all the hate. This film is not worthy of being trashed so badly. It knows what it is and it delivers on that promise entirely. It's a film about robots that turn into cars and planes bashing each other. What more do you want? If the premise of King Arthur's victory being due to a giant three-headed alien transformer dragon raining fireballs upon a medieval battlefield does nothing for you, then you aren't this film's target audience. Sorry, goodbye. Go watch something with more of a pedigree.The one thing I would have changed in this film would have been to have more/bigger/better one-on-one duels in the third act (other than the Optimus/Bumblebee fight, there aren't any drawn-out epic one-on-ones to compare to the climaxes of TF2 and TF3). The big climactic scene is really well-done otherwise, and the humans get a chance to shine in the battle as well, but it still feels like something's missing in the payoff. Other than that, this is definitely not that bad of a film. The budget really shows and the technical aspects really shine (visual effects, sound design and editing, etc). Sir Anthony Hopkins really dives into his performance in a way that classes the whole thing up, and his Transformer butler provides a really fun comic foil. The cast in general was pretty solid, and even if the writing wasn't always up to the challenge of providing them with fun things to say, it's definitely a step up from ""Age of Extinction"".The story in general is quite fascinating in how far it goes for broke and, much like previous films in the franchise, there's plenty of ridiculous references to aliens molding/shaping human history, conspiracy theories, secret societies, Stonehenge being the center of a portal, etc. I enjoyed all of this stuff, though, maybe because I'm okay with occasionally turning my brain off to enjoy what I can out of a stupid movie that knows it's stupid and only wants to unabashedly entertain and dazzle with audio/visual magic.Also, there's apparently a scene after the credits that I missed that is really weird/silly.",1
76,"The last movies of Transformers had at least a story that had some logical sens and somewhat flowing events. Here you have a bunch of scenes stick together that constantly breaks the flow of the movie or render it unwatchable because it create a lot of chaos and distraction. There are too much side characters that have small roles and almost no impact on the overall story. The acting is boring from one end to another. A lot of shouting by the way. The FX are excessive, unfocused and with bad camera angles. On top of that the scenes often switches to one place to another with almost no good transitions. The editing is failing really big here, but maybe the original material wasn't that good to start with... I give 10% because Anthony Hopkins got paid.",0
77,Another trashy sequel film about these annoying fighting robots used to line to coffers of the film industry. No attention was made to quality and frankly I don't think they ever cared.,0
78,"Full of action, has a good story and contains plenty of references that only fans will understand. Some characters could of had a backstory but some of the film was edited out due to its length.

81,Bay at his best in his final Rock em'sock em' robots thrill seeker. This movie is pure junk food and eye candy for all viewers. An amazing spectacle that didn't fail to disappoint. Mark Wahlberg and Sir Anthony Hopkins at their absolute best in this one. An action packed film that featured a great story. I cannot wait to see the Transformers Cinematic Universe move forward.,1
82,I liked the actions. SO much Hype and Excitement. I have been waiting for an average film of not to good or bad. The Battle is so violent but still fun.,1

84,"I always have low expectations but generally enjoy the transformers films but this left me disappointed. Bay was too busy trolling fans to even bother to make it dumb fun. It's just dumb and insulting to fans. They seriously need to stop humans Vs Transformers fights. It isn't what I want to see. Autobots Vs Decepticons, it isn't difficult.",0

88,"It's hard to write about the next part of this series as a film because it looks like a super-slicked one with a great slide show that has no plot. It is not known if any scene was shot on an adequate shooting schedule because it seems to me that all the actors were on a green screen all the time. Except for the effects and tiring noise of the explosions, I did not notice anything else, and it was a shame because the first 3 parts I really liked.",0
89,"The fifth film represents Transformers at its lowest. In this mess of a movie, none characterisation exists, and all characters attain a point where they anoy. The death of Anthony Hopkins actually releavs the spectator from a pain to watch. Pity that an excellent veteran actor sells himself to **** Mark Wahlberg's performance is maybe his worst, as well as the rest of the actors. Now let's talk about the plot. There is none. It feels like a cheap reboot(although it costed 260 million dollars in its making) of the fourth last films, and feels even like a parody of those and Bay's filmography in general. Your brain tries in vain to understand between hours of exposition and scathological humour that makes a cacophony of sounds, between bad jokes of strippers and sex. Although this is redeemed by the always beautiful score from Steve Jablonsky. Dialogue feels forced, as well as the story, which doesn't flow at all. Optimus Prime, as well as the other transformers, are totally secondary and doesn't feel like characters, and scarcely appear. Their dialogue makes them look like idiot children, and the grandiloquent sentences of Optimus Prime are forced and clichéd. There is a surprising little amount of action in this one, and when there is, it lasts little and is nauseating, except for some decent ones with Optimus Prime and an incredible one at the beginning. Transformers 5 is the worst in the series. It gains points, though, for its feast-of-the-eye special effects, Cogman's character, which is maybe the best idea they had for the sake of this **** piece of **** and some of the mythology that takes place in the Middle Ages.",0
90,"It's clear (about half an hour into the film) they are putting some effort in putting some new stuffs into this franchise, like the King Arthur-Knight-Merlin stuffs. CGI is good. The plots are alright but lacking depth, and illogical in some area. The worst parts about the movie are the cheesy 'bad' jokes ridden throughout the movie, to the point it severely bring down the movie to mediocrity. Because of the terrible 'bad jokes', I felt compelled to give this a rating of '2', otherwise I would give the film a rating of '4'. This film is watchable if you keep your expectation low.",0
91,"Honestly, what is there to say about this dumpster fire? Just a typical Michael Bay film, where it's just more of the same: same loud, pointless action sequences, excruciatingly boring characters, and just plain bad writing. This movie has ZERO heart, and it is painfully obvious from the start.Michael Bay represents everything wrong with modern day Hollywood. IDW Comics have proven that Transformers has the potential for compelling stories and interesting characters, and it is all wasted in these god-awful films.",0
92,"This has to be one of the worst films I have seen in many years. And I've seen a quite a lot of movies.The feeling of wanting to turn off the movie multiple times throughout the movie is strong in this one. The plot had no depth to it at all. No red thread throughout either. And don't get me started on those so called ""emotional scenes"" with some characters. Trying to connect you with some of the main characters only to last 15 seconds(I am not kidding), and then followed up by 50x new explosions. Yes, explosions. If you like explosions, this movies is for you. You will be so pleased, and maybe too pleased with how many there are. I bet, even the most explosion fanatic would start to yawn 15 minutes in, begging it to stop in real fear of epileptic seizure.",0

Cybertron, along with a three-headed metal dragon, helped the knights of the round table triumph.

115,"This is just sooo bad on every level. Why can’t Michael Bay realise that Transformers doesn’t work anymore. Far too long, stupid acting, the action is boring and once again that trademark Bay thing, he likes to blow things up a lot. There is just nothing in this film that works. The story is just ridiculous. And it’s such a shame cos there is at the end a giveaway to another transformers film. Oh no not again.

121,Best Transformers movie ever. Michael Bay delivers exactly what I was looking for. Too bad he will not be returning to direct Transformers 6. Hyped for the War For Cybertron movie. This was one of the year's best films.,1
122,"The only good thing this movie has going for it is the visuals. The story gets confusing as hell half-way through and after that, it bored me to death. It has tolerable script writing but the number of special effects just ruins the entire atmosphere making this world seem incredibly plastic. After that, the amount of continuity errors for a film of this higher budget is totally abhorrent. For example, Bee was apparently in WW2 and just so happened never to mention it across the previous 4 films, if you are going to add something like that to a character then you need to add some reason for him to not mention it or not show some indication of it. If you've watched the film you'll know that near the end BumbleBee gets his voice back, this could have been used to make BumbleBee speak more normally and allow for some comedic moments where he's getting used to using a regular voice again, but instead they make him speak almost the exact way he did when he had to use a radio, but this time he has absolutely no reason to! This means that BumbleBee is still just spouting irrelevant one-liners, but this time it isn't with his radio voice, making them fit in and not stand out due to him only having a small sample of voices to choose from, and instead with this unbroken voice that sounds like it was done in one take that totally throws off any moment in the movie that was trying to be dramatic.",0

125,"Transformers: The Last Knight: Michael Bay's fifth installment of the endlessly atrocious Transformers franchise is filled with expensive explosions, clichés, cheesiness, and possibly the worst dialogue ever. Mr. Bay, get directing tips from the great Scorsese!Starring: Mark Wahlberg. Anthony Hopkins. Josh Duhamel.Directed by Michael Bay.By Blake Patterson.0/100.   This is one of those abhorrent movies I saw on a website; I only watched it, because I wanted to tell people why Michael Bay sucks. Transformers: The Last Knight's incoherent plot is so goofy that I almost started laughing. Viewers see Stanley Tucci in disguise as Merlin, possibly the worst performance in his acting career, and Bay expects us to not recognize him. Someone should've paid the gifted Anthony Hopkins to be in this detritus; He portrays as a historian, Sir Edmund Burton, who says that there were robots in the medieval era. Burton's robot, Cogman, is a character that plagiarizes C-3PO perfectly; Lucasfilm should sue the crap out of this abomination. People who enjoyed this monstrosity should stay away from Bay's films; I'll make sure to recommend them classic movies.  Mark Wahlberg appears in this film again, and it is said that he is leaving the franchise; Attaboy Wahlberg, you've made a smart movie pal! Bay follows his tradition of objectifying women in this one; Laura Haddock's character is a walking cliché that is supposed to please the men. The dialogue is substandard and corny; At the end of the film, Wahlberg's character says, “You did good bro,” to the young female character in the film played by Isabela Moner. Bay uses more tiring explosions than actual dialogue. Those are the many reasons why this film is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Transformers: The Last Knight is the worst film of the year so far. Lazy directing won't take you far folks!",0
128,"Just please end this abomination. The entries have only gotten worse and worse, and at this point, I'm sure nobody wants this franchise to continue.",0
133,"The only thing good about this movie is that it finally brought an end to this franchise under Michael Bay.  What should've been the easiest action movie franchises to helm, Michael Bay managed to make us hate the transformers.  I hate these movies and hope Michael Bay never touches another action franchise because he is poison as a director.  This movie is plagued with the same problems of every movie and can't escape a terrible director and terrible writers who I think were actually 14-year-olds.  Never watch this movie or series, it's not worth it!",0
134,"slow, boring and meaningless. This movie shows a heartless attempt to make an absurd story about transformers, the only rescatable are the visual effects that are impeccable, but only that, the rest is more than what we have shown in the previous 4 movies, but more stupid and boring.",0
137,"Soulless garbage. Must have been written in less then 15 minutes. How hard can it be to write an entertaining film about transforming alien robots? If you're Michael Bay, very hard indeed. And the jokes. Wow. The jokes. I cringed after each and every one. So many attempts at humour falling flat on their faces and smashing all of their teeth on the floor. The makers of this movie should be forced into exile.",0

139,"So this is the only transformers i have ever watched (aside from Bumblebee, but that doesn't count, does it?). I was never interested in transformers, and the only reason why I watched this film was because the reviews were so bad i had to see it for myself. And let me tell you right now: transformers last knight is one of the worst films i have ever seen.To start of with, the effects range from average, to flat out bad. The acting also ranges from average to bad. All the voices over characters sound like their either half-asleep, blandly reading off a script or both. And as for the actors and actresses, I think it's clear that they knew how much of a train-wreak this film was going to be, and as such, don't put any effort into their acting whatsoever.I'm not going to talk much about the story, because it's basically just robots fighting other robots, but on earth, so you get humans helping or hindering along the way. Like I said, I haven't watched any other transformers films, but I'm pretty sure all of their stories are exactly the same as Last Knight.Their are two more subjects i want to talk about that make this film as bad as it is. First is that it's so boring! I was having trouble keeping my eyes open during this film because it was so mind-numbingly dull. Whether it's a slow scene or a fast scene, it's boring. A talking scene of an action scene, it's boring, you get the picture. And that leads me onto my last point: this is the most unfunny film i have ever seen in my life. Every ""joke"", if you could call them jokes, is like a stab in your ear lobes. You will cringe so hard at the humour/torture in this film.Overall, this film is almost a guide in how to not make movies. Unfunny, bad acting, bad effects and boring as sin.Avoid at all costs, or don't, I'm not your mum, jeez.",0

142,"This movie is horrible. It destroys the transformers franchise, it has a very bad plot. the movie tried to add new things to the franchise, but it fails terribly, it also doesn't feel like a transformers movie, even worse that age of extinction, the only good thing is CCG and Megatron's design, this is just a mess of a movie. the trailers showed a different movie but at last is just a very popcorn movie to see only one time.",0
143,Definetely one of the worst movie i ever saw. There are no such things as 'good' or 'decent' about this film.,0
144,The last knight easily the worst transformers film. This movie has a very hard to follow plot because it is all over the place. This movie has even hard to follow action scenes. Good thing I watched it once never watching it again. Waste of money,0
145,"As someone who enjoyed the other four Transformers movies, it hurts to say I absolutely hated this one. With the other movies, even though the story and characters were not that great, the thing that kept pulling me back to these movies was the Transformers. Watching Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots kick some Decepticon ass was fantastic. Here, there is Transformers action, but it wasn't entertaining like the other movies; quite frankly it was boring. This is the worst Transformers movie by a country mile, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",0
