0,"Hugh Jackman's swan song as the Wolverine is an uncommonly atmospheric superhero film with nuanced performances by its two leads, gleefully gritty & well earned R-rated action and a story by director James Mangold that is moving and deeply personal.",1
1,"'Logan' is the perfect goodbye to these beloved characters. Is bold and unusual, gory and well directed. I would be very pleased if Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart would run for the Oscars next year.",1
2,"I loved this movie. I think that it is the perfect goodbye for Hugh Jackman as he probably did the best portrayal of wolverine he has ever done. Just for that alone, the movie felt great, yet the other actors did a fantastic job as well, even the little girl was a badass. The action was intense and very satisfying, the move for an R rating was the right one, as it gave the movie so much more weight and credibility, even if it was still a movie about mutants. It felt mature, it felt conclusive and sentimentally powerful. The reason I give it just an 8 is because it suffered some pacing issues in my opinion, specially when Logan meets the kids and keeps fading time and time again, and because I felt that adding another Logan pushed the movie into generic territory, it felt kind of out of place given all the seriousness and realism they tried to portrayed in the film, thought I gotta admit, Logan vs Logan was still badass. Go see it.",1
3,"Last year’s Deadpool movie proved there is a market for more adult orientated and violent comic book movies and Logan backs that up with a movie that ranks amongst the best Marvel Studios have created. Set in the near future, in which mutants are no longer born, Logan (aka Wolverine) is driving a limousine for a living whilst caring for an ailing Charles Xavier. When he is contacted by a woman caring for a young girl, that she claims is her daughter, Logan and Xavier are forced out of hiding to in order to help.Logan has is as much a western or a road as it is a superhero film and this really helps set it apart from what has started to become a slightly over-familiar structure for Marvel films. This approach also carries over into the action/fight scenes that, as well as being more bloody and brutal than you’ll see in other Marvel movies, rely less on CGI and are all the more effective for it. Hugh Jackman is as good as ever as Wolverine and the on screen chemistry between him, Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Laura (the superb Dafne Keen) really helps give the movie a further edge by making it easy to actually care about what happens to these characters. If this is to be Jackman’s last appearance as Wolverine he’s certainly gone out on a high note.",1
4,"Good movie, but of course we know what happens next.The next wolverine is a women. As ridiculous as it sounds just think about it and think how entertainment venues such as movies have been influenced by one side.",1
5,"A wonderful addition to the X-Men franchise with great acting. Very much reminded me of X2, though with a lot better action. My one complaint would be that there some plot holes and the timeline doesn't quite match up with the X-Men films, but hey, it's worth the watch.",1
6,"""Logan"" was a good movie, which has respected the essence of the comic, but the story as such was flawed, but with such success, Hugh Jackman has closed his cycle with Wolverime with a golden snap, and X-23 opens the Doors to a new era in the universe of X-Men, the actress Dafne Keen, was the protagonist of the film and awaits a good future ahead.",1
7,"The R-rated Xmen movie 'Logan' is really badass, but the ending is sad because Logan died at the end of the movie. R-rated movie is better than Pg-13 movie. I like Deadpool better than Logan.",1
8,"Logan was a brutal,somber and entertaining film which was different from another other X-Men movie and followed in the steps of The Dark Knight pretty well.Lets talk about how the R-rating worked in this film,i would say for the character Wolverine it was awesome,the slashing(action),gore and language was better because of it but in the beginning it felt a bit forced as the first line of the movie is an ""F"" bomb,but after a few minutes everything felt natural.The plot is very simple and very small which was good as the movie dives into deep character emotions & developments as Wolverine is old and bitter and i found it interesting how he was reluctant throughout the film and was only helping the girl in this movie to like get rid of her,but he isn't all bad as Logan cares for professor X & the their relationship is different from other films and for this dark and gritty movie it was well needed.Although the tone of this movie was dark,gritty & somber there is some humor and fun to be had in this movie even if it's keep at a minimum,were humor was needed the movie did it nicely.The action was on point and i loved every bit of it,from chase scenes to the slashing the action was well done & glorious.Now the characters in this movie all had some purpose and meaning to their roles especially X-23(the little girl who is helped by Logan),she was awesome in her action sequences & her acting was good,Charles Xavier was also good in this movie as it shows him as an old,tired and beaten down Professor X who isn't as wise as he was and it was very interesting to see the growth or struggle of the character.Hugh Jackman was amazing as always as Logan and his character is pitiful,bitter and you almost wonder if he is still a hero as he refuses to help people and doesn't are about anyone expect Charles and doesn't almost care about X-23 and the film portrays & explains why he is like that and it is very satisfying.Another reason why this movie works and why it's so different in the superhero genre is that this film is sad and so emotional especially in the 1st and 3rd act of the movie,and since its a grounded movie the tone works nicely.What annoys me in this movie is the 2nd act whereby the film becomes a bit boring & since it was a more grounded movie it focus on some real world themes which sometimes worked and sometimes didn't & you start to notice that the movie is too long and some scenes that could have been cut out,but other than that the movie is fine.Logan was a fascinating movie full of great action,emotion and depth,this was the Wolverine movie that makes a fitting end to Hugh Jackman's 17 year run as Logan.",1
9,I have to be honest I don't know if there is a good way to describe the movie except saying fanominal and action packed but that being said I will say that I don't think that it is a good idea to take the family it's a good time don't get me wrong but it is very rated R it is full of swearing drinking a nude scene and constant violence but it is a good movie and the kid is just as wonderful as Logan is as a hero go see it,1
10,"8.9Esta es La película de superheroes. Eso en el sentido mas visceral de la palabra. Aunque ya se ha hablado mucho sobre las similitudes que tiene esta obra con una de las más grandes de los videojuegos de la ultima época: The Last Of Us (2013)  Tiene la crudeza y el manejo de la violencia perfecto (aunque en Logan la violencia esta mucho mas exagerada de igual manera se la lleva bien) y un argumento aunque fantasioso de igual manera es maduro.En el sentido del guion yo lo sentí con las suficientes referencias para que un amante de los comics (lo suficientemente no arenoso) le guste y tampoco te sientes perdido si no has visto películas anteriores a esta, ya que solo necesitas saber de Wolverine solo lo de cultura general.En las escenas de acción están repletas de sangre y no están tan sobreexplotadas como otras tantas. Para no entrar en terreno de spoilers las situaciones claves están muy bien desarrolladas y los giros que esperabas están ahí pero de igual manera te van a sorprender.Los personajes son muy memorables y las actuaciones buenas de igual manera, aunque la traducción de Latinoamérica esta regular especialmente en el doblaje ya que está muy mexicanizada lo cual tiene que ver con la dirección de la película, mi recomendación es verla en idioma original, ya que gran parte está realizada en  México y con la traducción pierde escancia . (Hay una situación con X-23 que será recordada por su traducción).En la cuestión de la dirección de arte es absolutamente normal, salvo en momentos clave, nada para recordar.En fin, es una muy buena pelicula de accion y sobre todo con una historia llevadera y memorable.",1
11,"Con Logan no solo tenemo la conclusión perfecta para un personaje tan memorable para el cine como para los comics, tambien tenemos lo que debería ser una apertura.Una para el género que lleva este estigma infantil con el que carga(Marvel/Disney) y que cuando se intenta hacer adulto o serio se vuelve un ridículo completo (DC/Warner).Logan es una película poco comprendida entre la crítica, ¿a que me refiero con esto?me refieron a que muchas de las fallas que se le buscan vienen de su ritmo, de ese road trip que marcan Logan, Charles y la pequeña Laura. pero la películas busca estos momentos intimos, pausados, porque esta peli no trabaja como una peli de acción o de superhéroes, este es un estudio de personaje; “Quien, Como, Cuando y Porque” se pregunta esta película, se pregunta sus personajes y nos preguntamos los espectadores, conocer a fondo a un personaje sin que te lo explique una pantalla de inicio con letras, un flashback revelador.No! aquí hay que fijarse en los diálogos, en los gestos, en su mundo. James Mangold nos mete en ese mundo al instante, ¿dónde están los ley?, ¿dónde están los valores?, ¿donde estan los Hombres X? así es como Logan consigue ese toque Western que se nos prometió, este género se hace estas preguntas, en este mundo tan hostil habrá alguien que se atreva a hacer algo al respecto, Logan lo hará! verdad? Mmm… no.Logan ya no es lo que conocíamos, su factor de curación ya no es lo que era de antaño, lo que en su momento lo convirtió de un mutante al arma definitiva (Arma X), el Vibranium lo está envenenado, su cuerpo cada vez más se le dificulta contrarrestar todo ese material en su cuerpo, sus heridas ya no sanan, las balas duelen más que antes y ese dolor se quedará ahí un buen tiempo, con el simple hecho de sacar sus garras Logan ya sufrió lo suficiente.Tenemos ese retrato de un hombre que no solo sufre físicamente, sino que por dentro está destrozado, ha perdido mucho y lo que le queda por proteger (Charles Xavier) está cada vez más delirante, el arma de destrucción más peligrosa se le hace llamar y no nos olvidemos de Laura, una niña que a duras penas se le puede catalogar así, es una infante que no ha tenido infancia, que el odio ha estado presente en ella porque solo fue concebida como objeto de experimentación, Laura es brutal, los villanos palidecen ante su furia, es lo que en antaño vino a ser Wolverine pero ahora está en el cuerpo de está infante.Es ahí dónde Logan marca una diferencia, nos presenta estos personajes tan famosos y vanagloriados en la cultura y cuando los vemos simplemente la ilusión se desaparece, los baja del cielo dónde están y los colocan a nuestro nivel, con sus problemas, sus flaquezas, estos delirios y depresiones, está furia, esa inocencia. los personajes en Logan no son superhéroes, son personas y esto se siento como nunca en ese género, Wolverine ahora es una persona in-reactiva, ya no busca responder antes los problemas o antes sus agresores, Charles es un demente que detrás de esa demencia oculta una culpa tan grande que él se mira así mismo como un monstruo y Laura tras esa incontrolable furia se esconde una niña, que quiere escapar de su terrible destino como un arma. Nunca antes mire ese tipo de tratamiento. La joya del género es considerada “Batman The Dark Knight” y si entiendo sus razones y es de mis películas favoritas pero en mi opinión Logan tiene un poco más de sustancia.",1
12,My favorite X men film so far. I love how it doesn't have to tender to the little 9 year old's anymore and can aim for a more mature audience. Hugh Jackman is at his best in this film.,1
13,logan is the best superhero movie of all time it tells a great dark gritty movie to end an era of hugh jackman as wolverine i even think it should win at least one oscar in my oppinion 3rd greatest movie of all time behind pup fiction and the shawshank redemtion and who ever you are and if you didnt see the last movies just go see this one logan greatest superhro movie of all time even better than the dark knight,1
14,"The long awaited release of Hugh Jackman's final performance as the Wolverine was amazing, even better then I thought it would be! This movie brings in a perfect amount of action, drama, and time to see Logan and Laura bond on a fun road trip scene. It is loosely based off the ""Old Man Logan"" comic book series but does bring something new to the table that is amazing. Also, the acting is amazing. But to conclude this all, it is a must see for older audiences who are a fan of this hacking and slashing hero and want to see his final chapter. I've watched almost every Marvel movie and I have to say by-far that this is the best Marvel film yet.",1
15,This movie was extremely different from what we have seen from any comic book movie. The action was fun to watch and the story was brilliant. The acting really was amazing. This movie is a must watch for all comic book fans and non comic book fans alike.,1
16,"""Nature made me a freak, man made me a weapon, and God made it last too long.""In a time when Marvel continues to churn out the same superhero film time-and-time again ('Deadpool' and 'Guardians' aside due to their fresh take on the genre), it's refreshing when something as intricate and beautifully-executed as 'Logan' is made, and on the extremely rare occasion I have given a superhero film a ""masterpiece"" rating. I mean let's face it, that first trailer was a dead giveaway of how damn good it was going to be.I understand that Marvel has made the attempt to build characters through a series of films previously, such as they have tried with the Avengers films, but never have I seen a film that treats character development as seriously, and pulls it off with such precision, as they did here in 'Logan', a film that focuses more on the ""humane"" aspect of the character and how vulnerable he is as a superhero, instead of the over-the-top execution that's usually featured ('X- Men Origins' I'm looking at you).Two characters that we've come to know and love, James ""Wolverine"" Howlett (aka Logan) and Charles ""Professor X"" Xavier, are put to the test of time as we see them in their new state, once characters that resembled strength and power, are now withering and vulnerable. And the gut-punching, adrenaline-pumping action has been swapped out for slow-moving, emotional drama and character development. Does it work? You bet! From start to finish we are led on a journey of discovery and empathy, with James Mangold more than making up for his previous effort that is 'The Wolverine'.I think it's the uncertainty throughout that gives the film that powerful punch. In the other X-Men films (and most other Marvel films for that), we are faced with a plethora of superheroes each fighting a seemingly impossible army, but no matter what, there is always a general feeling that the good guys will win, and this usually happens. So when attending a superhero film, you sit back in ease, knowing the protagonists will succeed, however in 'Logan' that never happens, there is never that sense of safety, we can't be certain of their outcomes. Every step of the way, Wolverine looks tired, he looks sick, he's dying gradually, and due to his weakened form, we are left worrying for the character, there is that emotional attachment that most other superhero films lack. This is the harrowing truth throughout, we are emotionally-concerned from start to finish.With utterly stunning cinematography, a hard-hitting score, fantastic direction and a superhero performance that might just be the first Oscar-deserving one ever. Wolverine's outing makes for the best Marvel film to date, a gritty and vulnerable adventure into the vulnerability of superheroes.",1
17,"This is The Superhero Movie. That in the most visceral sense of the word. Although there has been much talk about the similarities that this work has with one of the biggest video games of the last period: The Last Of Us (2013) It has the crudeness and the handling of the perfect violence (although in Logan the violence Is much more exaggerated in the same way it gets along well) and an argument although fanciful in the same way is mature.In the sense of the script I felt it with enough references so that a lover of comics (not sandy enough) likes it and you do not feel lost if you have not seen films before this, since you only need to know about Wolverine only Of general culture.In the action scenes are full of blood and are not as overexploited as others. Not to enter spoiler terrain the key situations are very well developed and the turns you expected are there but they will also surprise you.The characters are very memorable and good performances in the same way, although the translation of Latin America is especially in dubbing since it is very mexicanizada which has to do with the direction of the film, my recommendation is to see it in the original language, and That much part is realized in Mexico and with the translation loses slang. (There is a situation with X-23 that will be remembered for its translation).In the matter of art direction is absolutely normal, except in key moments, nothing to remember.In short, it is a very good action film and above all with a story that is bearable and memorable.",1
18,"At times a bit overly violent. But one of the first comic book hero movies (since The Dark Knight) that is truly spectacular. An amazing hero's tale to shock and stir the genre of future hero movies (hopefully)! The best Wolverine performance that has been and will ever be. Furthermore, it has a perfect conclusion.",1
19,"Really good movie. Emotional, and very skilled storytelling. The action was top-notch and everything fit into each other perfectly. The first half was much stronger than the last half, but both were still very very strong. What a perfect sendoff to both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart.",1
20,"I've never really been much of a superhero film guy because i always feel like the plot is arbitrary and the characters are 1 dimensional and if they do have arcs they just jump straight to their next evolution without any growth towards it. The films are usually just about getting to the next set piece and cutting from mass explosion to mass explosion.Logan luckily gets it right.The film has definite emotional weight due to the script being able to give character interactions more meaning and just give the actors (Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart) more to eat up. The films set pieces have poignancy and conflict within them and captures the brutality of Wolverine. The X-23 character is also played with so little dialogue but done so well that you love all the characters and the way the act with each other. This film is an amazing showcase that superhero films can be great, if they focus on the characters and the plot first and not the big bosses they will soon fight or the biggest explosion they can put in. Sometimes the stakes in a film feel raised for the audience when they are lowered in the film (who gives a sh*t about Apocalypse eh?).Great film and would highly recommend everyone check it out. Genuinely surprised me at moments, moved me and filled me with adrenaline in the action scenes.Brutal, well written and somewhate emotional, despite its ex-positional ludicrousness. Also really nicely ties in the comic books to the plot.8.8/10",1
21,"Fantastically brutal farewell to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. Its about time Marvel made something to appeal to someone other than the kiddies. Easily, easily the best ""comic book"" movie ever made. Got my Noir version ready to go at home",1
22,"Logan is one brilliant film, it’s an excellent send off to the characters and does a decent job, really bringing finality to the franchise.  If 20th Century Fox wants to keep going with the X Men franchise, I think they should just do a total re-boo because this one really should be the last film.  It’s well acted, the action scenes are really good and the plot line, while dark and gritty also works very well and the rumours are not true, there is no Deadpool cameo in the film, thank god, because that would have destroyed the tone.  It’s not fun and it’s not glamorous, but that does not change the fact that it is readly good.  I would really recommend seeing this one, especially if you followed the X Men films, though, be aware, it is a very gory film and it very much deserves its R rating.  Don’t stick around for the end credits as there is no post-credit scene.",1
23,"The best superhero film I have ever seen! Hugh Jackman makes his best performance yet in my opinion. With a super sad ending to the series, we see the real Wolverine.",1
24,"What an excellent film! This is the Wolverine film we've always wanted. With fantastic action pieces and engaging dialogue. Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as Wolverine for sure. The movie was extremely gory and surprisingly had a lot of humor, which was great! Everyone does a superb job in this movie bringing realism and believably to a hard to believe concept of ""mutants"" in the first place. And oh boy what a treat for everyone before the film starts. Ha!.",1
25,"This movie gives me goosebumps thinking about it. It was so good, so entertaining, and so gory. I get that they do fight go fight go and fight and go but they creators of this movie did it so well. I never felt bored or thought ""why'd they do that? I don't like that part."" The movie made it all feel like it was real life. I loved every single character and all those moments you didn't expect to happen but are realistic and don't feel forced. I loved this movie and is my favorite movie of Hugh Jackman. Better than BvS and The Avengers. Maybe even better than guardian's of the galaxy. It's up there with the dark night. For me, it might even be better than the dark night.",1
26,"If you haven't watched this movie, you need to stop whatever you're doing right now and go watch it. That's not a joke. This is honestly the greatest comic book movie ever made. It's breathtaking, emotional, violent, and nearly flawless. Logan exceeds all possible expectations. Brilliant performances by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and a stunning breakout performance by Dafne Keen make this one of the most brilliant movies in recent memory.",1
27,"This was a great take on Wolverine. In many ways its like an old western with a gunfighter that is doomed to die as he cannot change, or like the road warrior who fights even though he will never join the people in the new territory. The mature rating allowed them to show the violence that he has tired of. Logan is not like most others in his circle as his skills are close, brutal, and personal combat. He has always been the one that will do what is necessary, but does not want others to follow his path.",1
28,"Logan is a dark but beautiful tale of the end of the X-men. All stories must come to a close and Logan beautifully closed the first generation of X-men Movies. Set in a not so distant future with realistic technological advances and realistic characters, never before has a superhero move felt so relatable and human. A must watch for any film lover. Though be warned, this movie is violent and disturbing, not for the faint of heart",1
29,"A truly excellent film.  Having grown up watching the Xmen movies and seeing the development of the characters and relationships, this really movie hit me right in the feels.  The relationship between Professor X and Wolverine stole the show for me and seeing them in a dilapidated state was heart breaking.  When the movie isn't making you cry, its giving you a pulse pounding adrenaline rush.  This is some of the best, bloodiest action I've seen in a movie.  The R rating is definitely earned in this.  Please go see this movie.  If you're a fan of the characters make sure you bring your popcorn and a box of Kleenex",1
30,"The final outing of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. Directed by James Mangold-who was also at the helm of ""The Wolverine"" (2013)- Logan creates a character-driven, violent and emotional film, which benefits from its rated-r rating. The acting, action and story of Logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre, as the cast, headed by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newly- introduced Dafne Keen, play their characters to the fullest. It is unlike any other X-Men film, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.When I saw the first trailer drop, headlined by Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"", I instantly knew we would be getting something different from everything else that has dropped since the first X-Men film in 2000. The brutality and intensity of the characters pay off in this almost two-and-a- half hour that redefines the superhero genre, and I hope pays dividends for future movies to come. The introduction of X-23 was a big win as well. She is played by Dafne Keen, and though doesn't say much, plays her role very well. Her connection with both Hugh and Patrick creates a family-orientated environment that makes the movie a whole lot better, especially seen in certain scenes.Lastly, as much as I want the character of Wolverine to continue being played on the big screen, it would be better for everyone if they didn't re-cast the role, as no-one would be able to play the role much like the legendary Hugh Jackman. Overall, Mangold and the cast, create a masterfully orchestrated film that will be remembered for years to come. Not only is it a great film, but it is the last time we will be able to appreciate and witness Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the X-Men universe.",1
31,"This review may seem vague, but it's all in the spirit of keeping spoilers out!-Logan is arguably the best movie in the X-men series to date! It has everything needed for the character to come to life on screen. Logan is foul mouthed, violent, compassionate, and ultimately running on fumes during this chapter in his life. Charles is dealing with severe medical issues, and trying to not kill everyone around him through siezures. Laura is trying to find an identity, but had trouble due to how she was ""raised"". The villains aren't your super powered monsters, but more akin to psychopaths. Peirce and Dr. Rice do what they think is right, but in the worst way possible. The emotion seen from all of the characters, and how they interact may seem hamfisted at times, but for the most part, it's done excellently. A must watch, and DEFINITELY a must buy!",1
32,"This review is from a movie viewer who has not seen the last X-Men Movie:I was surprised how much I loved this movie. It had action, emotion and a great plot. There were barely any references to the previous movies, so I had no obstacles with my viewing experience. The warning is that there is blood... a lot of blood. If you can get past the gruesome death scenes, you will absolutely love this meaning. My true rating of this film is a 8.75, so I rounded up and gave it a nine. This isn't a movie to take the kids, but the adults will absolutely love it. This movie makes me want to rewatch all of the Wolverine/ X-Men movies. Go see it and enjoy!",1
33,"The movie was very enjoyable and had some very good scenes, the movie did fail for me in some aspects, some scenes feeling cliche or stupid during important points in the story. The characters all felt interesting and some scenes drew some strong emotions, overall a great movie and would recommend seeing it.",1
34,Finally after good/bad xmen movies or spinoffs we got the Wolverine we begged for aswell as a proper farewell to Hugh. Dafne Keen's acting is superbern for a character with barely any dialogue.,1
35,"The noir version in particular is a masterpiece, but any version of Logan is probably the most deeply personal and affecting superhero film ever made, and that's due in equal part to Jackman, Stewart, and Mangold.",1
36,I was really shocked when watched this in cinema. Dark & brutal superhero movie.,1
37,This will be one of my favorite movies of all time. Two of my favorite actors an incredibly human story for any movie but for a comic based movie this is unheard of. Everyone involved should be intensely proud.,1
38,"A farewell and a welcome!A perfect farewell to the only mutant who had solo films in 'X-Men' franchise. I never understood 'X-Men', I thought it was the worst superhero film series I've ever seen. But 'Wolverine' was the only reason I watched them all and particular, Hugh Jackman. There won't be Logan now onwards, though a set of new generation welcomed in this film, while saying goodbye to the old guys. So now what happens in the future of this franchise is a very suspense. Yet Logan had been the precious gem in the crown of 'X-Men', that mean it won't be the same anymore.After many years passed in the future, the last survivours of mutants hiding their identity and living among the humans. Logan and two others were attacked by the armed men when he decided to help a child mutant. Running away from them and looking for a place where they can be safe prioritised in the narration. More dramatised film in the franchise, but there are enough actions those who desire for that.It's an emotional time for the hardcore fans of Logan/Hugh Jachman. One final great performance by him and the little kid was also good. A well shot film, with minimum graphics and more realistic stunt sequences. Well, not all were real, too strong fights, too bloody, despite having a child actor in it. Yeah, it is a good film, I liked it, but not a masterpiece as you might have heard of. But anyway, it is a must see for the 'Wolverine' fans.7/10",1
39,"Logan is not only the quintessential Wolverine movie, it is one of the best superhero films full stop which is funny because one of the reasons this movie is so great is because it doesn't feel like a superhero film. Everything from the pacing, story, action and characters are top notch and Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen should be praised for their amazing performances. While the villains are not the best I have seen, especially when compared to Heath Ledgers Joker, they are still solid and the focus isn't really on them so their importance is limited compared to other villains. Finally, Logan delivers the perfect amount of R-rated violence, wth each fight scene having its fair share of blood and decapitations. This is the way it should be as Logan has always had grizzly, gritty and violent storylines and if anything was missing from previous installments, it was the lack of violence which Logan's character is known for. Overall, Logan represents the pinnacle of superhero movies. The story is gripping and emotional, the characters are believable as are their motivations and the action is gritty and violent. Everything comes together beautifully to create a satisfying conclusion and the perfect sendoff for this amazing character.",1
40,"An Emotional, Violent And Phenomenal Experience Unlike Any Other In The Genre, Logan's Outstanding Acting, Direction And Thrills Are Above And Beyond.",1
41,"Good movie if a little over the top. They pull the heart string card a few too many times though I have to admit that I will be sad if Patrick Stewart never returns as Professor X... He was the absolute most perfect actor for the role and it will be near impossible to get a replacement. Certainly the new guy playing the younger professor was lame by comparison. The other deaths were not as big of deal though I am a fan of Jackmans Wolverine. The problem is, I just dont find Wolverine interesting. Actually I think he is downright boring and idiotic. The only thing going for him is his drive to do right but in all other aspects he was always a doorknob, even in the comics. So him dying does not matter too much. The only other complaint I had is why they couldnt get a real Spanish speaker for the girl? She had the worst Spanish accent I have seen in many years. So bad, that even I was able to spot it and Spanish is my 3rd language. Cant be that hard to find a Mexican actress in California...Other than minor complaints, the movie was very enjoyable. Seeing these characters as old men was entertaining and watching Wolverine go up against his younger self was funny as well. I do enjoy watching bad guys get eviscerated and I like happy endings and this one had plenty of both. The villains were ok, certainly not as good as Magneto in the earlier films but adequate enough to glue the story together and keep me interested. Definitely see it if you have not.",1
42,"looks like all cucks are giving reviews to this one..anyway,someone bought this for me but i wish they didn't...i don't think children should be in movies first of all but thats a conversation for another time i guess..and i wish there could be some decent mutant powers throughout. its cool as hell that the professors brain cancer is causing him to kill people with headaches by accident but other than that I wouldn't care if this generic movie killed itsel",0
43,"Logan is powerful, real and truly exhilarating. It tells a perfectly small tale, but a big one thematically. The script, camera work, soundtrack and brilliant acting work to consolidate this as Marvel's strongest film to date.",1
44,"Hugh Jackman's swansong as the Wolverine in an X Men flick is good, not amazing, just good. Its very hard to critique without spoilers but let us say that it was a good enough movie to end on. It has it's flaws, very slow in the middle and the violence quota is really far too high, being two for example. But overall very satisfying in its realism and its moral narrative. I got a big Mad Max 2/3 vibe from this movie. Deserving of a 7 but only barely.",1
45,"Excellent, excellent movie. So much more mature and advanced than the previous entries in the X-Men franchise. Could have done with less F-bombs, but they are welcome nonetheless. The inclusion of Shane (classic Western, I think) was brilliant, and the scene where X-24 kills an entire family was heartbreaking to watch. Hugh Jackman's talent in that scene elevated it that much more. I haven't seen a film that is more No Country For Old Men in nature than this film since NCFOM itself. Maybe because I haven't seen a lot of movies, but whatever.",1
46,This is easily the best wolverine series movie and one of the best x men ever. Too bad this is the last one with Hugh Jackman. His performance in this one was also the best. For the fans this is must see.,1
47,"Logan is a one-of-a-kind film that honestly shouldn't be missed. Who would have thought that Shane meets Wolverine meets Unforgiven would be such an incredible piece of art? This is an incredibly bloody, mature, R-Rated farewell to the old X-Men canon, and it could not have been done better. The script and performances are all Oscar-worthy. My one complaint is that the stylized camera work threw me off a little for such a realistic movie, but by the time the Logan was halfway over, I didn't mind so much. I will end this review by saying that a lot of people have called this one of the best super-hero films ever made, and it's hard to argue that.",1
48,"Very few to get ten (9-10/10)!Spoiler: clear the children thread (if they -the scientist, etc. - do not deal with them so much they will be mental disorderd, eg. can't drive, etc.) and a few more things... Very good movie.",1
49,"As one of the first big R-rated movies I've gone out and seen with a friend, I've gotta say that it was awesome. The action scenes themselves could be the whole movie and I would be just as happy. The story was an incredibly interesting take on the X-Men universe, though I will say that one might be a tad disappointed that it doesn't live up to the Old Man Logan comics that the movie is based off of. As a fan of Old Man Logan, I feel this, but not to an extent that I'm truly taken aback by it. It's a very respectful Wolverine movie that I can connect with, and a wonderful sendoff for Hugh Jackman's performance as the character.",1
50,Finally! A good Wolverine movie! With great intense action and a few heart-wrenching scenes it's a must see for both fan boys and regular movie goers.,1
51,What a great movie. I was not dissapointed. The trailer did not spoil the plot. Great performances by the leads. I have seen it two times and still surprised how good it is. Well directed movie.,1
52,"Well here is a film I loved, for so many reasons. The acting was spot on from Jackman, Stewart, Merchant, Holbrook and Keen. Each portraying there characters with true emotions and grit. It's no secret that the film had a huge legacy to keep on it's shoulders, mainly due to the other brilliant Xmen and origin stories that have been produced in the series by Marvel. Personally I feel the film did well to carry the legacy of its franchise, while still showing us the complex relationships between the characters, as well as the more real life relationships between us and people who are different. I hope that it highlight that story to other people who see the film. Moving back to the acting, I have to give a special mention to keen, as for me she stole the show, with her passionate yet fierce portrayal, it's clear in the film that she has been damaged, and she shows this incredibly well for such a young actress. I personally think she has places to go yet.Moving to the set and scenery it was produced well, the use of CGI wasn't so blatantly obvious in the background scenery as in other films. Generally its holds up as a great action/science-fiction film, I personally recommend going to see it as quickly as you can.",1
53,"One of the best marvel movies ever made, bloody, emotional, good plot, and very good acting and action sequences, some parts could do little better same with the villains like Donald Pierce, which I was expecting to fight against Logan, but I still love it, and never seen a little girl doing so great on an R film, and even if Logan is already old and dying by the poison of his adamntium, he still a badass, although the end was sad with Logan's death, but it was fair enough because he finally rest after all the hard life he went through, and to say goodbye to Hugh Jackman after the great performance he did with wolverine, and same to Patrick Stewart, and I really feel sad to see them both go away after all this years with the x-men movies, never will be another actors that can take their places as they did, thanks to fox too, because if it was part of Disney, we would never see the bloody and real side of wolverine... btw I was about to give it 9/10 but I think it well deserve a 10/10.",1
54,"A movie with surprising depth and profundity that was able to make basic human emotions matter as much if not more than super powers. For example, we find Charles Xavier, a brilliant man who's powers were reliant on his brain, coping with such an ironic and tragic but human situation: his mind is betraying him. When he realizes his crime committed to those he had spent so long nurturing and acting as a father figure to, especially as a senile old man, that truly was heartbreaking. Logan still has his hard-earned pessimism but you really get a feel of how exhausted of life he is. My one gripe were the villains were kind of bland for me, though they do serve their purpose  as vehicles for ideologies. I do have a higher expectation from Xmen to have villains be more than just bad guys in costume up to no good, and while that wasn't exactly the case here I did find their depth more on the lacking side.In all, I felt the movie really did a great job focusing on characters and relationships and showed how the Xmen were not a superteam, but a surrogate family.",1
55,"Hugh Jackman kills it as Logan, really shows where Logan is at this point. Patrick Stewart brilliant in showing X's mental deterioration. This film is heart wrenching and thrilling. It was a bit slow for me in terms of meeting Laura to escaping with here, but otherwise an excellent film.",1
56,"The best acting of Hugh Jackman and the always fantastic Patrick Stewart. The film shows the part of humanity of Wolvering, over time and old age. I think the movie has the most realistic ending to the most famous hero of X-Men. In my opinion a Great Movie.",1
57,"Amazing way to end the story behind the X-Men we know. Amazing actors and great representation they had. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart were really impressive in this movie. I loved the 'relationship' Logan and Laura had and the rage among them was perfect. Some little details made me not give it a 10 but this movie has everything i love to watch. Great story, great action, great drama and the emotional aspects were on point.",1
58,"An atmospheric Superhero Western with a strong set of central performances (including a very surprising performance from child actor Dafne Keene). The film is gory and gritty, but never laboriously so and the script keep things moving at a very healthy pace.",1
59,"Saying that this movie is my favorite superhero movie ever made (so far) might be overhyping it for some people, but it's true. This is a gory, tense, emotional, ultraviolent comic movie that deserves all the praise.",1
60,"You've probably heard this more than once before, that this movie is not a superhero movie but a great movie in general. It is true. I was always a fan of the X-men franchise, but as good as The Last Stand or Days of Future Past gets, I would be very hesitant tp recommend them to people who don't give a crap about the franchise, because for them, watching those movies without some interest for the franchise is like going to a rap concert not knowing any of the songs. However, there are always a few outstanding superhero movies that can be a fascinating movie on its own. In 2004 there was the incredibles; in 2008 there was The Dark Knight. Fortunately enough, we have another one of those in 2017, and it's Logan. Logan is the rare type of superhero movie that I would dare recommend to my lab research instructor without him thinking I'm a naive kid who still watches Marvel. It is an incredible journey of Wolverine's final struggle of nature and artificiality, and BOY IS IT WORTH WATCHING!",1
61,"This movie is truly beautiful. Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart pulled off their best performances as these characters. The new addition of Dafne Keene was perfect, and I can't wait to see her spinoff movie. Director James Mangold nailed the dark, foreboding atmosphere without making it feel schlocky or edgy. The writing is also some of the best in any superhero or comic book movie ever, with each story beat landing perfectly and tearing at all of our collective heartstrings. The deaths of Charles Xavier is one of the darkest and most powerful pieces of cinema to date. And of course, I must talk about the death of Logan. It is a showing of perfect cinema, with him finally succumbing to death after years of being unable to die. Of course, the action is also spectacular, with the R rating really giving us the full affect. Both of the fights with X-24 are standouts, the sheer level of brutality making the audience squirm. I saw this movie in theaters, and at the end of the movie, nobody was talking or theorizing, the only sounds were people crying, myself included. Overall, this movie is my personal favorite of all time, and I fail to truly see any of the problems that plague the superhero genre.",1
62,"(93/100)This is the perfect send-off and ending for Hugh Jackman as Logan. It was heartbreaking, full of action and a fitting conclusion to Logan's story.",1
63,"Note:9.4Logan shows us that superhero movies can also be targeted only at adults, an absurd violence that greatly benefits the film, a very powerful and deep script that sometimes makes you feel like the character, you feel the deaths as if it were very close of them, feels the joys and sorrows too, the film stays firm and strong in the three acts. Logan is a great movie, more that you are half down when you finish watching and that is a positive point. A beautiful farewell to Hugh Jackman in the skin of Wolverine",1
64,"Before seeing Logan I was very exciting. But nothing could prepare me for how excellent the movie would end up being. It is truly the best X-Men movie yet, and perhaps the best superhero movie period. The script is great, the acting is great, the action is great, it goes on and on. The movie manages to humanize the cast, and build a truly emotional story that still maintains a sense of hope.Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart completely own their roles, and Dafne Keen manages to hold her own despite being a child actress at the age of 12, with all three having incredible chemistry together.And yes, this movie is R. It is super violent. But it is violent in a way that enhances rather than dominates, feeling gritty and grounded, unlike Deadpool which used over the top violence for dark comedy.In the end, Logan is a masterpiece, and a perfect sendoff for both Hugh Jackman and the Wolverine character. It deserves to be the first superhero film to be nominated for best picture.",1
65,"Certainly the best in the series and one of the best X-Men universe movies I've seen in a while. Its well directed, incredibly well acted and feels more personal and human than ""Origins"" and ""the Wolverine."" All in all, its a ftting way to say goodbye to Logan and Hugh Jackman, whom I'll truly miss seeing as Wolverine.",1
66,"With the exception of Guardians of the Galaxy, this is the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight. It's a swan song with a depressing world that reflects on its few glimmers of hope scattered throughout a fantastic 2 hours and 20 minute run time. The only superhero movie to actually move me. I already want to see it again.",1
67,"James Mangold doesn't hold back with Logan, with Hugh Jackman playing a more realistic Wolverine in a more adult movie. A gripping story with a sad but beautiful ending. It really separates itself from the usual superhero dross and it is possibly the best superhero film I have ever seen.",1
68,"Logan marks what may be the final outing for Hugh Jackman as the character Wolverine as well as Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. Jackman and Stewart give stellar performances that make you believe that these are men on the ropes. You can feel the emotion and baggage each of them bear. The media has questioned whether superhero fatigue is setting in. What Logan does so well is that while it does depict characters that have super powers/abilities; it focuses on the human elements. What it's like to become older. Having responsibility for someone else thrust upon you. Wolverine's relationship with Laura (X-23) in particular is interesting to see develop over the course of the film. The film does kind of get bogged down in the 2nd act when they essentially find themselves on a road trip. But I was so invested in these characters by that point, that I was eager to see what happened next. The film is rated R and for good reason. If Deadpool is one end of the spectrum, Logan is on the other. The violence isn't comedic as it was in Deadpool. It accentuates and amplifies just how brutal Wolverine and his young ward can be. Logan is a great film that adds one more feather to Fox's cap after the success of Deadpool. It is my hope that Fox takes the right lessons from these two films in that with the right talent, direction, writing and respect of the source material, comic book films can be incredibly poignant.",1
69,"If I could give this an 11/10, I would. This is up there with my favorite films of all time, on the same level as Good Will Hunting. This is emotional, action-packed fun, with a great script and incredible acting from Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and newcomer Dafne Keen. There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about this film. It tugs at the heartstrings, while having funny moments along the way, and great chemistry between all the main characters.",1
70,"Easily the best Wolverine movie made.  The feel is gritty and extremely violent, the Wolverine we've all wanted to see.  It's a tad long, but James Mangold had his finger on this character and the finished product is great.  A",1
71,"A welcome addition to an already saturated genre, continuing a movie series that everyone thought was all but exhausted of any chance of a sequel being good and remarkably creative. Logan achieves what all other Wolverine-Centric X-Men films all failed to do: make you actually care about what the heck is going on in this ultra violent, ultra science fiction world. Gone are the extremely convoluted, over-ambitious science-based plot points and bloated cast of mutants. Instead, everything is focused on exactly what is most important to this story: Wolverine, Xavier, Laura. All the fat of quicksilver and blah, and who else can we squeeze into this terrible story to make an extra buck--it's all been cut out. This is a mature film; it goes down like a sip of properly aged whisky: bold, sophisticated, and not for the faint of heart. The only real complaint I have is that the ultimately bloody end of this film felt abrupt after watching the film once; I was expecting an additional 5-20 minutes to completely solidify the end of the most favorite X-Men character's arc. Instead, we get a fairly quick last moments of Wolverine with his daughter, the two finally using the familial terms they never had the privilege to use, and then he's buried. That's it. Maybe it's because the movie was so good that I wanted more? Eh, I'll just buy it when it gets released from home entertainment. Even if you were as skeptical as I was about this movie, go see it. It will impress you.",1
72,"La mejor película de Wolverine en todas sus apariciones, un héroe cansado y enfermo, cargando cruces y culpas que no son de él. La película es ultra violenta y sus enemigos no son épicos, no hay extraterrestres, ni dioses, no hay naciones en peligro, esta película es el testamento de un héroe que aunque prefiere que lo dejen tranquilo no es capaz de ser indiferente a las tragedias de otros. Junto al Batman de Nolan es la mejor película de un superhéroe que he visto (las otras son corales). Una película perfecta para cerrar el ciclo de Hugh Jackman. Grandes actores y lo único que hizo falta fue la canción Hurt interpretada por Johny Cash al final de la proyección.",1
73,"Is it possible to have a real tribute to a great character, while making a thought provoking movie in the process? If it is, Logan achieved it. This movie is a heartfelt tribute to Wolverine. It explores the deepest fears - Professor , after so many years helping people, is losing control and destroying or harming those around him. Logan, after years as a near invincible fighting machine, is slowly falling apart physically. The movie, while having some of the best Wolverine moments in Cinema, pays the ultimate price for every ounce of strength. Overall, a great art film, and worth watching whether you like Marvel or not.",1
74,"If you are a fan you will cry a lot... If you are not you will cry a little bit less but both will love it... Intense, gore, action, drama, fan service... Espetacular",1
75,"""Logan"". Hugh Jackman's final portrayal as The Wolverine. This is The Wolverine movie that we need. James Mangold successfully redeem himself and proves that he can make a fantastic Wolverine solo movie. It has so many great moments and actions. The bloodiest, most brutal and gut-wrenching superhero movie I've ever seen. Deadpool is the bloodiest? No.Alright, let's review it. This movie is different. Unlike any other superhero movies that filled with a lot of CGI, Logan entertain us with its story, depth and realistic violence. The pacing is sometimes draggy, but it's not a big deal. I still enjoy it. From the acting division, I won't talk much about Jackman's performance, he is the Wolverine. Patrick Stewart does a great job with his sad, in agony but doesn't-lose-faith character. Holbrook successfully brings the villainous charisma with his intimidating and a lil' bit annoying (in a good way) act. Dafne Keen, wow, just wow. The cinematography is also great. A lot of rural's view and action sequences perfectly captured. The camera movements fits perfectly with this movie's tone. Jackman ends his Wolverine saga with a fantastic bang.",1
76,"Filme espetacular. A trama do filme está perfeita, Hugo Jacman faz um papel incrivel mais uma vez e todo o conjunto de personagens está top. O final é muito muito bom e está nos meus filmes preferidos de Heróis.",1
77,"Took long enough but we’ve finally been gifted with a truly super Wolverine movie. It’s violent, dark, and bleak but more importantly for the first time it gives an honest depiction of the character and not a censored, watered down version. So do yourself a favour and just erase the other Wolverine movies from your mind and replace it with this fantastic movie.Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen are wonderful. With Jackman’s last portrayal of the character there was no better way to do it. The best X-Men movie since X-Men 2 and one of the best superhero movies in a long time. It gripped me from the moment it started and I loved every minute of it. I could rant and rave about how great Logan is all day and if you don’t believe me well then you’ll just have stop reading this, get to a cinema and watch it for yourself. Without a doubt the highest recommendation I can possibly give.",1
78,"Well, it's not really a spoiler if we all know Logan's gonna be dead by the end of the movie, huh? But that's not really the only spoiler. Prof. X is dead too. And hell, this is one depressing superhero movie. A disabled 90-something man with brain disease being kept in a huge tank by another old, ailing man on Mexico-US border, with both being chased by the government. And to make it even more depressing, Logan dies holding his heart in his hand (That 2013's The Wolverine prophecy). If Deadpool brought something new to the genre with tons of swearing, blood, violence, and nudity, Logan is one of those superhero film you can call ""dark"" and ""adult-only"". It's full of amazing actions, drama, and acting. Both Jackman and Stewart deserve an Oscar nod (But unfortunately, I don't see it happening). In my opinion, this is the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight. And that says a lot, considering my unconditional love for MCU movie.Really, a fitting final goodbye to Jackman's Logan. After 17 years and 9 movies, they should retire Wolverine for good. 17 years as a single superhero character is unprecedented.",1
79,"Whoa! Where has this wolverine been all my life?! When first hearing ""another"" wolverine was getting made, to be honest, I was just hoping for a dud so that way they could just start fresh and get a whole new wolverine going, but boy was I wrong. The fact that they didn't even need to follow the comic and it stands on its own as a classic and a total original is why I can't recommend this movie enough.",1
80,"This is by far the best Fox X-Verse movie to date. The film is so brutal yet so heart felt and emotional at the same time. It knows what it is,its not your typical Super Hero movie where the hero saves the day no, its about a broken man who really has nothing to live for anymore. Hugh Jackman really gave it his all in his final performance as the Wolverine so did Sir Patrick Stewart, Daphny Keen (Sorry bout your name) did a mind blowing performance as X-23 and i definitely see her in future X-Men films. This movie will break you down emotionally, James Mangold direction is so spot on, it knows where to hit you emotionally. Put the MCU-DCEU rivalry aside, Fox just came out with an amazing film that in my opinion is on Par with The Dark Knight.",1
81,"A film like Logan could not have been directed by X-Men longtime director Bryan Singer. It took James Mangold to create a rich, tonally different, yet consistent movie like this. Mangold's writing/directing always seems to be one step ahead of the audience, and Jackman's performance as the titular hero is grotesque, in the best way. In fact, this is one of his best performances, as well as every other actor.",1
82,"A perfect goodbye for The Wolverine.I went to the theater and I had high expectations. I didn't watch any trailers because I wanted to go 'clean' into the theater. This is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen, easily as good as the Dark Knight. The mature way of telling a story about an old and damaged Logan. The road Logan, Charles and Laura is simply amazing. It has exactly the right amount humor. And the R-rating is exactly what I was hoping for. This movie is a masterpiece and a movie every fan of action, superheroes or simply beautiful movies should see.",1
83,"Logan é um filme denso, intrigante, cheio de ação e principalmente de tirar algumas lágrimas. Não é um filme com cara 'marvel' digamos assim. A relação de Charles com Logan foi tão bem construída que eu acho que Patrick merecia um oscar como melhor ator coadjuvante. A interpretação dele e a construção do personagem na história é de emocionar qualquer um. Por outro lado, temos a desconstrução do personagem Logan, onde vemos claramente suas mudanças tanto físicas e emocionais. Dafne Keen que interpretou a X-23 impressionou com sua atuação impecável. Com apenas 12 anos ela se mostrou uma atriz com um grande potencial, principalmente nas cenas de ação. O filme inteiro é recheado de cenas de ação, com um roteiro fechado e uma descrição completa de cada personagem. A direção de arte desse filme é mais escura, mais pesada, pois não é uma história para te entreter, é uma história para te emocionar. Conseguimos desenvolver afeto com os personagens, se emocionar com a trilha sonora e ainda por cima dar umas boas risadas, ou seja, é um filme completo. Claro que, eu poderia citar algumas coisas que eu não curti no filme, mas são tão insignificantes que nem vem ao caso discutir. Hugh Jackman nos apresentou um personagem com emoções e mais abalado. Enfim, é um filme que não é só sobre ação e violência, mas também sobre família. Foi lindo a forma como retrataram a relação familiar de Logan neste filme.",1
84,"This movie is pretty unrelenting in its bleakness and horror, but it bring to light a new side of Wolverine and the struggles of a long life. The action scenes are superb and it certainly earns its R rating right from the get go. I think First Class may be my favorite of the X-Men film, in part because it felt like something new and changed the game for the franchise. Logan feels less like a game-changer and more like a game-ender and is the perfect sendoff for Jackman and Stewart. I can't imagine how X-men will follow this up, but I'm eager to see if they can build on the breath of fresh air this gave them.",1
85,"Logan is clearly part of my top 5 movies. Hugh Jackman's performance is perfect with Patrick Steward and the incredibly talented Dafne Keen. The story is really deeper than ever in the X-Men movies universe. The choices made in this film touched me; they took some risks and in my opinion, they did well. Enough words, just go see it right now. Already did? Watch it just once again. You'll never regret it.",1
86,"The film itself contains an essence of something I had seen before, just look at the relationship between the old and decadent Logan and the little Laura, the family concept is constituted by the few culminated in moments full of frantic action, shocking violence and a Sad end Logan surprises in everything, distancing himself from everything that was his predecessors and closing with mastery the saga of Old Wolverine.",1
87,"Absolutely amazing performance by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Dafne Keen. Don't watch Logan expecting it to be a bread and butter superhero flick like Avengers or Iron Man.  It is so much more.   Logan has a very real and gritty feel that makes it truly a special and emotional journey.Logan is not a cliché tale of a group of heroes fighting a villain to stop the end of the world, but rather a journey of self-discovery and new meaning for James Howlett.Logan is an absolute masterpiece and I would be surprised if it's not one of my top movies of 2017 come December.",1
91,"This movie is just spectacular! For me, x-men movies always had something special in them. They have a ""soul"" and invoke serious topics that not every movie dares to mention. Considering this, Logan is quintessential of these series! It has everything that great movie should have and even more. I really want to see more of Logan but I hope they will not continue his story because this is the best finale possible for this character!",1
92,"I was going with good expecting for this movie and left the theater with a good mood. ""Logan"" is a cool movie with down to earth vibe that is not typical for superhero movies and I AM FREAKING LOVED IT. As a guy how tired from silly and over hyped comic book flicks I found this one more seriously and far more enjoyable than than latest DC or Marvel movies. It is awesome that they used Rating R for Wolverine movie(finally) because everything is looking real and does not feel like they constrained from some scenes. This rating is giving so much freedom and art is freedom so please use more of that in other movies where rating R is much needed. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and little girl Dafne Keen are fabulous. I was impressed the most with Dafne for sure by cause of it is hard to see kid character that is playing this good and doesn't make you cringe. So good overall. Only downside for me is that third act of the movie feels a little rushed and does not have high intense moments. I would love to see Hugh Jackman again as wolverine. I have no idea who can play that character rather than him. God damn....17 years of playing same guy...",1
93,"Its takes a special kind of movie to leave you with the chills, happiness, sadness etc. But never has a movie has me feel numb, with such raw emotion, real character development and a fitting send off for the wolverine, Logan is more so an experience then a film.What is first notable about logan is the obvious deviation from the superhero genre itself similar in the vein of films such as unbreakable, the dark knight and watchman yet different in the way that it begs the question, what if the superman was still among us and didn't care anymore? A question which director James Mangold and actors Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen answer so well words cannot describe. What is incredibly unique about logan however is how well paced the movie feels with even the slow parts of the film being extremely entertaining and satisfying in the way that the story develops a memorable arc with many beautifully shot sequences. Logan also lives up to its rating aswell with a tone of severed limbs and blood fountains that pump a large amount of adrelune into the film while not deviating into the stupidly goory side of things.Overall Logan is an experience and has to be seen and not spoiled to recieve the full measure of the films greatness.",1
94,"Delicate moments bring out the cringe in the gore, and when the gore's flying it makes you scared for future delicate moments. This movie is beautifully acted, shot, etc. Slow scenes only slightly damper it down because the characters are so enduring that you don't mind just hearing them talk.",1
95,"What better way to say ""goodbye"" to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine than to adapt Mark Millar's ""Old Man Logan"" comic book into an R-Rated and poignant picture. 'Logan', directed by James Mangold ('Walk the Line' and 'The Wolverine') takes place in the year 2029, and we see an aged Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), beaten and weak from his adamantium poisoning, trying to take care of the usual business. He is spending his days as a chauffeur and smuggling prescription drugs in Texas, the drugs are for a senile Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart, who actually appears old for once), who apparently is responsible for the death of the X-Men due to a seizure attack one year before. Logan seems to be followed by a woman named Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) who informs Logan to take care of a young girl and get her to where she needs to go. This young girl however, is no ordinary child, she seems to inhabit mutant powers as well, similar to that of Logan. She has blades that can extend from her knuckles. Logan and Charles try to protect her from a man named Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), the leader of the Reavers, who want to take the little girl named ""Laura"" for some experiment. The movie then becomes a road-trip of sorts, where we spend most of the time with these characters trying to get away from the bad guys. 'Logan' is a fantastic movie, what makes it even better is that it's not your typical superhero movie where men are wearing colorful spandex, fly around, and try to battle some CGI army in a city where innocent people run away from the danger. This is a Western, and it doesn't feel like an adaptation where pages from the comic book are ripped out and brought to the big screen. Director James Mangold improves heavily from his last movie 'The Wolverine' (2013) which I enjoyed very much, until the third act, but it was still a solid movie. He was right to change up the genre, he was right to use ""Old Man Logan"" as an inspiration for Hugh Jackman's last ever appearance as Wolverine. Even just the title 'Logan' sounds much like a Western movie. This movie also thrives on the R-Rating... in fact, the very first word spoken is the ""F"" word, and is said by our title character. The violence here, while very bloody and graphic, feels natural. Much like 'Deadpool' (2016) before it, the violence, the profanity... they don't feel forced just to get that ""R"" rating, unlike the movie 'Sausage Party' (2016) which I mildly enjoyed, that movie was trying way too hard to be crude and vulgar at every minute to achieve its restricted rating. With 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'Logan', none of it is overused, but when a violent incident occurs... prepare yourself because this movie does not hold back on its promise to be rated 'R'. There is no better way to end Hugh Jackman's run as Wolverine, Mangold handles it fantastically well. Jackman gives this movie one last shot, and he does it with such grace, Stewart has also never been better, but at the same time, it's interesting to see him in this state. Dafnee Keen, who plays the little girl Laura, is also fantastic as the angry and curious child of her own powers. 'Logan' is already one of the best movies in the ""X-Men"" franchise.",1
96,"Who: Hugh Jackman, Jean Luc Picard, and the most talented child actor of all time as X-23What: The incredibly moving most grown up superhero movie ever createdWhere: The part of the X-Men universe that is loosely based on a Clint Eastwood filmWhen (can I watch again): As soon as you recover from the emotional tole this movie takes on youWhy: If X-Men DoFP was our childhood's redemption, this movie is our childhood's funeral. Strap yourself in for one final yet perfect adventure.",1
97,"The best X-men movie I have seen. It is gritty, dark, violent, but with some humor (Professor X dropping F-Bombs :) ) and few touching scenes. Action was perfect.Story was very good, but I removed 1 point for too many mysteries. I don't know the background of what I am watching. What happened with all the X-men? What happened with the world (or precisely USA in the movie? Is this movie continuation of first or second X-men universe? Maybe those questiones are answered in some of the books, but for someone like me, who read x-men comics 20 years ago, it is just a bit chaotic.",1
98,"Brilliant story. This different take on the beloved X-Men character is nothing short of gasps, tears, laughter and major goosebumps! A must see for not only superhero fans but movie lovers.",1
99,"Man OH man this one was one hell of a movie. It was incredible and emotional. Logan was a perfect goodbye to Wolverine and Charles Xavier. The action scenes were so amazing that I actually smiled every time when Wolverine started slicing people and the way they made the movie R rated was a VERY good decision. The child that played X-23 did a really great job playing the role. I know in the comics that she's much older than nine but I'm going to let this one pass. The ending was really sad but I won't spoil it for ya. Overall, this was the best entry in the X-men series and undeniably the best Wolverine movie ever! Thank you Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart for your awesome involvement in the X-men franchise for 17 years. We will miss you!",1
100,"Logan is an intense and emotionally driven drama film that often times makes me forget that its still a superhero movie. Its a fantastic film period. I've never really been into the X-Men universe but Logan caught my eye as it focuses more on emotion, character development, and relationships rather than on CGI action and over the top spectacle. The film tells a brutally realistic story about an old beaten Wolverine who wants to move on in life but gets pulled back into a problem. But this problem is very personal to Logan, making for the characters to really shine and resonate with you long after seeing the movie. I loved all the performances; from of course Logan, to Professor X, to the little girl, to the villain, etc. The direction and writing were excellent, the cinematography was fantastic, and the gore and practical filming locations really added to the realism and tone of the story. Whether you are a fan of superhero movies or just great films, this is a must see.",1
101,"Logan might be cursed to be known as a comic book movie. Strip that down, this an incredible Sci Fi adventure movie. Like the best examples in this genre, the story revolves around human emotions and conditions, things that are seldom explored in CB movies, specially at this level. Logan is right next to Nolan's Dark Knight of pictures that transcend the genre. Notice that the expected Violence (this is VERY R-Rated) feels also real and natural and although graphic, it never happens without purpose and justification.This movie was so gratifying. In a world populated by Marvel and DC movies, this one could be a game changer in more ways than expected",1
102,"Logan is something new, maybe the line that cuts the new and old superheroes movies, makes you feel near the character. A good story, great actors, drama, comedy and action. It's all about this, widely recommended. The La La Land of superheroes.",1
103,"To be Honest when i left the cinema I was so excited for what I have whatched, finally a REAL WOLVERINE movie, the R is a must here, with a very dramatic scenes and EXTRAORDINARY SCENES OF ACTION.This movie is not for everybody, becouse it takes long time to explain what is happening and how the characters are developed. The ""trinity"" in this movie is EXCELENTE (Logan, Charles, Laura).The whole movie is a tribute to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.In conclusion, if you love road trips movies, JUST WATCH IT, if you love Wolverine, JUST watch it.",1
104,"Logan is a masterpiece! One of the best movies ever created, period. Hugh Jackman will always be the Wolverine and his claws will be hard to be worn by anyone else. Although Laura was brilliant and proved that she can be the next generation wolveine.",1
105,"Logan is a fantastic movie that has great performances from Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Dafne Keen. It gives fans the Wolverine movie they have wanted for years, while non-comic book fans will also enjoy it because of its relevant and mature themes.",1
106,"Hugh Jackman says this will be his final film as Wolverine. He's working as a chauffeur (driving a beautiful Chrysler limo) attempting to stay unnoticed in a near future world where most mutants have died out. When a young girl with special powers shows up, he's forced into take her on the run. This is a more intimate take on the superhero genre. Yes, there are several great claw-slashing scenes, but there's also a more personal drama and less flashy special effects. Writer/director James Mangold has given the film a bleak personal perspective and managed some nice twists to keep it interesting. While not breaking any new ground for cool visuals, it does break the mold with a more dramatically compelling (yet still action fused) take on the genre. NOTE: Don't be late. There's a funny new promo for DEADPOOL 2 right before the film.",1
107,As Deadpool majors in comedy. Logan introduces drama and emotion into the superhero genre. The movie does not hold back on action but peels that away for some heart-touching moments with two of the most loved X-Men.,1
109,"Just seen it, and hard to know what to think. It was freakin epic, tough as nails, badass movie, a proper Wolverine movie if there ever was one. It made use of its somewhat slower, character study pace fantastically, and if this is the end, it was a hell of a sendoff to one of the best fictional characters ever created.What left me very confused though...is that this was the actual end. Logan is immortal, he can not die. Yes, I am the last person to demand that film sticks to source material, and yes I fully appreciate the ""connected but also stand alone"" nature of these films, but still. Beside his claws, the one known, certain thing about Logan is that he can not be killed. And the fact that they didn't really explain what killed him did not sit well with me. Some unnamed sickness and a stick through his stomach. It just seems that if they were going to do the seeming impossible...there should have been a clear reason for it provided.The cross-into-X moment at the end, and the faith religious references were a welcomed sight though. Logan has struggled with religious questions far more than the movie ever depicted, so at least a hint of that was appreciated. The movie definitely moved me a lot, and there's no doubt that overall it was a great send off. But the question of how exactly he died is not sitting too well with me right now.",1
110,"Logan is a marquee movie of the superhero genre. A nearly flawless film and a fantastic sendoff for Jackman. The first action sequence with Laura (X-23) is a perfect introduction to the well deserved R-rating film. As much blood and gore as a Tarantino film, decapitated heads, gratuitous stabbing, and bloody slashes, clawed uppercuts to skulls. This movie while accompanied by much action and blood but it is a strong character development film. Charles Xavier is a great senile old man and a great father figure. Logan is stubborn about refusing a happy family and that remains consistent until the very end.Pacing, action, characters, all is great. Without prior knowledge of X-Men or Wolverine it still stands as a strong action & sci-fi movie.",1
111,"Perfect end for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Usually superhero movies are actions driven with story thrown in there for a good mix; this was story driven movie with necessity for action. And yes, the action was awesome. Well timed. Graphics look great. I am really happy they did R rated instead of going to PG13 which doesnt do wolverine justice.",1
112,"First thing's first. It may be by my own doing, but my extremely high expectations for this film going in led to a bit of disappointment in some areas. Don't get me wrong, this was easily the best solo Wolverine outing. However, in my opinion, it's far from being the best X-Men film overall (personally, I enjoyed Days of Future Past and Deadpool the most.) Some have even gone as far as to say that this is Marvel's ""The Dark Knight"", and that it's just as good, if not, better than that film. I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say that either unfortunately. Anyway, with all of that out of the way, this was still a solid and entertaining final outing for Wolverine with all of the grittiness and hard violence that the fans had asked for over and over again for the longest time, not unlike last year's ""Deadpool"" as well (btw, he does have his own humorous little intro at the very beginning of the film.) Hugh Jackman is better than ever, with his portrayal of Wolverine feeling more humanistic and vulnerable than before. Like I said before, the action is top-notch and the violence and blood ever so present like what we had hoped for all this time in a Wolverine film. The film did an excellent job of really getting things interesting and going in the first half with the story and action. However, it's the second half where my disappointment began to settle in, as the story, as well as the final 20-30 minutes in particular began to feel rushed and the ending also felt pretty underwhelming and rushed for me overall. It definitely left me feeling that our silver-clawed friend deserved a much bigger sendoff rather than the underwhelming and rushed one that was given instead. Overall, this was still the best Wolverine film by far, but unfortunately, it didn't quite fully live up to the hype for me and I didn't find myself loving it like I had so hoped. Nevertheless, it's still a very entertaining and action-packed addition to the X-men franchise, and one that allowed Hugh Jackman to give us a well-meaning and powerful final performance in his career-making role.",1
113,"Wow! What a ride...Before I start my review I'd like to thank to everyone who contributed to making this masterpiece.This has been the best movie I've seen in many years. It was an emotional rollercoaster. You laugh, you cry, you get excited when you see those claws used in a proper manner. The movie is Rated R, thus it's bloody gore. You finally get to see what Wolverine is meant to be... a brutal animal.All the actors performed beautifully in this movie. The sound the effects the scenario which leaves only minor gaps when it ends are all beautiful. The cinematography is great. The atmosphere of despair is even better than the opening of X-Men Days of the Future Past. I wont say anything but if you are an X-Men fan like me, go out and see this movie. This movie deserves all the attention it can get.Really sad to see Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart leaving their mantles with this last movie. Thank you for all the good feelings and thank you for making my childhood better.So this is what it feels like... to be old.",1
114,"A moderately entertaining action-adventure offering that's a stand-alone story from the ""X-men"" franchise. While a bit more gratuitous than I typically care for, and with an overlong middle section that could have benefited from some considerable chopping, the film nevertheless delivers a compelling story with good action sequences, ample humor and familiar characters seen in an unfamiliar light. Fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy this the most, but even casual movie goers are likely to find a fair amount of entertainment value here.",1
115,"Simply put, bravo ! Mangold gave Wolverine the picture this character deserves. I've always felt that all the other movies including him had their foot on the brakes but not this time. The balance between the emotional state of each characters (he's not mentioned enough but Merchant is also spot on), the violence of the images, and the rythm of the movie is almost perfect. They could have asked Ennio Morricone to score the soundtrack even !",1
116,"""Logan"" is the best movie to wear the Marvel brand. However, i thought the third act with the evil Wolverine clone as well as Boyd Holbrooks characters anti-climatic death was dumb. Despite that, the final performances of Hugh Jackman as the titular character and Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier are perfect in this movie. The 'R' rating is also something i am extremely happy to get more of in bigger movies.",1
117,"Logan is just a brilliant movie. It shows the progression of superhero genre as a whole. It dares to explore a side of the characters which only a few movies would display, along with the underlying emotions which embody them.",1
118,"I would rather a movie be flawed while trying to achieve greatness, than be generic. Logan is a fantastic ride. Things I loved - 1. The kid. Great stuff from her2. The atmosphere. Chilling stuff3. Logan himself4. The sendoffThings I had a problem with - 1. The ending felt abrupt and incomplete. (I get it. This is Logan's story, and it end on his grave. But when talking about the narrative of the story, they left a gaping hole in the end. It is like playing a video game till the end and finding out the ending will be part of the next installment)2. Professor X's death. This was to be a big moment. Could (should) have milked it better. (I do like that his death came after he had the best night he had in a long time)3. The vagueness. I don't know if I missed something (maybe I did) but I feel like not all about this whacky universe was explained. (I did not see x-men apocalypses; so maybe that's why).But all in all, the movie was still  GREAT and I would definitely put it among the top superhero movies ever.",1
119,"Мои завышенные ожидания не оправдались и я даже немного разочарован.Рейтинг R пошёл на ползу, фильм выглядит взрослым не только из-за жестокости, но и из-за атмосферы, диалогов. К концу фильма диалогов становится всё больше и меня они утомили, они интересные, но порой слишком затянутые. Экшен сделан на твёрдую 5, теперь словно чувствуешь когти росомахи, кровь летит во все стороны вместе с руками и ногами.Итог: Отличное кино, где всё аспекты выполнены очень грамотно, но в целом, я бы не сказал ""вау"".",1
120,"Logan is the Wolverine film I have wanted for so long now. Not so many superhero films can walk the gritty line and be successful but Logan does with style, action and emotion. It's a visceral, well paced and well directed piece, with stellar performances all round particularly from Hugh with his portrayal of a dying wolverine and likewise with Sir Patrick.Overall this easily becomes one of my favourite superhero movies, it is a very good film.",1
121,"Logan is refreshingly human and small-scale for a ""superhero"" film. There's no portals in the sky waiting to annihilate a planet, just a grizzled man and a young girl on the run. It's a poignant conclusion to Hugh Jackman's 17-year run playing the Wolverine, as he goes out giving his best performance as the character to date.",1
122,"Perhaps the best installment of this 17 year running franchise. This film is flat out great and a game changer in the comic book movie genre. Having the feel of a small budget indie film and class western, Logan earns it's R rating with its brutal violence that never feels forced. And if this is truly Hugh Jackman's final time as Logan, what a day to go out. Jackman delivers his best performance as Logan to date and straight up his best performance to date, worthy of Oscar consideration. Layered, emotionally powerful, Logan had me in tears by the end and it's something everyone should check out.",1
123,"Yes, this is the wolverine movie we were waiting for, it have violence, deep character progression and construction (or ""desconstruction"", in the Logan case) that make those people important and full of feelings, like almost every decision they make through their little journey.",1
124,The strongest and powerfull FOX - or XMEN - movie by far. It looks like they've learned the lesson since the Deadpool's blockbuster and it's the right way! The cinema experience is unique.,1
125,"a 10/10 personally from me, it was an amazing experience from the start to the end of this movie and especially Charles' and Logan's death they kept me sad for days even broke down twice. Everything for me was perfect from this movie, the best x-men movie to date especially since I grew up with x-men",1
126,"Gritty, unapologetic, Great unusual chemistry between the characters.A comic book story that you can sink your teeth into.a fitting swan song to a bad ass character",1
127,"All that I wanted to see. I loved the movie. Screenplay, Phonography, Performances. I think it should be the best movie (the second best) of the X-Men. I will miss this.",1
128,"Hugh Jackman in the role of a never seen Wolverine: tired and decadent, and with a certain pattern side. The sequences of violence are visceral but justified. Perchance one of best superhero movies of 2017.",1
129,"Last times are always perfect,and what Logan done as a goodbye to the X-Men is great,actually. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart did a great job in acting,the story was impressive and cool in the 1st and 2nd act,then there's the 3rd act,where the movie gets emotional (and you'll probably shed a tear,even if this is a comicbook movie). From the trailers it seemed weak,but the R-Rating in this movie was brutally great (maybe a bit more than Deadpool). This movie could not be Oscar-Worthy, but Marco Beltrami's score has a chance of being nominated,because that's some epic levels of emotion right there. In the end, best comicbook movie of the year? You can think again! Logan is not only that, but it's also the best X-Men movie since X2 and Days Of Future Past, with a dark and emotional plot, great levels of acting and an epic score that signs a farewell to the X-Men franchise.",1
130,"Exactly what I have been looking for in a comic book movie for years! I love how gritty they took this film and hope that they continue this direction with other comic book movies. That being said, it is a comic book movie, so don't expect the most original piece of film you have seen this year.",1
131,"Amazing movie, that in the end keeps it simple and cool all the way, the brutal violence the brown shade in the picture, its all fantastic, really a redemption for Hugh as Wolverine and in the end all you can think is that the hype was real and the tears you drop during the movie were worth it!",1
132,"And Hugh Jackman gets the sending off he deserves, they finally did justice to the wolverine character in this final solo act, it's bloody as it should, action is great and it's emotional when it needs to be... Can't help to think it could have been better with some more clever dialogue and some plot points that weren't really thought of, but overall, it was really great",1
133,"In a time when Marvel continues to churn out the same superhero film time-and-time again ('Deadpool' and 'Guardians' aside), it's refreshing when something as intricate and beautifully-executed as 'Logan' is made, and on the extremely rare occasion (the 'Dark Knight' trilogy being an exception) I have given a superhero film a solid 10. I mean let's face it, that first trailer was a dead giveaway of how damn good it was going to be.I understand that Marvel has made the attempt to build characters through a series of films previously, such as they have with the Avengers films, but never have I seen a film that treats character development as seriously, and pulls it off with such precision, as they did here in 'Logan', a film that focuses more on the ""humane"" aspect of the character and how vulnerable he is as a superhero, instead of the over-the-top execution that's usually featured ('X- Men Origins' I'm looking at you).Two characters that we've come to know and love, James ""Wolverine"" Howlett (aka Logan) and Charles ""Professor X"" Xavier, are put to the test of time as we see them in their new state, once characters that resembled strength and power, are now withering and vulnerable. And the gut-punching, adrenaline-pumping action has been swapped out for slow-moving, emotional drama and character development. Does it work? You bet! From start to finish we are led on a journey of discovery and empathy, with James Mangold more than making up for his previous effort that is ""The Wolverine"".With utterly stunning cinematography, a hard-hitting score, fantastic direction and a superhero performance that might just be the first Oscar-deserving one ever. Wolverine's outing makes for the best Marvel film to date!",1
134,"To be honest, I never seen that someone applauded in the movies, after this movie the whole cinema applauded, that was just excellent. In this movie there is more drama than in La La Land and Moonlight, great movie",1
135,"From beginning to end this is by far the greatest ""X-Men"" film yet. The way it started was providing a look at what Wolverine was living his life like today. With a detailed progression into what his life was going to be like soon; this Marvel hero marks his history in the comic book movie HOF. I would not recommend anyone under 18 (who is not approved for STRONG language or GORY blood scenes) to view this movie but is still a must see for all Marvel fans. I was a little disappointed there was no post-credit scene for the first time in my knowledge of Marvel films so don't waste your time waiting if you see it in theatre. I was also a little disappointed Stan Lee (writing creator of Marvel Comics) did not make his typical cameo appearance but even without him the movie still blew me away. For as story driven and action packed as this movie was I would also prepare you for an emotional roller coaster as well (not to get into detail for that would contain *spoilers*). Please go watch this movie for it deserves your audience. I am looking to improve my reviews for you so please be honest and let me know if my reviews are of any assistance.",1
136,"While the villains were as dull and expendable as any Marvel film, this one had more emotional depth and development than probably any you could name. Well, outside of Spiderman. Hopefully signaling that there might be a change to the Marvel formula. If not, at the very least, how FOX will handle the X-Men franchise going forward.",1
137,"Call it what you want (a western or a comic book movie), this first and foremost is a brilliant character study. For die hard fans and casual movie-goers alike, this is the Wolverine movie every one has been waiting for. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are outstanding and Dafne Keen is a star in the making. It's one of the best in it's genre and it's up there with 'The Dark Knight' and 'Spider-Man 2' for me. 8/10",1
138,"Fantastic movie, way way darker than I thought it would be (in a good way).  Jackman and Stewart both put in great performances, and added a lot of depth to previously fairly one dimensional characters.",1
139,"Took many crap x-men/wolverine movies before we got a winner. Unbelievable pacing, acting of Hugh Jackman makes this years Oscar winner look undeserving. Patrick Stewart was so entertaining. x-23 the little girl is amazing. The action is probably the best I've seen in any prior comic book movie or action genre in general. Def worthy of a watch or in my case multiple watches.",1
140,"Loved this movie more than I anticipated. Great performances by all the cast, especially that little girl - she almost steals the movie. I say almost because Hugh Jackman is amazing here, Oscar worthy, imo. Very violent, but that's to be expected.GO SEE THIS MOVIE and see for yourself.",1
141,"This movie was beautifully made. It starts off they way it should showing you what type of movie your in for. The introduction is strong showing what happened to Wolverine and his current story while introducing the villain all at the same time. This movie perfectly balances it's strong brutal violence with  strong emotional scenes throughout the whole 2 hour and 21 minute run-time. The way some of the action scenes kept you stressed and on the edge of your seat leaving you breathless but you have to see this more than just an action movie full of nitty-gritty violence. The emotional and strong messages that were included in this movie were strong and effective. The acting from every character is powerful and believable especially that of Dafne Keen who plays X-23. Altogether this movie is a perfect, bloody and emotional sendoff for Hugh Jackman and the pay-cut he took to get the R rating was greatly appreciated. You will be missed after a great 17 years. Great work James Mangold.9.5/10",1
142,"Logan deviates from the standard Marvel formula, retaining the angst of the movies but missing any attempts at levity or comedy.  Logan is now an old, broken down man who drives a limo for a living.  The world also seems broken, but I'm not explaining why where because that would be spoiling part of the movie.  I am a diehard Wolverine comic book fan, and so far I have been less that impressed with the dialogue and  characterization of him.  Not outright unhappy, just not truly happy.  I was happy with this movie.  Logan went from a more two-dimensional thug and turned into a complex man here, trying to cope with all the dirt and dragons that life metaphorically keeps throwing at him while keeping his inner demons at bay.",1
143,"This is the movie that Wolverine fans have been waiting for. A story full of tragedy, violence and grit; something that Wolverine comics have always had. This may be one of the few comic book movies that can evoke emotion from viewers and not just be a shiny spectacle for audiences to gaze at for 2 hours.",1
144,"Logan is a spectacular film, I'm just going to say that from the get go. Before I go into my enthusiastic ramble about this film, I noticed that Logan shares many tropes which call back to critically acclaimed Westerns like Shane & Unforgiven. These tropes are particularly seen through iconic comic book characters and it's refreshing narrative which was mostly inspired by the writings of Old Man Logan. Although being apart of the processed goods that is Marvel Cinematic Films, Logan perfectly closes the chapter of beloved comic book adapted characters Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) & Professor X (Patrick Stewart), whilst also subtly nodding at a bright future for new mutants. It's narrative balances the themes of Fatherhood, Depression, Loss, Family and Revenge. It is in fact the perfect balance of Robust Violence and Dramatic Themes that I have experienced since films Leon: The Professional, Road to Perdition & as previously mentioned, Unforgiven. To make things clearer, Logan is not a superhero film, but, instead it portrays the tale of aging heros desperately trying to find their way in a dystopian world where little to none of their kind stand. It's equally horrifically violent, emotional and intriguing in showing the development of Logan and his battle to care for his aging father figure Charles Xavier and an unexpected young ally Laura. The Production team and Director James Mangold should be greatly commended  for such a jaw-dropping send off to the iconic comic book character, Logan, portrayed by Hugh Jackman on screen for almost 20 Years!Logan: A+ (VG9)",1
145,"James Mangold's ""Logan"" proves that superhero movies don't have to be filled with action and witty one-liners in order to please the audience and it does it masterfully. Hugh Jackman gives a career-defining performance, as well as Patrick Stewart, and one can only hope that Marvel continues to deliver more movies like this one",1
146,"Absolutely, without a doubt, the single best superhero movie I have ever seen. Not only that, it is on the very top of my list of favorite ""real movies"" as well. I can't really come up with a better movie at this moment.We went to see Logan in the RPX so we could choose our seat. However, it was a Tuesday and the RPX is double the price of the discounted Tuesday prices for other showings that there wasn't a packed theater. This meant no distractions and we could focus on the movie.I can't go into too much detail here, I don't want this to have spoilers, but I can say I will post again and break it down. The movie had a huge personal impact.What I can say is this is not your Avenger's big tent action movie. The focus is on an aging Logan, Professor X and a young Laura (c'mon its not a spoiler if its in the trailer). Laura is being hunted by a group of powerful mercenaries and Logan and Professor X are trying to protect her.The R rating does allow people to see the brutality of what it would be like to fight Wolverine, limbs and heads amputated, faces clawed open and the absolute monster that Wolverine could be in a fight. That however was not what the rating really made better. The storytelling was much better. It could handle much more adult subjects such as aging, consequences of a life of conflict, and family. This movie is not for someone who is a child or who is only interested in a mutant battle. If that is the limit of a movie you are interested, go see the new Thor, Spider Man or Guardians of the Galaxy movies coming out this summer.I won't say anything else about the plot of the movie except to say it mirrors Deadpool in a way. Instead of redefining a superhero movie into a darker comedy, Logan transforms this movie into a gritty western as much as a superhero movie. It has a very broad, if very adult, scope for an audience. Some have talked about Oscars. I think it would be justified to receive best actor/supporting actor nominations if not the actual Oscars themselves.The emotional impact of this movie hit both me and the hubby that night. It was near the anniversary of my father's death (one year) and there were a lot of similarities, the movie was like a gut punch. Those I will talk about in my next post about Logan where I can break out spoilers.The biggest takeaway I saw another critic say is that the R rating is an excellent injection into the superhero niche. Not for violence, but for the way it can open a story up and allow superhero movies to grow up and become full stories, not just comics.It has been reported that this is Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's last movie each for their characters. 20 years of Wolverine and Professor X wrapped up on the best superhero movie made. I am sad they are turning in their characters, but I have to say it was absolutely the best movie they could have chosen to do so.The good: Absolutely the best acting in any superhero movie, and in the top for conventional movies. The story is tight, not distracted with explosions or too many special effects. It satisfies both the action need and the story need that no other superhero movie can.The bad: It is the last movie with Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman playing their characters.",1
148,"Logan is a fantastic send off to not only Hugh Jackman's Wolverine but mutants in general. The story and world completely encapsulates a dystopian future of an already troubled race. As an X-men fan since the 90's (GO MAGNETO!), this is my most emotional comic movie to date. The movie is without a doubt violent, depressive and powerful, a perfect harmony to create an unforgettable masterpiece.",1
149,"Logan is a gut wrenching, bloody, emotional, and amazing film. The film works not only as a super hero movie but as a western and drama as well. Hugh Jackman plays his best version of Wolverine yet and performances from others are rock solid too. The action, though, is brutal and extremely R-rated, giving the film a very different vibe from usual superhero movies. Finally, and most importantly, this film is not afraid to take risks in its moments and violence; a trait not often found in superhero movies, especially the MCU. Overall, Logan is not just a fantastic superhero movie and not just the best Wolverine and possibly X-Men movie to date, but it has already earned itself the title of being one of the best movies the genre has ever seen.",1
150,I created an account just to review this movie. That's how much it blew me away. It was awesome and intense and violent and had me on edge THE whole time. And emotional!,1
152,"Logan 's almost a masterpiece, one of the best super heroe movies ever, it's gonna change for good or bad that kind of movies forever and from now on the word Logan is gonna be the basic key in ever review you are gonna read about any super hero film.",1
153,"In an era where nearly all reviews either go full-on negative, or the wishy-washy middle of the road, Logan is not a title what should be there. The movie is in the same vein of gritty realism the Christopher Nolan Batman movies highlighted. The script is well written, though a tad unbalanced at times (the investment in a credible villain with more than a passing reason for be evil) shines in all the right places throughout the series.The rating is warranted; this is a hard R and shines for it. Blood and gore for the sake of Blood and gore does not make a movie good, but when used to TELL the story as opposed to appease the L.C.D (Lowest Common Denominator) does. Logan does this. I'm no way a squeamish person, but there are moments where I involuntarily winched at the carnage taking place.Worth the view, and a stellar way to send Hugh Jackman's Wolvie off into the proverbial sunset.",1
154,"This movie does for the X-Men movies what The Dark Knight did for superhero movies in general - elevate the content from superhero camp to being able to rub shoulders with genre fare. Great performances, gut-wrenching violence and cursing aplenty, but none of it feels juvenile (though a little forced at times, seeing as they can now get away with more with their R rating). Genuine emotion and strong themes of family are to be found throughout. My absolute favorite aspect of this movie are the touches of near-future America that we can see strewn throughout. Even if you're not a superhero genre fan, this movie will stand on its own as either a solid sci-fi action movie, or an indie-movie influenced road movie, or even a modern day Western. Highly recommended, see it in theaters ASAP.",1
156,"Saw the movie ""Logan"" last night.  Hugh Jackman will always be the Wolverine for me as he totally personifies the character!  An amazing and fitting end to him playing the character in X-Men!!  I would give the movie a 100 stars if I could-yep it was that good. I don't know how Marvel could ever top this.  They cast the character right in the beginning, and carried the story well all the way through to the end.  Me growing up on comics, living and breathing the, Marvel done the movies and the character justice all the way through.  Some others they haven't done so well with, again Hugh Jackman was and always will be Wolverine for me!!",1
157,"An absolute masterpiece! This movie's take on the character was unbelievably spot on, as the iconic Hugh Jackman as Logan. I never thought I was going to see such a dark twist on a superhero movie, but I can't be more pleased with the result. Congratulations to Hugh Jackman for this amazingly portrayed character, and all the other well casted actors, who made this movie a masterpiece.",1
158,"Logan is a brutal finale to the story of the Wolverine, filled to the brim with brutal action scenes and quiet, excellent character moments, this is a must-see not just for comic book or superhero movie fans, but just movie fans in general. It will make you flinch, laugh and maybe even cry. No matter what, this movie will hit you right in the gut. So long Logan, and thank you for the memories.",1
160,"LOGAN is a gratifying send off to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. Its a masterfully crafted movie with its gorgeous cinematography, perfect score and outstanding performances given by the lead. It's a simple , yet beautifully  put together story with its drama and great use of brutal action sequences. It definitely takes you on a dark and emotional ride.",1
161,"""Logan is The Dark Knight of the mutant-filled X-franchise""""Explicit violence and salty language (...) adds a bit of much-needed fizz to the Wolverine sub-franchise.""""Every frame feels perfectly rendered and absolutely necessary to the narrative trajectory.""""Perhaps the best X-Men movie yet.""""This is honestly one of the best comic book movies of all time.""My turn, poopyheads.Calling Logan the best X-Men movie because it's gritty and dark is like saying Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars movie because it's the most 'darkest'.Logan is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The senseless violence, the flat characters, and the painfully slow pacing take it in that path, and the utter and excruciating lack of plot set that in stone. I am absolutely astounded that this is getting good reviews, I honestly thought it would wither and die like Green Lantern or Fantastic Four(2015). Given the (the following words hurt my hands as I write them) 'critical acclaim' this movie is receiving, let me substantiate my review.Plot: All through the movie people are dying and things are happening. But what is the purpose of it all? Good storytelling does not consist in throwing events into someone's face, good storytelling is making those events matter. All through the movie right until the end I kept asking myself two questions: 'So what?' and 'Why do I care?' And those two questions are the whole basis of good stories. Is it that hard to ask for a movie with characters I can care about? A compelling plot that at lease makes sense? To my dismay, I have read several reviews comparing this with Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and I cannot in any way comprehend how people can insult Christopher Nolan to such a degree.Violence: Clearly inspired by Deadpool, this movie features waterfalls of blood. Senseless violence that is neither fun nor necessary. The Passion of Christ, Se7en, and most Scorsese and Tarantino movies are good examples of a good way to employ violence in movies. This is a great example of a terrible way.Characters: The only real character in the whole movie is Professor X, everybody else is flat and devoid of real purpose.Pacing: Stupidly long and extremely poorly paced.I do not recommend this movie to anyone.",0
163,"At the start already you ask yourself if you're watching the right movie.From there on it only goes downhill.It is such a depressing and sad movie, it literally hurts. To see these superheroes like that... ugh...The ending was just bad as well and stabbed your heart even deeper.They tried so hard to make a superheroes movie seem realistic, but then failed on many things. They also left many things unexplained. You're just getting thrown in in this ""new world"".If you really like Wolverine and the other characters depicted, you shouldn't watch this movie. Its just sad, as if the writer of the script wanted to kill himself.But I guess if you're depressed and want to see other people suffer, too, then this is the movie you will like.",0
165,"Not since ""The Dark Knight"" has a ""comic book movie"" come along with this much auteuristic fervor and individuality. In fact, I put the term ""comic book movie"" in quotes because - like Nolan's 2008 opus - James Mangold's ""Logan"" is a film that is so passionately crafted, it transcends the sub-genre itself. It would, quite simply, be an insult to label this as just a ""good comic book movie."" Forget Marvel. Forget DC. Forget comic book movies altogether. This is a motion picture with more character, originality, and style than most films in general. It's as much an action-thriller as it is a family drama and a road trip story, with characters so well-drawn out and well-realized that you feel you never want the ride to end. Though, when things do eventually come to a close, my God do they find a way to send it all off with class. This is the Wolverine film that James Mangold always wanted to make and the one that I'll always consider to be the best - even if it is the last. Hugh - it's been real, bub. You've more than earned your time off.",1
166,"X-Men fans, this film awaits you and we're not just talking X-Men, we're talking Wolverine over here. Logan, if not, will excite you off the seat until the movie's over. It's that ride you never want to get off and miss.",1
167,"After 17 Years debuting in the X-men Franchise, Hugh Jackman exits the role as Wolverine, a troubled loner with a heart of gold and claws of Adamantium. In the future of 2029, Mutants have almost become extinct. Logan, living with a dementia ridden Professor Xavier and a mutant recluse named Caliban, turns his back on mutantkind, instead attempting to make a living as a limousine driver to retire to the ocean. However, Logan's fate is changed when she meets a young girl with mutant powers very similar to his own.The Live Action X-Men franchise has often been accused of being disrespectful to the source material (or rather the more fantastical elements of said source material such as the Dinosaurs in present day of the Savage Land or the space opera adventures of the Starjammers), in an age where Marvel Studios explores space with Guardians of the Galaxy or the microscopic world with Ant-Man. In Logan, that grounded reality works to the benefit of movie. Instead of visual spectacle and technicolor explosions, the action grim, grounded and folded to reality. Unlike other attempts to 'mature' the genre through simple additions of profanity and violence, Logan uses its R rating to tell a more character driven story, showing broken old men at the end of their ropes. After years of a PG-13 rating, the R rating doesn't simply add blood and gore, but a sense of melancholy and bleakness other films of the same genre do not have. Logan has been described as the mainstream Superhero Western, a fair comparison since Superheroes have often been compared to the Western Boom of the 50's while scenes of 1953's Shane plays during a scene. The actors are fully giving it their all in this picture. Hugh Jackman has always had incredible range as an actor, but his turn as Wolverine is the thing that made him a star. It's only with an actor of his caliber and the age of playing the role for so long that you can get a performance of this magnitude with the emotional weight it deserves. Just the same, the usually reserved Patrick Stewart completely subverts his role as the kindly understanding Professor Xavier to a rambling, cynical cranky old man with a form of Alzheimer's. But, Dafne Keen will ultimately come out as the highlight of the film. It's hard to get children actors to put out a role of this magnitude but Keen's Laura manages to be both convincing as a child who's exploring the world for the first time and a violent killer in other scenes.The action set pieces are astounding. The fight choreography is stable, the edits manage to feel coherent and the amount of chopped limbs, beheadings and spilled blood makes for a gory good time.It's unclear where the X-men Franchise can go from here. After the critical disappointment of X-Men: Apocalypse but the financial success of Deadpool, fans have been counting the days when 20th Century Fox will sell the film rights back to Marvel Studios so the Mutants can become part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But, for the payoff we received at the end, Logan is worth the 17 years worth of X-Men films (Some Good, Some Bad, Most Mediocre) to see two actors have one last ride in what was some of the iconic roles in Superhero film history.See it!",1
168,"Not only the best Wolverine movie but easily one of the best Fox Marvel movies. Right up there with Deadpool. This movie really earns the R rating too, very gory and countless f bombs.",1
169,"Great story, great acting from the entire cast, great visuals and effects -- just a completely satisfying movie experience in a way that is not often the case with super hero movies.",1
170,"Wow! I was sick of X Men movies, but Logan makes me want more! If this film and Deadpool are the new direction for mutant comic book movies, then 20th Century Fox is doing everything DC wishes they could do, which is create a cinematic universe that has it's own style and dedicated audience. We already got family friendly super hero movies perfected by Marvel Studios, so don't try to copy their formula. Do your own thing that attracts a different demographic.",1
171,"It's the end of an era...and Hugh Jackman's final run as Wolverine proves to be a bittersweet but powerful film that cements his stand as one of the top A lister in the business. Jackman is one of a kind...an actor that is..'GASP'..well aware that his run as Wolverine was a great turning point in his career, and in return, he always gave it his all in his role. Oh yeah..what about the film? Suffice to say, it is a powerful film that transcends its genre, much like, dare I say it, The Dark Knight.  At its heart, LOGAN is a Western, and unshackled from normal genre conventions made Mangold bolder to create a more consistent and bolder vision than before. Gone is the 'mandatory' third act that marred his previous effort in The Wolverine, replaced with a violent, somber ending that benefits all the characters there. For the first time, we see the character in its 'R rated' glory but also in its rawness. Kudos to Patrick Steward, also reprising his role as Professor X as a bitter, obviously very sick, going on a last ride for a greater cause. While at the end, there is some cliche to its story line, the total package is absolutely great, and a great swan song for the whole 'original' cast. The X-Men series have always been the 'less consistent' in comparison to the MCU, but like X2, First Class, Days of Future Past and Deadpool before it, always gave the comic book genre its best films.  Bravo..",1
172,"Many people have asked why the name Wolverine isn't in the title of the latest X-Men movie. The reason is that this film is not for children. Logan is violent, vulgar, and disturbing, this film will give your kids nightmares. Logan is supposedly the last time Hugh Jackman will play Wolverine, it might also very well end the current X-Men film franchise, that has produced nine feature films and brought in billions of dollars. That being said, I expected an epic conclusion, the likes of which Marvel had never done before, and what I got was somewhat of a disappointment. It takes place in the future and yes, Logan is older, but he's still the Wolverine, so I was expecting a fair bit of fighting and chases, but it seems that was pretty much all this film has to offer. A deteriorating Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) claims that even though a new mutant hasn't been born in decades, he is speaking to one that needs help, and as it turns out he was right. Logan and Prof. X go to rescue the child and bring her to safety, while the government tries to stop that from happening. I get that this is the future and there isn't time to fill us in on everything, but there are some major plot holes with the story that are never explained. This may be a Wolverine movie, but it is also the conclusion of the X-Men, so what happened to everyone and everything else? The stories narrow focus is on these three and getting to their destination, with chase after chase and fight after fight. The film certainly has it's moments and more than it's fair share of F bombs, but where was the whole conclusion element to it? The epic end to one of the biggest franchises in the history of film just isn't there. The big draw seems to be that they finally went for the R rating and showed Logan's true personality and yes, they made the film much more realistic than any other X-Men film, but I didn't have that satisfied feeling when it was all said and done. As for Hugh Jackman, this was easily his best performance as Wolverine. You see his real personality and all that comes with it, and if this wasn't the type of film that it was, released when it was, I truly believe people would be talking about an Academy Award, he was really that good. The harsh reality is that X-Men as we know it, with the cast that we know is probably over, but the way they ended it leaves us with too many unanswered questions and a feeling of unfulfilled promise.",1
174,"Пожалуй не один фильм за последние лет пять не вызывал такой сильный резонанс во мне чисто с человеческой точки зрения. Я не являюсь фанатом Marvell или людей X но фильм вызвал у меня просто дичайший восторг в плане прикосновения к струнам души. Я шел на веселый боевичек про мясо и рассомаху, а получил драму про человека который просто устал жить. OST просто божественный, сразу после фильма вышел из кинотеатра, закурил и купил в айтюнсе всю дискографию Джонни Кеша. Фильм  лично для меня является очень приятным и неожиданным шедевром.",1
175,The best movie since BvS and could be the best Marvel movie ever. It's so good I feel it will be imitated for times to come. Their's a good chance it'll be my favorite movie of the year but their still is Justice League and Wonder Women.,1
176,This episode was just no as good as the other movies.  The whole movie logan was drunk or wounded it was really annoying to watch something. The ending was not what i expected.,1
177,"This is not a super hero movie, this is a western movie.The movie is violent, depressing and hard but is great, the Logan character is treated as it should be treated, like a man trying to escape from his past, trying to redeem himself and doing it but making the last sacrifice.This movie deserve your attention, please watch it and enjoy it.",1
178,"""This is what life looks like. People who love each other. A home. You should take a moment... Feel it"".It's very rare that a X-men (or any superhero movie), could be the hardest thing I've ever progress in terms of my thoughts and feelings. Much hard when writing about it. Heck, I wouldn't even call it a superhero movie, but a mixture of both western and drama in disguise. No one is safe and the stakes are higher than before. While the villains themselves aren't anything I would call ""great"", but they did felt like a real threat and wasn't too cliché to the story.Still...""Logan"" is one of the best non superhero movies I've seen in awhile. A sad but satisfying farewell to are fan favorite. A surprising character driven movie with real consequences. A bold and risky film that wouldn't have been made years ago in the hands of FOX. But I think it's the unexpected powerhouse that got me in many ways. Something the previous movies couldn't do.Much darker and gruesome than I expected. Remember in ""X-men: Apocalypse"" when Wolverine goes on a full rampage and violently kills all the guards, but most of it was off-screen, even through you can clearly see blood on the walls. Well take that scene and imagine actually seeing him tearing through people. Yeah, it really goes for it and that ain't a bad thing.Hugh Jackman has portrayed Wolverine for over seventeen years and this is by far his most powerful performance. It's the humanity and the depression of the character we never truly seen. Despite happening around him, Logan's true enemy is himself. Before the end of an era, he learns the meaning of family and being a hero for others. I know this may sound far-fetch, but I would go as far to say that Jackman deserves some award buzz for this. The raw emotion he brought to his scenes without any sloppy music under neath it, is achievement. Jackman will forever be Wolverine and nothing will top that.Patrick Stewart delivers his last and most heartfelt performance as Charles Xavier. In this movie, he isn't the same Professor X who know and love. He is 90 year old, suffers from dementia, and has a dirty mouth. But at the same time, he's the a father figure to Logan. The scenes between Stewart and Jackman are one of the few highlights of the film.Dafne Keen was fantastic as Laura/X-23. She captures the characters inner emotions just by her facial expressions that says so much than dialogue. What's more impressive that this is her first major role and already I'm interested of what she dose next.I have to give major credit to James Mangold for what he brings to this harsh, but beautiful film. I wouldn't say he's an absolute professional when it comes to action scenes and story, but the perfect balance of brutal and bleakness he brought to those scenes was freaking spot on. The Wolverine series have been all over the place in terms of quality and tone, but Mangold finally puts it on his feet. By giving me what I wanted for years and much more.Overall rating: ""Logan"" is a special kind of ride that hits you in places you wouldn't expect. I grinned and cried at the right moments. And that last shot was just perfect.Farewell bub.",1
179,"Even if Logan may feel enormously different from X-Men's original films, a surprisingly dramatic, entertaining and the same marvelous Hugh Jackman's interpretation mean a great ""goodbye"" to its characters.",1
180,"Tossing normal superhero-formula to the side to allow for a  more human and deeply emotional look at the iconic character, Logan brings some fresh ideas to the table while also serving as a proper send-off to Jackman's persona, who gives one of the best performances of his entire career.",1
181,"This movie is a 10/10 for me as it hits a lot of good things throughout the movie. While some people may be disappointed with the villains or the ending not being too impactful, I really found it so as this movie is pointing directly at Wolverine and some of the other main characters while also, in a way establishes a new generation (the children). The characters are beyond amazing, the storyline is interesting, the fighting scenes are really entertaining and interesting to watch while still feeling tense due to Logan not being able to regenerate as fast anymore. It's a drama that contains character development, intense moments, various scenes and character development and a really sweet way of wrapping up things.Credit has to be given to movies who do something differently and amazing and I think Logan and Deadpool did just that. Support amazing movies like these so that we can show these movie makers what we love the most.Story: 9/10Characters: 10/10Action: 10/10",1
182,Excerpt from Nerdent 'dot' Net Logan was the perfect standoff to Hugh Jackman’s run of the character he has been playing for the last 17 years. Though the film is Rated R and full of adult content ranging from substance use to bloody gore Mangold ties it together with a family vibe with all the characters. I believe it could’ve been more faithful to the source material though splintered fractions of Marvel characters hindered it. Stylistically the movie was a work of art from the cinematography to choreography. Where Wolverine will go from here is still to be seen but he will pop up sooner than later due to the character’s popularity.,1
183,"Although movie has more than two hours, we can't say that there was something unnecessarily concluded in this touching, but predictable story. This is the first X-Men film(after X-Men and X2) which has everything that had to be in action movie, everything that Wolverine's fans deserves. Without that balanced, bloody massacres, maximum efforts of actors and future, almost post-apocalyptic mood the last big-screen episode about James Howlett aka Wolverine wouldn't be so successfull. Jackman and Stewart gave everything they could from their characters, Dafne Keen was the next star of the show, despite the fact that X-23 didn't talk too much, also Boyd Holbrook and Stephen Merchant did excellent jobs playing as Donald Pierce and Caliban. Logan earned the honoured place next to the films like Iron Man, CA:Winter Soldier, X2: X-men united ans Spider-Man 2, as the memorable, nearly perfect movie from Marvel which also finished one great chapter in movie franchise about mutants.",1
184,"First you cannot give this movie 0. You are not a critic. Does the movie have flaws? absolutely! But we need to see the bigger picture. Logan in its sense is not a stereotypical superhero movie. This movie is for mature audiences it is not kid friendly. Just like Clint Eastwood did to westerns, Logan changes the aspect and reality of the superhero genre to make a movie that could exist in our own timeline in today's world. With heavy influences from Shane this really was logans last stand and it was done perfectly. It may not have the big sendoff that his death in the comic universe did however cover raw emotion and looked at themes around aging friendship family and living with your life choices. A few things I was disappointed at were we did not get the iconic suit and I felt that the end boss was a bit cliché (really wanted it to be sabertooth). However after thinking about it logans ultimate enemy was always himself! I am sad to hear that this could be the last time we see Hugh and Patrick however they did this film and their characters justice... Roll on deadpool 2!",1
185,"Лучший фильм по комиксам. Невероятная драма, фильм точно не для детей, да и крови много ( реально много ). Фильм действительно крут, советую всем не пожалеете.",1
186,"This movie sure is one of the greatest wolverine movies I've ever seen. The build up, characters and more serious scenes make this movie feel much more serious. Even though the story might not be very deep, its still a super serious Marvel movie. The ending was so damn good as well! How Laura which had been mute and different the whole movie, but loosened up towards the end and even calls Logan for dad as he's dying made me wanna cry so bad.. 10/10 imo, a must watch for everyone!",1
189,"I was actually really excited to see this movie, mainly because of all of the positive things I had seen and heard about it.  I came away thinking that the action was cool, I liked the interaction and development between Logan and Charles, and I liked the unfiltered dialogue.  However, as a whole, I thought the movie was pretty terrible.  It was immediately obvious when they stayed in the farm house that the whole family would die (and that weight didn't really seem to bother Logan).  The other mutant kids were all pretty useless and stupid too.  Why did they all gang up to defeat the human villain instead of actually doing anything useful to help Wolverine fight X24?  I mean, they showed that they actually had some useful and cool abilities but nope... just going to watch X24 kill Wolverine.  Oh, and when they showed the Adamantium bullet, you knew that would come back.  And that deus ex machina was actually terribly executed... If an adamantium bullet could actually kill them, how come any time they cut each other with their adamantium claws it could heal? WTF?!?!  Oh and good **** lord was this movie too long... really really too long.  By the end, I was laughing at parts that were supposed to be weighty, like the Shane speech lmfao.  All in all... what the **** was everyone watching when they thought it was one of the best movies of the year?  It was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  Not the worst only because I recently watched Honey Dripper...",0
191,I was pretty excited to see this movie when I first heard the premise.  I thought it would do well as a character focused movie - but the character's were hardly explored - with next to no character dialogue.  When Charles and Logan do talk - the word **** is so overused that it loses all impact.  I guess FOX wanted to follow up with the success of Deadpool but it tonally doesn't work.  The characters at best service the situation at worst are completely devoid of any true character.  I found myself feeling disconnected and bored - fighting to stay awake during this 2h 18m run time.Do not have any expectations for this movie.  Maybe you'll like it - mileage may vary as they say.,0
192,"It is such an astounding movie. It felt like finally, we saw what X-Men movies should have been like all along. All of the actors were amazing. Without spoiling anything, it is definitely a must see movie. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",1
193,"It is incredible how easy people accept today movies, specially x-men Saga, which with Logan became kind of Blood-GORE Movie.It has some good parts but the Movie itself was empty and without any real plot. What afraids me, that people just consume this kind of movies, without any critics anymore. No more Expectation, reminds me other movies like The Force Awakens. Anyway, I hope one day it will change again! We need goodmovies again.",0
194,"In and of itself, a good film.Not a good part of the X-Men line.  Disrespects chunks of the source material.  Or, simply discards the entire X-men franchise because all the heroes ate GM food?  Lame.  Almost as lame as time travel is the use of a 'clone'.  Lazy production if you can't come up with an original enemy.Some of us liked X-Men 1-3 & DoFP.  It seems we're a minority here.....",0
195,"The fix must have been in on this one because it was awful- predictable, clichéd, nonsensical, small attempts at humor fell flat, boring physical settings, even the violence wasn't interesting.",0
197,"After watching Logan at my nearest movie theater, I was blown away of how emotional, epic, and lighthearted that movie was compared to other R rated movies that I've seen in cinema history. Sure, the movie is bloody, dark, and profane. But at the same time, it shed light that makes us laugh, shock, or even weep when this is the last time that Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart had to play their iconic characters on the big screen. Aside from that, the little girl that played Laura, Dafne Keen, was phenomenal! She literally kicks ass in that movie! To be honest, I cannot wait to see what other work that she'll be doing in the near future. Speaking of that, James Mangold, the director that directed Logan did a fantastic job on setting up this film's direction by exploring the optimism and the seriousness when it comes to the final moments for Wolverine's story. The performances, cinematography, action intensity, and visual effects were outstanding in this film. For some reason, this movie felt very different than any other superhero film adaptation that I've ever seen in my whole entire life. Unlike Deadpool and The Dark Knight, we're thrown into a story that had a fantastic diverse range of characters, plot points, and moments that kindly fondled quite well that actually wrapped up this film right! Without a doubt, this movie is The Dark Knight of X-Men movies and it's considered to be known as a cult classic of the 2010s. Plus, this movie is bound to get the Oscars that it deserves. Thank you Hugh Jackman and Sir. Patrick Stewart for the memories. I'm so glad that I watched this movie because of you guys.",1
198,"Finally, a Wolverine film that delivers the sublime violence and heart rending rage befitting this enigmatic and iconic characer. The storyline is gripping, and the cinematography coupled with exceptional choreography makes for a sumptuous visual feast. Then there are the performances; magnificent. Keen and Jackman are superb, and Stewart is unforgettable. This film stands alone and above its genre counterparts as a sophisticated and brutal exploration of a dark future with poignant subtext for viewers today. You don't need to be a genre fan to enjoy this exceptional film. 8.99/10",1
200,"Perfection in cinema. This is Marvel's equivalent to The Dark Knight. Emotional,visceral and true to the character of Wolverine/Logan. What a great sendoff",1
201,"Logan was released in 2017 and was directed by James Mangold. The film is a new instalment in the X-Men universe and is the final film starring the centre characters of Logan (Wolverine) and Charles Xavier, showing them tasked with protecting a young girl.What I love about this film is that it doesn't feel like your average superhero movie (evident from the trailers) and is instead a very human story, hence the title going for Wolverine's human name of 'Logan'. Over time we've seen people's expectations for comic book change quite drastically and we're in a period of time now where expectations are changing rapidly. However, this film bravely ignores the trends and goes for what it wants to be and I highly appreciate it for that.To start off with, this movie does indeed have an R rating and is very brutal. I knew this was going to be something before I even saw it and I was kind of afraid whether or not this would be too big of a change from the previous X-Men films. Thankfully, the R rating felt necessary and required and if the film was PG-13 it would have nowhere near as much of an impact. The fact that more strong language is included too was another concern I had for it being too big of a change but it makes sense for the characters to use this language considering what stage they are at in their lives and didn't feel like it was there just for the sake of it.The main three characters of the film are brilliant; Hugh Jackman gives a great performance as Logan and also Patrick Stewart gave a unique, emotionally deep performance as Charles Xavier, showcasing a side to the character I never thought I'd see. Newcomer Dafne Keen was also very promising as the new character Laura Kinney. Showing these characters at the dark point in their lives made for an overall more emotionally involving story and makes them discover each other in a much deeper way than they ever had before and for once the main characters feel like a family instead of just a team. The way they all interact was amazing to see and adds up to the overall 'human' theme of the story.What I probably loved the most about the film (like I mentioned just then) is how it was a human story, ignoring the trends other comic book movies are going for and being what it wants to be. It's also clear that this is a film not made solely for the money but one for the fans; you can tell they aren't adding things in simply for extra money (for example the film wasn't shot in 3D), there's no big beam in the sky for the characters to fight at the end and it also takes into consideration what films do for people in real-life too, as in the end credits it says that the film help supply thousands of jobs and it's amazing to see when a film goes the extra level with thought like that, especially nowadays when most movies are made for the money.Overall, I loved how much thought was put into this film and the fact that it was what it wanted to be, especially for the time period of superhero movies that we're in at the moment. The main cast give brilliant performances and was a great send-off for the characters we know and love. I did have one or two problems with the film (which will be in my spoiler section), however they weren't enough to hold down the film in quality. Even if they don't continue to make superhero films like this in the future, we'll always have Logan.8.2/10I've just got to mention that this was my most anticipated film of 2017 and the fact that I saw it the day it came out and also thought it was great made my day",1
202,"James Mangold's Logan, the third installment to the Wolverine franchise goes out with a bang for Hugh Jackman's last outing as the titled character. I thought this movie was great, very well written, and loving the cinematography, the feel of it. Lets talk about characters, Hugh Jackman as an older Logan to me was done greatly, so was Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier/Professor X, their dynamic was fun to watch, like father and son. Also, absolutely love Dafne Keen as Laura Kinney/X-23, she didn't speak for most of the movie, but did a darn great job every time on screen. Also enjoyed the dynamic between her character and Logan, would have liked a little more to the father/daughter relationship, but it was good nonetheless. There were somethings I wish could've been different, but a very solid film. Some other actors I thought that deserve praise Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce and Stephen Merchant as Caliban, both did great jobs. Overall, great R rated superhero film, western vibe, drama driven, brutal action. Also to me, the best of the Wolverine movies.",1
203,"For me it has been the most enjoyable X-men/Wolverine film so far. I appreciate that the creators did not hesitate to depict brutality and kill characters. So the story is well-written, entertaining and sometimes even dramatic.",1
204,"8.8 user score for this movie is the reason why the US president is Donald Trump. You guys clearly, blindly love guns and blood in movies, paying $10 to see the same movie every few months, ugh...Part of me wants to give this movie a 0 just to bring the user score down, but I have to be honest and rate it higher. It's not a 0. But it is definitely a 3.Most of what makes this movie a 3 is the plot holes, and how inaccessible it is as a standalone film for those that aren't Wolverine die-hard fans. Actually, I don't know if being a die-hard fan might make the movie WORSE for you, because it's a bad movie of something you like. Anyways, I know people think that those who gripe about plot holes are jerks that are overly critical and hate fun, but that's not me. I like fun. I think if you make a movie about an action hero, it's probably going to be an action movie, and we all know there isn't any shortage of movies with fight/gun scenes, so you have to freakin' do something to separate yourself from just being another action movie... Logan (the film) does this mostly by throwing Logan (the character) in our face with different sides of his emotional character.Why is he so sad? Why is he suicidal? Why does he do anything he's doing? Why does it feel like he's given up? I was interested in these sides of his character, but near the end of the movie just didn't care anymore because I was so bored. The movie makes Logan-claw-action scenes boring by then, by having too many of them. The characters talk too much and simultaneously say too little, and this movie isn't dialogue driven at all. Near the end of the movie I strongly suspected that X-23 and/or Logan were primal screaming just to wake up people who may have fallen asleep in the theatre. Anyways, I'll mention some good parts about this movie:-I thought some of the action stuff was creative. But there is too much ""meh"" action in this movie.-The movie has a certain atmosphere to it. But it doesn't really do much with the atmosphere. It's just one of those things that could have been done better, so it's barely a plus.-The gore is surprising and satisfying, but near the end you will not care anymore.Now the bad, and then after I will list some huge plot holes:-X-23 is not mute but gives the weakest excuse for not talking until close to the end of the movie.-Logan is WAY too tortured of a protagonist in this movie. It gets annoying after a while. Like, stop complaining and finish the mission.-Who the HELL are these antagonists? They might as well have been the grey putty men from Power Rangers, holy cow the movie doesn't explain their motives well enough.-Logan's ""powers"" are good when broken up by other mutant powers, but this movie attempts to carry itself using only Logan's powers (and guns of course, Hollywood's favorite prop for moving movies along these days). It does not work to good effect. When other powers are introduced it is only at the end of the movie.-When X-23 turns the cross on Logan's grave to make an ""X,"" I hard-cringed in disgust.Now for plot holes, which I know you all have been waiting for me to get to:-Okay, you have to get to North Dakota, why the HELL are Logan, X-23 and Prof. X stopping so damn much? What's with all this side-questing??? GET TO THE OBJECTIVE, STOP LOLLYGAGGING AND GETTING THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU KILLED.-Logan's friend, Calaman or Kalavan, whatever his name is, kills himself so that the antagonists can't use him to track Logan and X-23 anymore near the end of the movie... but why doesn't he do this AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE???-Near the end of the movie, why are the children running away from the soldiers? They have POWERS, which they later use in unison against the main antagonist, WHY NOT BUNKER DOWN AND FIGHT THE SOLDIERS THAT ARE COMING AFTER YOU???-How does Logan run 8 miles that quickly? He caught up to helicopters, armed trucks and the children he chased after to rescue at the perfect time, what is this nonsense?-Why does Logan even die? Are you really telling me that the children ran out of green juice that heals Logan on the exact date that they were rolling out to make it to the final safe haven???-Why does the movie end BEFORE we see the final safe haven???To conclude:With the 5000 char limit on Metacritic I can only condense my anger at this film, but I have so many more words. This review may have come through as sporadic, shotgunning my disdain for the terrible tropes of Hollywood filmmaking at a film based off of something that I liked growing up, something that stood for a cool berserker rage that is supposed to be aimed at a faceless evil we all want to lash at. If I could transform this movie into such a force, redirecting our loved berserker back at Hollywood, I would want this action to convey that this is a bad movie, and those who made it should feel bad for making it.I asked for my money back afterwards...",0
205,"DO NOT SEE.  The critical praise for this film is highly suspect.  I think critics are seeing so many bad movies that Logan becomes palatable due to it's (few) redeeming qualities.  BUT THIS MOVIE IS NOT GOOD.  If you must see it, wait to see it at home for cheaper.  I walked out before the last 25 minutes of the movie it was so bad.",0
206,"The movie was bad for the sole reason that it was boring to allow me to sum up logan I'm logan aka wolverine is a limo driver and is sad and of course, I still want to **** kill myselfthat is most of  the logan and of course, there are a load of minor plots that just kind of happen for no reason there are entire 40-minute scenes that all mean nothing this is a boring movie",0
207,"What is this thing 2.5 hours for?!  The current crop of studio exec donkeys have no say, no balls, no brains anymore not to start putting an end to these self indulgent bloated overlong flicks!  It's an across the board rampant problem.  This thing would do better at 90 minutes, and don't make the argument it has been doing just fine as is because it can always be better.  These filmmakers can't even turn in a reasonable length cut anymore and are too stupid to realize we out here are sick and tired of sitting through their padded formulaic slogs.  The only people satisfied by it are pushover geeks, shills in the jackass critics herd, or those who haven't seen many movies in their lives.  Those of us not in one of those three categories find the formula so very, very tired.  Little girl and tough guy.  Never seen that before.  R rated comic book movie as western?  The novelty wears off in the first twenty minutes.  This director has made good movies, most notably the excellent ""Copland"" (10 rating here), so he knows what he's doing.  And Jackman is a good actor and big star, so why can't he make a single good adult movie?  ""The Prestige"" was an almost, good right up until the end.  ""Prisoners"" sure as ---- was not!  You look at the track record of big action-drama stars over the years, everyone from McQueen to Eastwood to Ford, and so many others and all made many venerable movies which hold up for all audiences.  That's how they became big stars.  Now a physical look and a superhero franchise falsely give an actor that status.  It's not legit. *    The ""Deadpool"" short/scene tease playing with the feature is awful!  The audience (the built-in audience that is) did not react at all.  No laughs, no clapping, nothing.  Dead silence.  Meaning they also thought it sucks!  That character and new franchise along with its actor are a degenerate embarrassment no matter what the geek legions say.",0
208,"absolutely outstanding marvel movie- one of the best superhero movie with mind blowing performance from hugh jackman,he is superb, shines his last role as logan with utmost dedication n terffic performance ,new comer dafne as laura steal the show- awesome n violent action sequence blow your mind- not just action movie- movie with heart n soul !i loved it",1
209,"Even beyond the gore, clear setup and failed execution of comic relief, and depressing atmosphere, Logan has a muddled plot that ditches exposition and character development in favor of comic book references and severed limbs.Logan has the setup of a standard Marvel movie, attempting to balance gritty, engaging action with light-hearted comic relief. Its sad, dark angle befits the premise: the main character is being poisoned by his own super-powered skeleton. This angle, however, crosses the line from dark to melodramatic as mentions and visual imagery of blood, pus, brains, and guts overshadow the ""internal struggle"" Logan is supposed to be enduring. The supposed ""deep existential crisis"" that Logan suffers regarding his repeated murders of people around him is unbelievable when he repeatedly, intentionally goes out of his way to kill people when he had the option to do literally anything else. His counterweights, the optimistic Charles Xavier and adorable daughter Laura balance out Logan's grit and angst...or, that is, they would if they had anything meaningful to say throughout the movie. Laura is mute until the very end, which serves as a clever bait-and-switch at the expense of her narrative potential as a character, and Charles spends most of his time on screen explaining that Logan is indeed dying without adding why it's happening or what to do about it. Even the villains are carelessly slapped together: their organization manufactures child soldiers from the DNA of mutants like Wolverine and are trying to track down Laura and the other mutants like her because they are the creations of said organizations and do not deserve to see the outside world. Individually, however, these characters have no depth. There's a scientist, a bounty hunter, and a Wolverine clone, and that's all you'll ever learn about them.The Good: convincing acting, Charles being adorable when he's not spouting faux exposition, Laura being charming when she finally opens her mouthThe Bad: sub-par comic relief, lack of clear exposition and motivation for villains, two most engaging characters rambling on about how Logan is ""being POISONED"" and staying mute for most of the film, respectivelyVerdict: I'd recommend this to die-hard fans of X-Men who would watch anything with Wolverine's face on it and literally nobody else. There is no substance to speak of in this Suicide Squad-esque cash grab of a film.",0
210,"The lesson Fox will learn from this and Deadpool is if they make their comic book movies totally unsuitable for the people the characters were created for, ie. Children, then they can cash in. If you enjoy watching people stabbing each other with knives over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, you will enjoy 'Logan'.",0
211,"Pros: The rather boring and tepid X-men movies have their overwrought coda and maybe Patrick Stewart's role in these piles of garbage will be forgotten.Fox will no longer beat the dead horse of a sterilized vision of Marvel's more adventurous comic book series.While it's nice to see action scenes not obscured by the usual shake-cam garbage that plagues most movies, the violence is Peckinpah-esque and I guess that will appeal to the man-child sociopaths who will be flocking to this movie for their dose of male power fantasy.Cons: A further continuation of Fox's butchering of the Logan character.  Without Wolverine's failed samurai / weeaboo aspect or any hint of the internal conflict that made up a crucial part of the character (his bestial side) the character lacks any sort of nuance. Instead the only real internal conflict comes from his pining for the redhead girlfriend of the king of toolbags: Cyclops.Everything is so serious. Much of the movie's framing assigns importance and gravity to the ridiculous and frankly silly plot points and scenes.In a phrase: it tries too hard.",0
212,"Logan is probably the most violent movie I have ever seen. Extremely bloody, profane, raw and disturbing. Logan has a theme of kidnapping and child abuse, which is hard to watch because these kids are being hunted down by all. It scared me to see a family murdered one by one, and I was a bit freaked out. The script is very lazy, with many swear words inside. The good part of this movie is the acting. Hugh Jackman did a fantastic job as Logan, but the other characters' performances do not fit in as much with Hugh Jackman's style. Patrick Stewart does not do such a great job as a leading role, and it almost seems like Hugh Jackman has to be there all the time in the scene so we don't completely freak out. I understand how some people would like this movie, speaking of which that it is ""Marvel's Dark Knight."" I am not a huge fan of superhero films, nor am I a fan of dark superhero films, but this one seemed different. I'd rather see a movie where I could follow along and enjoy the plot and suspense as we go. The plot in Logan isn't that spectacular, and they use references to the X-Men comic books in the movie just to remind us that this movie was based on a deep comic strip. This is only my opinion, but I wished the violence wouldn't be so non-stop, bloody and cheesy. Not a fan of these films, and it has ruined my small liking of superhero films. I do like LEGO Batman, though!",0
213,"If you like extreme violence and bloodshed, including small children participation, you will love this movie. The critics apparently not only like this sort of thing but feel no obligation to warn their readers about it. There are no redeeming features, like a plot, to make you feel like the violence has any reason to exist. What has our culture become? Ugly and sad.",0
215,"I have no idea what people are smoking with this one. This film is barely ok. It's better than other super hero films, but that doesn't mean much. It's a cheesy R rated country western made for teenagers. There is really nothing else to say about it. What everyone sees in this film is beyond me. It has huge logistical problems and it's predictable. There is nothing here that hasn't been done a thousand times before. If I was a kid I guess I would have enjoyed it. Adults shouldn't bother.",0
216,"A last hurrah for Hugh Jackman, his Wolverine, and the first era of X-Men movies. Completely uncensored and brimming with emotion. The R-rating was used to good effect here. The blood and gore were perfectly fitting for a character who fights bad guys with razor sharp(er) claws. It's done tastefully and not in an over-the-top sort of way for shock value. The profanity also fits Logan, even if it's earlier usage in the film comes off as a bit forced when even Xavier starts dropping F-bombs. Yet, for all of it's gritty flash that makes things so exciting to watch, it's the emotions running through the tale that give the movie it's strength.The relationship between Jackman and Stewart's Logan and Xavier is just as potent as that between Logan and his newly found daughter, Laura. The performances from the entire cast is surprisingly nuanced. The layers behind them and the meanings to their actions are often expressed without any words at all. Dafne Keen is an absolute firecracker. A fine potential lead/replacement to carry the series further should they choose to do so. Boyd Holbrook plays the best comic book movie villain in quite some time, and Stephen Merchant is a real scene-stealer as mutant tracker Caliban.Being partially based on the Old Man Logan series, it was interesting to see how well the setting was sold. Those comics sort of had a post-apocalyptic vibe going for them. This movie does as well despite clearly not being set in a post-apocalyptic world. There's some impressive wizardry going on here. You'll notice influences from a lot of other genres outside of the standard comic book movie affair. Sometimes it feels like a western, others like a family drama, and even like an end of the world type of film. Yet, at the end of the day it's a character driven story. This is without a doubt the most diverse comic book movie thus far.It's going to be interesting to see where the X-Men movies go from here. There's plenty of potential to go forward in new ways as well as a new middle chapter to flesh out thanks to the still game-changing effects of Days of Future Past. The difference now is that they are going to have to move forward without Hugh Jackman, which should mean no Wolverine as well (who wants to follow that act?). A pretty big challenge to overcome given that even the movies that weren't stand-alones were very Wolverine-centric. So long as the people behind these movies can keep things as unique and well-executed as this movie, then they'll be okay. Regardless, our last outing with Wolverine (at least with Hugh Jackman in the role) is a grand one. There's much more depth than you would expect, it doesn't goof around with the R-rating, does the title character a lot of justice, and stands as one of the best superhero movies currently created.9.4/10",1
217,"Beautiful, Brutal, and heartbreaking. More of an old school western in the style of ""True Grit"", Logan is the comic book movie we have waited a generation to see.",1
219,"I am a little disappointed, but all in all it was a decent viewing experience. It's a good thing the kid was ""mute"" during most of the movie, since a poor child actor can be a kiss of death for your movie. I liked the dialogue at times, the cursing was refreshing, and the gore was great. I can't wait to re-watch it at home, to explore all the small details I might have missed at the cinema.",1

222,"I am one of those people who are extremely hesitant to give a movie, or anything, a perfect score. For ""Logan""? That's where I have to do it. This movie has its flaws, sure, but the same can be said about all great movies. The fact is this movie does so much more right that the flaws are easily overlooked. The movie has great acting, a great story, and hits you emotionally in ways you never thought a superhero movie could. In fact, the drama and acting in this film are so great it makes you forget it's a superhero movie. Not that I dislike superhero movies are want to talk down to them, because they're some of my favorites. However, very few could be considered highbrow the way ""Logan"" is. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart have great chemistry together and both are in top form. Dafne Keen also did a great job as well and was highly believable, something you don't see from child actors. Basically, if they acted in the movie and they weren't an extra or a minor character it was great. The movie is dark and broody, but doesn't take itself too seriously at times. It can make you laugh but will also make you cry. It's an emotional rollercoaster. If you were thinking about catching ""Logan"" the answer is, ""Yes. Do it.""",1
223,"Very good X-Men movie, well worth the ticket price, but falls just short of greatness. I may have gone in with overinflated expectations because I forgot to take all the rave reviews in the context of the X-Men movies and I let myself be fooled that this was a ""masterpiece"" in the general sense. It's not. It's up there with the best X-Men movies, possibly the best Wolverine movie, but it's not up there with the best movies in general. I liked the realism and the drama they used in place of the usual superhero fare of endless fights (though they didn't disappoint in terms of stabby Wolverine-y scenes either) and shoddy plots, but it still wasn't as good as ""Unbreakable"" (2000) or the first season of ""Jessica Jones"".",1
225,"Ya está aquí 'Logan' la película que me hizo ponerme al día con los mutantes para verla de la mejor manera posible, y la verdad, no decepcionó. La madurez en los temas que trata la película, ese ocaso de los personajes, ese tono crepuscular y el tratamiento de temas como la relación entre padres e hijos hacen que para mí en cuanto película sea la mejor que he visto de superhéroes (no la que más me gusta, aunque es de las que más también. Un ejemplo: me gusta más que el caballero oscuro). La película no solo es buena, si no que mola un rato: amputaciones, cabezas rodando y vísceras no faltan en ninguna secuencia de la película. Y la niña, vean a la niña... ugh ugh. La película siempre lleva el guión a las últimas consecuencias y las cosas que pasan, duelen. Lo dicho, peliculón, no solo de superhéroes, sino de los buenos. Un 9.",1
226,"A fantastic drama which shows that where Logan's claws cut deepest, is the human heart. An exciting action movie that made my heart race with every action sequence for the first time in my life. Logan is dark, it is gritty and violent, but it's also very much human. I did not see this as a superhero movie because of the themes and message it tries to send. From the get-go it's clear that this isn't a movie for kids, but for adults. The result is a movie that stays true to the character of James Howelett, and ultimately is a love letter to the fans.  I've watched it twice this week. First on Wednesday March 1st, then again on Saturday March 4th. It truly exceeded all expectations. Brilliant perfomances from all actors, especially Hugh Jackman. He truly gave all of himself for this one.",1

Even Wolverines Nemesis was another circle jerk around Wolverines character. The movie was depressing and miserable, but also had a underlying mean spirited resentful bitterness about it. Can you people seriously go to Canada like you promised.",0
235,"Logan is a perfect send-off to the character that Hugh Jackman played for 17 years this film is a different comic book movie, The film was shot on location and it does not rely on CGI a lot the film also has an amazing story. This is one of my favorite comic book movies of all time and it deserves it's title of Greatest comic book movie of all time alongside Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight",1
236,"With the X-Men franchise struggling to stay afloat in the waters of cinema, it has been in dire need of an influx of strength, so as to catch a breath of fresh air. I am happy to report that Logan provides that strength.The plot may not be terribly original, but it moves quickly enough--with the exception of the second act--to remain engaging and provides sufficient tragic twists to make it emotionally investing. Hugh Jackman arguably gives his best performance as Logan as he allows the darkest sides of the character to roll forth in his facial expressions and spot-on line delivery. Logan is not for the faint of heart. Its brutal violence and dark themes are sure to make stomachs church and hearts ache. But this is the side of Wolverine that we have always wanted to see and it serves as a more than satisfying farewell to Marvel's beloved--if flawed--hero.Story: 6.5Acting: 8Script: 10Visuals/Sound: 8.5Entertainment Value: 9MY RATING: 8.4/10",1
237,"This is nearly 2/3rds of an almost great film; a personal, brutal, honest, original take on the superhero myth. But the final act is a letdown; like something from an inferior mundane take and one that undermines some of that which was built up to that point.What's strange and transfixing for a while is how deeply cynical this film is. The mutants are dead, Xavier senile and hurting those he loves, Logan is dead inside; an alcoholic husk taking care of his dying father in some abandoned silo in the desert. Until of course, life intervenes (through a child no less) and he's forced to find his humanity once again.It is built into the structure of the movie that this is another one of those false hopes. That they lived their whole lives for this cause which didn't' work and which never truly saved Logan's soul. Xavier makes it his duty to try one last time. In this sense, the cynicism and brutality is earned and just. It doesn't just shock and awe, but conjure mood and distaste; it drives a stake through the ""angry dude with a heart of gold"" byline that normally accompanies Logan - here he's a bit of a sadist with no carnage filter anymore.Yet, after a soulful mix of scenes involving an old-fashioned family and their farm, the movie kicks into manic superhero vs. villain let's save the world mode. The deaths pile up too fast; the poor Munson family is slaughtered, yet in the face of Xavier's death and all the other action we don't get to feel the full weight of this collateral damage and we are supposed to take it at face value and keep rolling with the nihilism.Then there's a lot more mind-numbing violence at the end, too much and too chaotic for it to register as much more than useless noise (unlike the earlier fight scenes). Logan wants to save the kids from having to kill yet they do that just as well here and you're supposed to cheer. Logan gets a fitting death, finally at peace by destroying the demon within, though you wonder how much is really his fault at this point? Is this a fitting metaphor for him? A good man who has killed many bad guys. The movie seems to say that bad guys have to die but you're still killing them, so that's bad so you're bad so beat yourself up about it and tell the kids this is conflicting stuff so don't mess with it. But the kids have to kill bad guys anyway (comic book antics and special effects...). The anti-hero tropes have been piled on too thick by now, and I think a little more sanity may have helped out in the end.",1
238,Comic book inspired films have been very popular during the last decade and there are some really good productions. Logan is obviously a film whose origins came from this genre but has travelled so much further.  This is the elegy for our favourite mutan and a fitting goodbye.  In this darkest and last installment the physical and mental torment brings new depth to the character and elevates the film to heights where possibly only Nolan's Batman has managed to reach in the past.  Thank you Hugh.,1
239,"Critics are stating this is not the usual superhero movie which is why I went to see it.  I know now they are referring to the human interest part of the film, as the rest of the movie is the usual villain vs. good guy predictability.  It was way more gory than it needed to be with a lot of cursing, so I would not recommend this film for a young audience.  Hugh Jackman is terrific in the film, as is the young girl (Dafne Keen).  Not a film I would ever want to see again, as it was too gory and predictable for my taste.",1

243,"This was a pretty great movie. A lot of people I know thought the violence was unnecessary and detracted from it, but I thought it was the opposite. The violence is actually meant to distract you from the movie's heart, which is perfect symbolism for Logan's entire life.",1

245,"I applaud the decision to make an R-Rated picture featuring the Wolverine. It elevated this movie above all other X-Men installments for me and more than made up for the messy attempts at exploring the character in Origins & The Wolverine. Initially I wondered how the film would fare with so little X-Men billed, but not only does it benefit from such exclusions; it excels in their absence. The main cast had terrific chemistry and ultimately led the plot to a heart rending finale which did fine justice of seeing out Logan's story.",1
246,"Best Wolverine film, Jackman is great and there are some great scenes, death is a bit forced though.",1
247,"Am I crazy in thinking that Logan is good enough to start stirring up some conversation when awards season hits? James Mangold’s long-awaited, much-ballyhooed, R-rated entry in the final chapter of Wolverine’s trilogy still manages to be a surprising delight despite all the hype.There are R-rated films that are violent in order to grab more eyeballs, and there are R-rated films that are violent because it’s necessary. This one’s definitely in the latter, and like Deadpool it is true to its truest form – as in, there’s so much blood and dismembered body parts it’s impossible to even forget for a second that you’re watching a film about a man who likes to stab a lot and has metal claws in his hands that go snikt!The year is 2029, and due to some nefarious doings of a mystery science company a mutant has not been born in a quarter-century. An old Logan (Hugh Jackman) spends his days working as a no-nonsense limo driver shuttling back and forth from Texas and Mexico, haunted by a drinking problem and a bad cough. His healing factor has slowed with age, just as the rest of his body has, and remains one of the last of the mutants along with Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Xavier's brain disease continues to progress and causes him to lose control of his immense and deadly power, and now lives in an overturned water tower that slightly resembles Cerebo. They’re joined only by Caliban (Stephen Merchant), an albino mutant who has the ability to track other mutants and who serves as Xavier’s day-to-day caretaker. Everyone is tired, and life is a drag.The X-Men have long since disbanded, but the Wolverine is still a household name, and a nurse tries to enlist his help in escorting an 11-year-old girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), to a place called “Eden” in North Dakota. Logan initially refuses, but eventually takes the job in exchange for a hefty payout. Along the way, though, he runs into Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), a heavy-duty security guard whose job is to keep a mysterious science company’s secrets under wraps. As Logan and Laura go on the run, their symbiotic relationship becomes the heart of the story.  Logan serves itself very well because of just how few characters it has, a nice change of pace from the previous X-Men films that feel overcrowded and make you wonder which actors are actually playing mutants and which ones accidentally walked onto the wrong set. Every scene seems like a character study, and even the minor characters are as every bit as memorable as the stars. Everything seems to make sense and carry genuine emotion.It’s such a major improvement over Mangold’s previous effort in The Wolverine, an uneven, big-budget summer film that had a hackneyed love story and a hackneyed villain, a structure studios stubbornly and stupidly drift towards because it’s been proven to make a lot of money. Logan’s advantage was here – a story that manages to be both deeply violent and deeply personal because there were good reasons it had to be. The studios were so unsure of its success Jackman took a pay cut in order to reduce some financial risk, and Mangold filmed the bloody scenes with practical effects because he thought it would look more aggressive and visceral.Mangold’s films always look very good, and the cinematography from John Mathieson, who previously worked on X-Men: First Class and the criminally underrated The Man from U.N.C.L.E.¸ is also astounding, with its dust clouds, washes of orange and limited use of bright colours making it look just like a classic Western. Marco Beltrami’s score is very good, and sounds every bit like a man preparing for his inevitable final stand. The actions scenes are smooth and intelligible, and seeing how Hacksaw Ridge just won an Oscar for its clarity in editing action sequences, is hopefully the start of a hard charge in the opposite direction of hyperactive editing.We now have definitive proof that R-rated superhero films can be successful whether they’re crude or brutal, but they can’t be crude or brutal just for the sake of it. The X-Men universe has always been known for its social commentary, and hopefully the success of Logan will help realize a new niche for hyper-focused, character study dramas that involve comic book characters living in very real worlds.",1

252,"A very good and adult conclusion of the Wolverine-Story. Dramatic scenes are emotional and the action sequences make fun watching them. Because of NOT being ""T""-Rated the movie feels serious and not fantasy-like. Worth watching it!",1
253,"The X-men franchise has been going for a long time now. Most movies in it have been a mixed bag of good, great, bad and downright bizarre. In varying ratios. Logan, at long last tells a good complete story and does it well. They aren't saving this world this time. Just a handful of interesting colorful characters with simple straightforward goals. And character development. Nearly as much as all the other X-men films combined. By going this way it makes us so much more invested in the characters and the outcome. And as an end of an era sort of movie, no one is safe. Its a welcome change. This is not the most action packed X-men movie ever. Or the flashiest. Its been compared to old Western movies. Rightly so. But I think that makes it truer to the source material. Its capturing what was best about the comics. Oddly the best thing about Logan may just be the evenness of it all. Power balance and power creep is a huge problem in action movies these days. How many times can indestructible CG Superman punch CG Doomsday before we stop caring? Neither one is getting hurt in any meaningful way and the fight is dull until that changes. There are too many examples of that in modern movies to list. Here Logan is old. Doesn't heal as well. And he's met his match. No one is super OP. There's no deus ex machina moments in this film and the movie is so much better for it. The change to being R rated is a most welcome one. In addition to making the world feel more grounded, it really helps drive the stakes for the central characters home. Hopefully the franchise sticks to this new direction. Its just a shame they had to discover it in the last film for some key actors/characters.",1
254,"Very good movie, but, seriously, I cannot rate this high. I just cant - I cant see Wolverine being brought to THIS - weak and depressed. I remember those X-man movies of young and powerful Hugh Jackman - how I liked it. And now what we can see here - old and weak ex-superhero. Man, despite the movie itself is great I really dislike when you force us to see our lovely heroes to die.",1
256,"The most brutal superhero movie that I ever seen, Logan has a rawness that you can't witness in any film in genre, what is the same time paradoxical for a genre that approach supernatural events. Brutal in several points, characters for example are very well developed, principally Logan, that is a genuine antihero here, being as evil as good in dosed measures and in certain moments. For whom used to complain weakness for Fox's superhero movies, Logan is simply a relief and a joy.",1
257,"La mejor película de la saga de Lobezno. La ambientación triste y demacrada la logran perfectamente y el final te saca unas lagrimas. (Spoiler) Quieras o no, que mueran unos de los personajes más históricos de la saca x-men toca la patata.",1
258,Logan is a  unique superhero movie that doesn't set up  future instalments to its benefit all while  Playing out family drama and the kind of savage wolverine we have wanted to see on the big screen for years Hugh jackman is amazing and make every minute of his final outing of this much loved character count,1
259,"First off, this is NOT your average PG-13 superhero movies. There are intense violent moments of dismemberment, harsh language, and dark subjects. I highly recommend not taking any children to see this.The actual movie is amazing! Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart really nails their performance as aged Wolverine and Prof. X. You can feel them trying to cope with what they have become. The girl who acted as Laura did an amazing job as well. She stays silent through most of the movie, but her expression alone is enough to tell the story. The whole movie itself does a great job of ""the end of the mutants"" feeling. Definitely a must-see movie, just not for kids",1
260,"Logan is the big farewell to Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and the character of Wolverine. The film moves, but at the same time it is a bit strong because of the amount of violence it has, so it achieves an excellent balance between the two. The action scenes are impressive, the performances are excellent (the chemistry between Stewart and Jackman is intact and an excellent performance by Dafne Keen that for most of the film transmits all the feelings of his character with only looks), the characters are already endearing and here you suffer everything you suffer, the comic moments come well and the dramatic moments touch the viewer. An excellent and intimate movie of the character.",1
262,The cinematography in this movie is excellent. Scenes like the professor at the casino are really picturesque. The kids fighting at the end of the film is riveting.,1
263,"Yet an other example of maturity coming to the rescue when it comes to super hero films, Logan represents a sober approach to the X-Men mythos that, due to its violent nature and well-developed characters can move you in ways many other movies of the sort can't. No jokes, no over the top heroics, this is a film more about decay and goodbyes.",1
264,"A very awesome and violent action Super hero movie that has great story telling. Rated-R and it caters to the adults rather than 9 year olds, unlike Endgame and Infinity War. Swearing,  Drinking, Blood, etc. Simple things missing from those films. (Well of course not always drinking)",1
265,"Logan is a revelation from Marvel's PG13 Avengers cancer meta. The R rated (but really NC-17) Action is fantastic.The Performance are great through the board, I disliked Boyd Holbrook in Narcos but he's perfect in here, the girl has a lot of potential and even Stephen Merchant is a pleasant surprise. The humor works in the right spots and the sentimental moments never linger too long, they're always timed right and know when to move on.The few things that keep Logan from being perfect are a handful of cheap looking cgi moments and some lazy script writing.In the end is Logan one of the best films I've seen in the last couple of years",1
267,The Logan movie provides a great send off for Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine while also providing a movie with emotional depth. The movie changes the stereotypical formula usually associated with superhero movies and benefits greatly from it. A definite must see for any movie lover.,1
268,"Hugh Jackman is at his peak when performing in the movie ""Logan"". I've never seen the Wolverine stoop to levels within this movie and wanted more after the two hours and twenty minutes concluded. I believe it is one of the best superhero movies to date and deserves all the love people give it.",1
269,"Fantastic movie. I was interested to see this movie after I learned that Jackman took a pay-cut to get a R rating. So I anticipated great action. I was however, pleasantly surprised about how emotionally gripping this movie came out to be. No other superhero movies kept me this emotionally engaged. Quite frankly, this felt like an Oscar worthy movie to me. The acting and directing was brilliant. If there is an award for the most improved sequel than this movie is the clear winner.",1
270,"An unbelievable movie, going in watching 1 fantastic trailer months before. I knew it couldn't disappoint not even in the slightest. Perfect blend with loss, wandering in darkness, and getting light with a new supporting character. Such similarities between the final story of the X-Men but solely with the 2 finishing men who knew everything in life as someone different till the very end, Logan/Wolverine and Charles Xavier. The Last of Us helped me understand the bringing of the man who knew the biggest pain and the following of a young girl with things extraordinarily similar.",1
271,Hugh gives his best performance as Wolverine in this amazing superhero drama! Logan is one of the best films of the year and it's one of the best superhero film ever. It's one of the only superhero films that feels like real life!,1
272,"This is it, after 17 years we finally get the wolverine film we have been waiting for. Logan is a harrowing yet beautiful end to to these characters the we have following since they first appeared in the first X-Men film back in 2001. When I saw the first trailer for Logan, I didn't really understand what was happening, so I watched it over and over again, and after a dozen viewings, I suddenly understood what was about to come, yet I still had many theories and many questions. Logan is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant, Richard E. Grant, and Dafne Keen. In a time when mutants are almost completely non existent (Almost) and the only one who are left are forced to flee and hide from society because they are being hunted. Logan, Xavier, and Caliban are hiding in an abandoned plant in Mexico. I will say this, if there is anyone in this film that screams Oscar worthy, it's Hugh Jackman, and Patrick Stewart, these two actors have done more than just earned the right to be nominated, they deserve to be nominated. They have dedicated a good chunk of their careers into these characters, you couldn't ask for anything better. Watching this film is a rather unusual experience if you didn't see the 2 previous X-Men films, even if you watch them, the experience is still unusual. It seems the closer the MCU gets to Infinity War, the more emotionally deep comic book films get. This film is also rated R, and DAMN, it really earns that R rating, it's bloody, it's gory, it's dark and brooding, yet oddly satisfying and relieving. From the very beginning it's pretty obvious that there is no hope left for these characters, they have finally reached the end of their road, and they are tired, they are torn both physically and mentally and they just want the suffering to end, which leads me to the deaths of both Logan and Xavier. When Xavier dies at the hands of X-24 (Logan's Perfect clone of himself) my heart shattered into a million pieces, I thought he deserved better than that, but it felt appropriate for the situation at hand. I cried for a few minutes, and knew that in order for it to get better, it must get worse first, which it did. When it came to Logan's death, I knew it was coming, one way or another, and when it came to that moment after Logan killed X-24, I knew it was time. At the moment he died, I cried once more, but was glad that Logan felt love one last time, just a little glimmer of it, and then he was gone. I know this review looks like a personal summary of the film, because that's exactly what it is, I didn't know any other way to review it by telling everyone how it felt on an emotional level, I saw this film back in March when it came out, and 8 months later, it still hurts. Now I'll talk about everything else. The visual effects where amazing from the brutally blood and gory moments where Logan and X-23 (Logan's Daughter/Clone) are slashing of limbs and decapitating really unlucky people, it's shockingly amazing. I have to give big credit to the score by Marco Beltrami, it really felt like it didn't belong in a comic book movie, at certain times it was breathtaking, intense, depressing, even frightening, I definitely do think the score is Oscar worthy. The cinematography is another Oscar worthy part of this film, yes this is a Marvel comics movie with a few Marvel characters, but it didn't feel like a comic book movie, it felt more like a modern western mixed with drama, and a lot of action, it's like what The Dark Knight did when that didn't feel like a comic book film, it pushed the boundaries of these film can accomplish by pushing the genre to a whole new level, and that's exactly what Logan has done. Logan is the perfect example of a film that can really change a certain film genre, in a sense it's revolutionary, it's an accomplishment that is hard to muster but easy to screw up, but here it is done remarkably well. I really hope that for a while now, like at least a few years before any word about Wolverine coming back to life doesn't happen because this character needs to rest, he's been through a lot. Like everyone has been saying, this is Hugh Jackman's swan song as the Wolverine, and I will always be fan of Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine, and I will be hesitant when someone else take charge of this character, but Hugh Jackman will forever and always be The Wolverine.",1
273,"Concluding & Acerbic Contemplation For Marvel Comics' Fictional SuperheroWeapon X, one of the most beloved characters that Marvel has brought to cinema screens, has departed, but he has made it in style, with scarlet blood dripping down his defective adamantium claws and leaving a feasible regeneration based on young mutants in the bequest. After insistent and suggestive promises of director James Mangold, which were disclosed while he filmed the notorious movie, ""Logan"" has finally landed in worldwide cinemas and we have had the opportunity to refute or asseverate whether or not the words of the scholar Marvel-fan were right. In general terms, the utopian western that Mangold has raised is the definitive entry point to out-of-the- ordinary facets in the genre, for the true meaning of adapting works with abidance. This installment will cause us to apply Plato's Allegory of the Cave to UCM in all its splendor, dusting off the glorious, intelligent, capable and above all human superhero movies.Jackman shows us his alter ego drastically unrecognizable: ill, faint and about to collapse. Australian actor gives everything in order to offer a proper last goodbye his professional epithet, he provides it tangible malady and visible fatigue along capacities, his sad gaze captures hopelessness; this man's actions will annoy to ethical heroes world and yes, what Mangold declared has a voracious source: ""It's not a superhero movie, it's a film about humans with powers"". Hugh offers a properly successor, she's Dafne Keen, newcomer actress who plays Laura, an overfilled with anger and vigor girl, with the potential required to carry upon her shoulder weapon X responsibilities. Wolverine's last adventure as an irrevocable spaghetti western is unthinkable, a feature-film with a dirty and stylized artistic expression and seemingly devoid of moral characters, rough and badass guys. Here, the action sequences are justified, calculated and incredibly ferocious. Officially, this is the movie adapting Wolvie's pages in form and essence, it doesn't display super bright battles or with light sparks instead of blood, violence has a reason and aftermaths; and although the application is concise, they stir more than Avengers' pompous fights. The signs of summer movie are almost microscopic; the pictures are dry, pessimistic, melancholic and without a doubt, selected components can be compared with ""Midnight Special"" by Jeff Nichols. All this lack of hope is embellished with a sudden parsimonious pace, aggressive when it has to be, but intelligent in emotions posed. Marco Beltrami's music squeezes every means at its disposal, however, paradoxically, calm and sad melodies excel, they capture the atmosphere of the film.And emotional field matters. Sentimentality is suitable in each character, sensations are plausible and touch even the most disheartened person. It differs from sporadic determinations, incomprehensible twists, every act is motivated by a thought supported by feelings. Each of these mutant beings has a well-crafted conclusion, both expected and completely unpredictable endings. In fact, there's something sad about the movie: this one feels like by far the best Wolvie's story, making us reflect how other adventures would have been without MPAA restrictions. Must ""Logan"" thank ""Deadpool""? It's all in how you look at it, since even though Wade Wilson's feature film has explicit contents, everything tends to the wit, while nuance is different here, and exactly that's what disquieted 20th Century Fox, the change has an abrupt alteration in pace with respect to the preceding film, however, they can breathe easier now, money continues coming in.""Logan"" says goodbye categorically to Bryan Singer's and Mangold's adaptations and takes delighted Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy aura thanks to its realistic and pessimistic way, a desolate horizon where the hero isn't super, is a hero facing human issues. The second R-rated Marvel film cements ambitions in the tone, script and performances, portraying fully both the fictional world of the pages as the mortal world, our world which can transmute in the twinkling of an eye, there's a dry and overwhelming realism to our uncertain evolution. A violent, clever and eloquent motion picture; Jackman's final performance gives an unprecedented Wolverine impression so far and offers an open-minded look at the superhero universe, also serves as confirmation that Marvel can get to be as melodramatic and dark as DC films without losing the skills, without losing the touch. A round of applause for Hugh Jackman, who says ""never again"" to Wolvie's suit, however, economic Hollywood can get it. Thank you for everything and good way. X",1
274,"This review contains spoilers. Last year’s Deadpool movie proved there is a market for more adult orientated and violent comic book movies and Logan backs that up with a movie that ranks amongst the best Marvel Studios have created. Set in the near future, in which mutants are no longer born, Logan (aka Wolverine) is driving a limousine for a living whilst caring for an ailing Charles Xavier. When he is contacted by a woman caring for a young girl, that she claims is her daughter, Logan and Xavier are forced out of hiding to in order to help.Logan has is as much a western or a road as it is a superhero film and this really helps set it apart from what has started to become a slightly over-familiar structure for Marvel films. This approach also carries over into the action/fight scenes that, as well as being more bloody and brutal than you’ll see in other Marvel movies, rely less on CGI and are all the more effective for it. Hugh Jackman is as good as ever as Wolverine and the on screen chemistry between him, Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Laura (the superb Dafne Keen) really helps give the movie a further edge by making it easy to actually care about what happens to these characters. If this is to be Jackman’s last appearance as Wolverine he’s certainly gone out on a high note.",1
275,"One of the best superhero films I've ever seen, An incredible send off for Hugh Jackman's final portrayal of this iconic character, You will be missed as Wolverine :(. The movie totally deserved it's r rating, not because of the violence and language because of it's story... a sad dramatic one. 10/10",1
276,With the way Xmen and Marvel movies have been going I wasn't exactly looking forward to this movie. But I was pleasantly surprised and I actually regret judging it by its previous titles. The movie in my opinion was the best xmen movie to date.,1
277,"An Oscar-worthy performance by Hugh Jackman, great performances by Patrick Stewart & Dafne Keen, satisfying villains, a gripping plot, brutal action and hard-hitting emotional moments - all of those components not only make ""Logan"" one of the best, if not THE best superhero movie ever made, but also quite possibly a future classic in cinema as a whole.",1
278,"Is it a dark movie? NoIs it a brutal gore movie? Not reallyIs it hardcore R movie? NoThis is what makes Logan great, it's not a brutal violent emo dark story for the sake of R rating. It's a sober, violent and non glamorous movie about a man. Because finally we don't have Wolverine, we have Logan.",1
279,"The best superhero movie of this decade. With incredible acting, dark but nessacary action and incredible emotional impacts, what is there not to like about this film? The outstanding script is what drives this movie forward and the special effects are so realistic you sometimes forget they're even there. What a send off for Hugh Jackman's wolverine.",1
280,"Acting: 7,5Screenplay: 6,5Ending: 7I do not like comics and movies about them. But the Wolverine, thanks to the strong acting of Hugh Jackman & Patrick Stewart, sinks into the soul.",1
281,"I've never really been a fan of the X-Men franchise nor its characters but when I heard that this will be Hugh Jackman's last main film portrayal of Wolverine, I had to give it a shot. I've only ever had a brief understanding of who he is and what he's all about. Thanks to its R-Rated approval rating, it allowed me to really understand how Wolverine truly interacts with everything and I bet the team behind the film were just as thankful too. It seemed like it allowed them to explore and push boundaries, fiddling with levels of creativity to really force the audience to properly immerse themselves in this jam-packed thriller.All I'm going to say is that I got goosebumps several times. That's what makes a fantastic film - the fact that it was the final nail in the coffin only cements its place as surely one of the best Wolverine films ever. I think the fact my inherent, slight distaste of the Wolverine character myself prevents me from realising that it was a masterclass of a film. It's a darn shame I can't absolutely love the film when I don't love the character itself.",1
282,"One of the best X-Men universe movies by far. Best Wolverine movie to date.  Think of this movie as an old school western but for modern times set in the Marvel Universe. It does stray from the comic but overall this movie is very well done. Go see the movie.  I cant write anymore without spoiling anything but this is a great movie even though its from ""Fox"" and they have a reputation of making some bad X-men movies.",1
283,"I've been wanting to see this in the few weeks and yes it is quite good but what I am not expecting is I've had a reaction to Deadpool appearing in the opening but that wasn't the case of it. I was expecting to see a 20th Century Fox logo at the beginning, but no, it's just the trailer of the new Deadpool movie coming out next year. It's not the opening scene where you can see the Deadpool character, it's just the trailer. I have seen the film, Deadpool but I wasn't expecting to see him breaking the fourth wall. OK, I know you're thinking I'm going off track of this review but that's just the thought on the opening before the film is starting. Logan is a film released this year 2017 before the live-action Beauty and the Beast. Me and Dad had been watching last week on Saturday and yes, I wasn't expecting to see Deadpool at the beginning (which is a trailer new film coming out next year) before the 20th Century Fox logo is coming. I just hope the Marvel logo in the recent films and films next year would stay in the very beginning just like all studio logos did. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart reprised their roles one last time in the most recent film of the X-Men franchise because this is the last film that Hugh Jackman playing Logan as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. Hugh Jackman's performance is fantastic, Patrick Stewart's character is in the wheelchair and this kid I don't know who she is and I've never seen her before in my life and also Stephen Merchant is in this. I actually liked this film despite it's violence with blood and guts which is unexpected for an X-Men. Actually liked it so did my Dad and was left blown away by it. I was telling my Dad that why does it have blood and huts when all the other X-Men films didn't and he says ''Well, it's because the filmmakers wanted to make something different and making it 18, 15 and 12 and rated PG, PG-13 and R making it for kids and adults especially teenagers.'' I know that this movie is going to be rated R at first before the film is released. When we're watching it I was thinking to myself ''this doesn't even seem like an X-Men movie.'' With this movie it is something that people watch and they and I didn't expect to see which direction is going. I know about the plot twists and I think this film is absolutely fantastic. And I guess this is the last X-Men film to be made and of course Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are their last roles and I still haven't seen the new X-Men films, X-Men: First Class, The Wolverine, X-Men: Days of Future Past and X-Men: Apocalypse and yes I have seen the old one's and I think this is the only R rated movie I've ever watched in cinema's. What a tremendous superhero action movie! Congratulations!",1
284,"Logan has set the standard of where X-Men movies should be heading. It's great to have fun and superpowers, but a solid storyline and excellent performances far outweighs those themes.",1
285,"Esperó que reciba los Oscar que se merece este excelente peliculón, me encanto de principio a fin y es lo más épico que se ha visto de este personaje.",1
286,"Logan is a good superhero movie and a good drama movie that ironically is less than the sum of its parts. There are some awesome superhero fight scenes that benefit greatly from the R rating, and the drama is able to evoke real emotions in the viewer. The problem is that there aren't enough superhero parts to make a good superhero movie, and the weak plot and villain motivations undercut the movie as a drama. Logan could easily be a 9+ movie with the benefit of some addition by subtraction by improving the pacing with tighter editing. Even without that Logan is well worth the watch at a solid 8.",1

288,"Intense, sad, emotional, sometimes charming, although the plot maybe thin and simple but may be forgiven by it's characaters and the atmospheric feel.Logan is a very well directed film and a perfect good bye to it's old running actors of the X-MEN franchise.",1
289,"Logan is not a typical superhero movie. It's a film that reminded me of the videogame The Last of Us, with just a few superpowered people happening to be present in it.In a world where mutants have almost gone extinct, Wolverine is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning, while hiding along with Charles Xavier who is dying of old age, complete with Alzheimer's disease. Wolverine works as a driver and makes money so that he and Xavier can retire. One day they encounter a young girl who turns out to be Laura aka X-23, and Wolverine has to protect her. There is plenty of brutal violence, but also many really emotional and touching scenes.In Logan there is no heroic struggle like in other superhero movies. Wolverine isn't trying to save the world, nor does he battle the evil forces of Magneto or some other supervillain. It's just the story of two old men wanting to peacefully retire, but one of them has to also protect his cloned daughter from her pursuers.This being Hugh Jackman's swansong in the role of Wolverine, Logan is a great movie. It can easily be watched even by people who haven't experienced any previous X-Men or generally superhero movie. Too bad we won't see Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds starring in a proper X-Men movie as Wolverine and Deadpool respectively, after that horrible X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie.",1
290,"Logan is an incredible film, not just as an x-men film but as an emotional standpoint for the final wolverine film, everything is handled too an extent to where everything including the death of Logan is incredibly emotional",1
291,"Admittedly I have only ever seen X-Men 1 and Wolverine out of the countless entries - but this caught my eye as something different. A lot darker, swearier and quite violent but it actually works. It felt like an X-Men movie for adults, and I think this is pretty much how you sum it up. Logan's story has been a long one I think he finally deserves his rest.",1
292,I loved this movie! I thought the whole thing was just amazing it was definitely the best of the Wolverine solo films because even though Origins and The Wolverine were okay they didn't have the same amazing feeling to them that this one had. It was definitely worth my time and money to see in theatres,1
293,"Logan, to put it simply, was a fantastic movie. The reason it succeeded so much was because it was grounded. It kept us with the characters and we were able to relate to the characters despite the superhero background.All of the actors were impressive, and Jackman was impressive as always. I loved X-23, she was hilarious and badass at the same time.The action scenes were very impressive as well. There wasn't major CGI or special effects, but they were very well directed and exciting.Overall I would say that this was a fantastic movie. It was emotional, exciting and at times terrifying. I would recommend it to pretty much anybody.",1
294,bloody emotional..... but hell I want Wolverine back!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,1
295,"In the near future, a weary Logan (Hugh Jackman) cares for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart) in a hide-out on the Mexican border. But his attempts to hide from the world and legacy are up-ended when a young mutant (Dafne Keen) arrives, being pursued by dark forces.Hell yeah! Finally a mainstream superhero movie for those who don't really care about superheroes, or have grown tired of all the cliches of the genre.It's got R-rated action, it's got characters with some depth and also memorable acting, it's got heart. It still is not deep enough to be compared to the quality superhero TV series, of which there are many. And it loses some of its dramatic heft near the end due to lack of variety (not enough different stuff happening, the same type of events are always recurring). But all in all, the movie's good, and worth the hype it's gained.This is the last time we got to see Hugh Jackman as Wolverine... unless he changes his mind, of course.Also stars Boyd Holbrook, Richard E. Grant, Stephen Merchant, Eriq La Salle and Elizabeth Rodriguez.",1
296,"This is a great showing that comic book movies can be great movies without needing to add ""for a comic book movie"". No matter if you like comics or not, this is a great dramatic movie, with excellent acting, action that truly justifies the R rating, and clearly represents what Wolverine is all about, and a great connections between the characters, from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart excellent relationship on screen, to newcomers Dafne Keen's showstealing's performance. This is truly the finest Wolverine movie (not that it's a tough race) and up there for the best X-men movie and even comic book based movie. Super recommended.",1
298,"Logan achieves what Warner Brother's The Dark Knight did in creating a superhero film hidden within another genre, in this case the modern western. Logan's atmosphere is both gritty and dark, though provides reasoning for its mood. The cast is all brilliant, especially Hugh Jackman in the titular character. The action scenes are superb, bloody and all, and a real sense of thrill and importance. The only personal crutch for me was the lack of clear development of the villian(s), yet the great storytelling of the protagonists makes up the these issues. Logan is easily on of the best superhero films ever, and possibly one of the best films of the year.",1
299,"If you think, that MCU’s started quiet a long time ago, think again and look at Hugh Jackman, who’s been playing Wolverine for more than 17 years – symbolic that his character’s more than hundred years old. But this long run’s come to an end, but what kind of it? The end we all dreamed of – brutal and enjoyable franchise’s epilogue with both dramatically and action satisfaction. Hugh Jackman’s brilliant smile has passed away, Logan’s grown some hairs and accepted hobo-style look – in the world of familiar comic book adaptations, such approach is really welcomed, especially in Wolverine’s case, who’s iconic and original image of severe killer was long-awaited by the fans and average viewers. Costumes and shining setting are gone, substituted by dystopic and urban landscapes, which’re perfectly matches title character’s inner world – broken and hopeless. Frankly, dark tone makes old and new heroes or villains look more mature and conversations between Stewart’s and Jackman’s aged Professor Xavier and Logan come to a new level from just professional to more family-style. Of course, it’s more because of wow-effect from new conception either from real franchise drama-development, but still it’s really cool. Especially, considering the fact that actors give fine performances of their characters, especially Boyd Holbrook, whose vicious Donald Pierce is the best villain in years. Even Dafni Keen’s character isn’t annoying at all, as it may concern previously. She’ isn’t much talking anyway, what’s a really smart move from creators.  Director James Mangold’ new entry in comic genre includes high-stakes filming and the viewers are also now more demanding here and although he’s made a great job in style and concept, scenario has some significant flows. Yes, we have a minimum world description for comfort viewing, which includes automatic wagons and some new technologies descriptions, but the story background lacks of information – Mangolg gives only glimpses of what happened, why and how characters ended like this. This may upset some hardcore fans as well as universe development’s pretty weak with the feeling that film in every way tries to stay from X-Men franchise. However, the real concern about director’s work is movie’s rough final act – after emotional and thoughtful main part ending feels like directorproducer came out on the stage and said “we run out of time/budget and have to end this drama with typical superhero sequence”. Make no mistake, it’s not as bad as you may think, the problem isn’t so big, as it was in previous Wolvie movie, where after well-done narration has come a silly finale, but still it’s a bit upsetting. But nevetheless, even considering this issues “Logan” is a great story with complex characters and may be ranked as step forward for comic book movies with the chance, that in future we will get more adult-style adaptations with both satisfying dramatic and action features.   “Logan” is barely can be named as a revolution in genre, but it’s a great example of a thoughtful storytelling combined with terrifying action-sequences - script issues can be easily forgiven, given the fact, that the major part is really great and now we can peacefully let go the classical character.",1
300,"Logan is great, it's the most mature and competent movie from the X-men universe, as someone who doesn't like the other x-men films, this was a huge improvement.The story was great, great drama, interesting ideas and concepts...even if I didn't like the last 30 minutes, the ending was great, it was emotional and I got a teary-eye but the last third of this movie took a lot of the charm of the story for me.But apart from that, the story was solid enough to keep me invested.The characters were great, I never liked Wolverine but he's fantastic in this film, I really felt bad for him and he has great developpement. Xavier was my favorite character, he had his comedic moments but you feel so sorry for him and once you understand what happend to him and what he did, it honestly made me care for his character and the other characters were really good too... exept for the villain, it seems to be that it's very hard to make a good and memorable villain in super-hero films because I've never seen a good one (exept for dark knight), he was the weakest character and the weakest element in the film, it reminded me why I disliked the other X-men films so much, he's just another boring scientist...The action scenes are really well made, this is the most violent x-men film I've seen and the brutal scenes are really satisfying to watch (sometimes hard to watch).So even if it's not perfect, I do believe that Logan was a success, it has a great story, a great narrative and a fantastic emotional payoff, if you don't like super-hero films or X-men films, I would still recommend it.",1
302,"LoganLe dernier Rôle de Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) et Patrick Stewart (Professeur X). Une fin pertinente, belle et artistiquement superbe.En allant voir un film de super Héros, je ne pensai pas voir ce résultat propre et plein d'affects (émotions).Un film tourné dans un monde situé en 2029. Un film sur une ""Bête"" fatiguée, meurtri, n'étant plus que l'ombre de lui-même et ne croyant plus à ce que peut offrir la vie.

Dans ses carnages fracassants, on peut y apercevoir l'étrange symétrie de l'ours, la chaine alimentaire....Ce film est un hommage à wolverine et Proffesseur X. Il dissimule dans les différents plans de cette clôture mythique de nombreux clins d'oeil, cameo et Easter Eggs.De jolie mélodie au piano qui rende mécolique cette poursuite éprouvante.Visuellement travaillée.Entaché par quelques défauts-Un son dolby Atmos décevant.

303,"Hugh and Patrick last time on the x-men, the movie is not just those typical superhero saving the world at the end with happy a ending, this more different, it's more like a deep and serious, and emotional movie that it's trying to show the human and the deep side of an old hero that loose many of the people he care about, many superheroes movies doesn't do like this emotional. Great job Fox.",1
304,"Hugh Jackman's last hurrah as Wolverine is good enough, but it's nothing special. I wanted greatness, but what I got was a solid x-men film. I'm happy enough with that. You don't get many of those anymore.",1
305,its am impact film that hits you hard from the beginning its a thrilling character driven study that gives an analysis on the fall of greatness its a fantastic film that will leave a legacy for the character,1
306,"Hugh Jackman Wolverine karakterine mükemmel bir şekilde veda etmiş. Aynı şekilde Profesörde öyleydi ikisinin oyunculuğu karakterlere yakışan, çok iyi performanslardı. Dafne Keen muhteşemdi gerçekten büyüledi, bu yaşta böyle bir performans inanılmaz. Oyunculuklar olarak çok iyi bir filmdi, duygusallığı çok iyi veren bir film olmuş. Fakat filmde eksik yerler var gibiydi, izlerken işte başlıyoruz dedim ve yine olmadı. O konuda biraz bana kendini sevdiremedi, tamamen duygusallığa ve karakter vedalarına odaklanmışlar. İzlerken sıkılmadım fakat büyük bir beklentiyle gittiğim için istediğimi de pek alamadım. Yine de öyle kötü veya ortalama bir film değil. İyi bir filmdi.",1
307,"I really love the movie, the story line is good, the action in the movie is great and there is humor in it! All of this makes a great movie out of it, I enjoyed every second of it. It is a sad goodbye though..",1
308,"Holy **** that was AMAZING. It's been a while since I've seen such a great superhero movie (does it even still count as one?). The acting, cinematography, story, fighting scenes - it all made a fantastic mix of action movie and a great drama. And the ending man, oh my god, I still can't gather myself up. Maybe in some parts it was a bit too long, but hey - thanks to that you can watch Hugh Jackman's and Dafne Keen's acting a couple of minutes longer.",1
310,"A wonderful end to two great actors, and one great x men, wolverine, who was done justice in this Logan film.A film that leaves one hollow with sadness at the end is worthy of anyone time and worthy to be called one of heroes best films.it diverts from all out action, showcasing the lives of the ones we want to dawn capes of and be like.",1
311,"Awesome movie, music performance, everything is good.You can see the evolution of the characters from the beginning when he told her to **** her, and the moment she calls him dad. The characters are awesome and despite some jokes the movie keeps you in tension at all times",1
312,"Everyone should go and see this movie. It's moving, has action, has nostalgia, great soundtrack, awesome but not exaggerated effects. A must. Thanks Logan for all that great work over the years. It pays respect to the beloved character from the comic books, get's finally rid of the childish boundaries and closes a brilliant career.",1
313,"The best movie after The Dark Knight in this genre.It is certainly better than any other superhero/sci-fi/X-men movie.This movie shows us vulnerability of the supeheroes that we have loved for so many years in a very heart wrenching way.Hugh Jackman's greatest performance ,hats off to him. The best actor for me for my whole life.He should get an Oscar for this beautiful film. Made me cry.One should catch it in theatres",1
314,"This is a wonderful film. Probably even among the best comic book movies (maybe not better than Nolan's Batman). Quality drama mixed with amazing action. Thanks to R, the action is really fun to watch. All the actors play their roles wonderfully! Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are excellent actors! Feel the connection between them. Dafne Keen is just gorgeous! Did not expect such acting from the little girl. It actually looks like a small, vicious animal. The plot of this film is simple, but the main thing is the interaction between the characters, and situations during the journey. At the end of the film I was trying not to cry. But not even because of what happened with Wolverine, and due to the fact that Hugh Jackman will not return to this role. I'm a his big fan, all 17 years I watching him in this role, and I can't imagine someone else. It's the best film of X-Men. Now waiting for the movie about X-23.",1
315,"It is a good try to make a comic book movie relevant to non-comic book fans. I enjoyed the performance by Hugh Jackman; he looks particular bad ass as an old, muscular man.",1
316,"This movie was what Wolverine fans have been waiting for. The R rating makes it so we can see the more violent and angry side of Logan, as well get a realistic feel of what the world would be like without mutants. I would reccomend seeing this at least twice because you really get the raw emotion and melancholy feel the second time you watch it.",1
317,"This movie is pretty unrelenting in its bleakness and horror, but it bring to light a new side of Wolverine and the struggles of a long life. The action scenes are superb and it certainly earns its R rating right from the get go. I think First Class may be my favorite of the X-Men film, in part because it felt like something new and changed the game for the franchise. Logan feels less like a game-changer and more like a game-ender and is the perfect sendoff for Jackman and Stewart. I can't imagine how X-men will follow this up, but I'm eager to see if they can build on the breath of fresh air this gave them.10/10",1
318,"This is what Wolverine should have been since the beginning, very gritty, action packed and with real stakes at risk, is a great personal journey for this characters, showing that heroes are not spot perfect, justice driven poster boys and girls, they are real people, imperfect and troubled but that even among that,  they decide to do something about all the bad things around them.Excellent photography, AMAZING performance by the actors and good pacing,  is a must for any superhero fans and ultimately anyone who enjoy a good story :)   FOX, keep on this track!",1
319,"Intense, anguish, brutal neowestern-type story with devastating atmosphere. Fully engaging flawlessly performed.BUTThere are too much cliches and all this kind of hollywood stupidities to call it a masterpiece. Take a stormstrooper's syndrome of gunmen, take a ""train saving from chase"" cliche, take this theatrical death speech cliche, take the weird video of supersecret laboratory where you can easily shoot everything with your smartphone. Too much of such displeasing features. That's why not perfect but still good.",1
320,"A fitting farewell to an iconic character, with terrific performances from Jackman and Stewart plus spectacular action scenes. You may find yourself unexpectedly emotional by the end as well, which makes this the best kind of action movie: one with thrills and heart.",1
321,"The biggest take away I got from this movie is that I could have waited for it to come out on DVD.  It wasn't a movie I needed to see in a theater.  There weren't any big special effects that warranted the huge screen.  I enjoyed the film in the sense that I always love watching Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and I felt this was a must see even though I knew how it would ultimately end.  It's a ""smaller"" film with a more dramatic bent than other X-men films.  Action scenes were violent but rather unoriginal.  And ultimately, it would not be a movie that I would re-watch again and again.",1
322,This pivotal film portays Hugh jackman and Logan's last days specifically coupled with the new young blooded Dafne Keen's X-23 or Laura this film is unlike any superhero film or action for that matter ever made in history with the last of Us/Western tone and direction Its hard not love Dafne and Hugh in this film the acting is quite inspiring and the stupidly talented dafne doesn't step down ever.the direction is ultimately amazing gives you everything you want and half of the time everything you dont. A truly untainted film by tropes or cliche's a realistic film.And as I thought is the top 5 greatest superhero flick.,1
323,"Finally, the Wolverine movie we were waiting for. This movie delivered what the other X-men movies were holding back from us. The brutality and ferociousness of Wolverine is brought to us in spades by not only Logan himself but by Laura/X-23. These two, along with professor Xavier, deliver an on screen chemistry that seems organic. The action is well choreographed and brutal, living up to the R rating. Don't expect this movie to be simply action. You can expect a lot of laughs, both intentional and unintentional, and loads of heart string tugging moments. Overall this movie delivers to both fans an newcomers. There isn't an instance in which you will be bored.",1
324,"This movie is amazing. If you like superhero movies, or westerns, or bonding movies, or road trip films, this movie's for you. Incredible acting, score, and writing, this is an easy 10/10. There is a tiny shift of tone that you may dislike, but this movie is worth watching either way.",1
326,"The movie antagonist is not good enough, either secondary characters. Logan and Prof. X had the nostalgia factor which is good ,& X23 is a big surprise, awesome acting by her. Dramatic scenes are not that deep, I did not feel moved by some of them (except the finale). Overall this movie is a good way to end Logan's long journey.",1
327,"I believe that movies are important.  Entertainment, sure.  Inspirations?  Of course.  Lessons learned?  Absolutely.  Logan moves along well enough.  Superhero movies ARE.  I spent fifteen buck on popcorn alone watching this in a theatre, and didn't want my money back.  However, I recommend only that the viewer rent this movie at redbox for $1.60.  Then I can be jealous of you, for the value.  The director and the film editor here deserves credit for the pacing and sustained level of tension and thrills.  The new face of the young female lead adds a freshness long overdue in this genre.  Feel safe and gather your family and friends for a movie night where fun on the couch is the point.",1
328,"In a time when Marvel continues to churn out the same superhero film time- and-time again ('Deadpool' and 'Guardians' aside due to their fresh take on the genre), it's refreshing when something as intricate and beautifully- executed as 'Logan' is made, and on the extremely rare occasion I have given a superhero film a ""masterpiece"" rating. I mean let's face it, that first trailer was a dead giveaway of how damn good it was going to be.I understand that Marvel has made the attempt to build characters through a series of films previously, such as they have tried with the Avengers films, but never have I seen a film that treats character development as seriously, and pulls it off with such precision, as they did here in 'Logan', a film that focuses more on the ""humane"" aspect of the character and how vulnerable he is as a superhero, instead of the over-the-top execution that's usually featured ('X- Men Origins' I'm looking at you).Two characters that we've come to know and love, James ""Wolverine"" Howlett (aka Logan) and Charles ""Professor X"" Xavier, are put to the test of time as we see them in their new state, once characters that resembled strength and power, are now withering and vulnerable. And the gut-punching, adrenaline- pumping action has been swapped out for slow-moving, emotional drama and character development. Does it work? You bet! From start to finish we are led on a journey of discovery and empathy, with James Mangold more than making up for his previous effort that is 'The Wolverine'.I think it's the uncertainty throughout that gives the film that powerful punch. In the other X-Men films (and most other Marvel films for that), we are faced with a plethora of superheroes each fighting a seemingly impossible army, but no matter what, there is always a general feeling that the good guys will win, and this usually happens. So when attending a superhero film, you sit back in ease, knowing the protagonists will succeed, however in 'Logan' that never happens, there is never that sense of safety, we can't be certain of their outcomes. Every step of the way, Wolverine looks tired, he looks sick, he's dying gradually, and due to his weakened form, we are left worrying for the character, there is that emotional attachment that most other superhero films lack. This is the harrowing truth throughout, we are emotionally-concerned from start to finish.With utterly stunning cinematography, a hard-hitting score, fantastic direction and a superhero performance that might just be the first Oscar- deserving one ever. Wolverine's outing makes for the best Marvel film to date, a gritty and vulnerable adventure into the vulnerability of superheroes.",1
329,"Best superhero movie i ever see. Great film, obviously  is the best marvel movie.Epic end of the Wolverine story, Hugh Jackman is the only one who  can be this character.",1
330,"excelente pelicula , me gustaron muchos los guiños y la lejanía que de algún modo se ve de las otras películas de x-men . Hugh hace un papel espectacular y despide su personaje a lo grande",1
331,"Logan is amazing in terms of acting, cinematography for the most part and writing, actually, it's the best I've seen in recent superhero movies. This is for me the second best X-Men movie only after First Class. I'm gonna miss Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine but this feels like another turn for the X-Men franchise and I actually kinda dig it.",1
332,this is not a Superhero movie ...... this is a very depressiv and brutal movie. I  wouls recommend this Movie to everyone who don't like normal marvel movies too .,1
333,"One of the best movie about superheroes I've ever seen. For sure ""Logan"" is the best movie about Wolverine. That's a beautiful finish of this character.",1
334,"The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.",1
335,WHATS UP YOU AMAZING PEOPLE! This is my Review for LOGANfirst up i would like to say that this movie for a lot of people other than me in the cinema this movie was emotional not gonna spoil anything but lets just say there are very sad and moments that feel amazing to watch for example this movie now acts like Deadpool by which i mean more blood action but more dark and gloomy than deadpool.This movie also reveals more to the X-Men Universe but not enough to the point that people on the internet have been making conspiracies already even after the first day of the movie being out.overall an amazing movie thanks for reading and check out my other reviews for Movies and my favourite subject VIDEO GAMES BBYYEE,1
336,Masterpiece Logan is by far one of the best superhero movies of all time and a satisfying goodbye to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.,1
337,One of the best movies I've seen lately.Dramatic as you would have imagined if you have red old man logan. I would classify it more as drama than action. Hugh Jackmans acting was awesome to the level it should get awarded(something that sadly never happens in action movies),1
338,"Loved this movie. Why? Finally, F*cking FINALLY I hear Logan cussing/swearing. (Seriously this deserves an 11 just to let Professor X swear!). Story telling of this movie is great; it had a great pace and you just felt the rawness of the situation. This female cried of course...can't help it, if you got kids crying, I will cry. LOLThis movie is made the way it should be -- the nitty and the gritty parts of Logan. Out of the 3 Wolverine movies, this one I loved the most. Damn if I didn't love the character. I am a huge Xmen comics fan (I'm sorry but while I enjoyed the Xmen movies, it was just bad) so actually finding an actor to portray Wolverine so perfectly...ugh it was everything (despite Jackman being pretty tall than the 5'3"" original).",1
339,"""Don’t be what they’ve made you""And like this we see the end of Wolverine and the start of the X-23. This is a movie that I feel you either love or hate, there's no inbetween. It had everything I always wanted in a X-Men movie. Best movie coming from Marvel, based on the fact Marvel has been failing a lot on good movies.",1
340,"After thinking about this film for quite some time after watching it. It did a leave a depressing after taste which I am not going to knock it for. In this world of high octane comic book films. It's good to see one that hasn't forgotten about the human side of the characters. The acting is incredible with Stewart and Jackman giving their swan song performance which no doubt will tug at the heart strings of long time fans. Dafne Keen is also great with her body language, conveying action and emotions throughout the first half of the film. I know this one film I will be definitely watching again.",1
341,"A pesar de que el argumento es prácticamente el mismo de todos los grandes blockbusters de Marvel (problema-personaje de cómic resolviéndolo-los malos son vencidos), aquí hay un espectáculo visual verdaderamente entretenido que echa mano de trucos sangrientos para lograr parecerse por momentos lo más posible a la esencia descarada de un cómic. Y no sólo trucos, este filme se pone aparte de la media que hemos recibido de los estudios Marvel por presentar un ritmo y personajes asombrosamente poderosos.",1
342,"The perfect ending for the 2000's x-men series. Said and depressing, but epic movie.",1
343,"Logan is filled with drama, action, and anything that is amazing from a marvel movie. Hugh Jackman played an old suffering man who could not see the brightness of life anymore. This is literally the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life, and i've seen the Godfather!",1
344,A new face for superhero movies stereotype can been seen by the brilliant work done here. In some moments the proposite loses herself just for more action scenes and fulfilled explosions however the intriguing drama catches your persona paternal feelings. Sometimes.,1
345,Efsane bir film aşırı sürükleyici hiçbir yerinde sıkmıyor içine çekiyor karakterlere dahada bağlandırıyor çoğu dandik marvel filmine benzemiyor kalite akıyor filmden çok iyiydi.,1
346,A spectacular ending to Wolverine. The R-rating allows this movie to go into deeper depths and there is something unusually interesting about watching such a great character go through what he does. It adds quite a bit of realism to the Marvel universe.,1
347,"James Mangold deviates from the superhero movie formula with Logan. The intense action sequences are well-balanced by the outstanding cast, brutal character development, and poignant script. A slip up or two in the script may hurt its score a bit, but overall, its a gritty tale that does its best to go miles beyond the standard superhero film.",1
348,"Simply put the best and most moving 'superhero' movie to date. It breaks the flashy and cliché mold often exhibited by Marvel's most noteworthy blockbusters. It is Marvel's 'The Dark Knight' but with more grit and emotion. Tremendously directed, scored, and acted. It may seem far fetched but the movie itself and its trio of Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and the incredibly talented newcomer Dafne Keen are all worthy of serious Oscar consideration. Unprecedented for any movie based on a comic book. This movie will always hold a special place in my heart, not only was it the perfect swan song to Hugh Jackman's tremendous run as Wolverine, but of the many movies I have had the pleasure of seeing this was the only one that successfully and shamelessly moved me to tears. With that, I highly encourage anyone and everyone to go see 'Logan' and it is unsurprisingly my favorite film of the year and my entire lifetime. I truly hope it breaks down the barrier and becomes the first comic book/superhero movie to garner a Best Picture nomination.",1
350,"After 17 years and 10 appearances Hugh Jackman and director James Mangold bring us the Wolverine movie we always wanted.Set in a run-down post-mutant future, Logan pitches itself as a character study of two former superheroes at the end of their rope.The legendary Wolverine is now a Las Vegas limo driver (a suitably sleazy profession for the film’s tone) scratching a living and doing his best to protect an ailing friend.Although the film takes some inspiration from the Frank Millar graphic novel Old Man Logan, it’s key point of difference is also it’s greatest strength i.e. the inclusion of Patrick Stewart’s Charles Xavier.Suffering from a degenerative brain disorder and struggling to retain his former self, this is a Professor X we have never seen before. At first this felt like a jarring shift for the character, especially given Charles’ new found foul mouth. As the story progresses though, the intricacies of Stewart's performance become clear and the true heartbreak of Xavier’s fate is felt. He has come a long way from the eloquent, sophisticated head-master of his School for the gifted, this is man who has lost himself.What makes this character arc great though, is that here, in this comic book movie, Xavier hasn’t been turned to the dark side by some demi-god or manipulated by some contrived plot (see Magneto in Apocalypse) instead he is an older man who is battling his own age and mortality. It’s a great example of the X-Men films doing what they do best — humanising these larger than life comic book characters and making them relatable.Despite this films title, for me the heart of Logan is Xavier and his relationship with those around him. He serves as father figure and continence to Logan throughout and anchors Hugh Jackman’s ageing hero.Re-watching the previous X-Men/ Wolverine films also brings a greater sense of depth to this central relationship. In Jackman and Mangold’s previous effort 2013’s The Wolverine, Logan is described as a Ronin — a samurai without a master. When viewing Logan’s journey as a whole (and this movie serves as a definitive end for this interpretation of the character) it becomes clear that Xavier is and always has been Logan’s ‘master’. Before he met Charles, Logan was lost (‘when I found you, you we’re making a living as a cage fighter') when Charles was no longer around (if we have to treat The Last Stand as something that happened) Logan became a reclusive outsider we saw at the beginning of The Wolverine.It is only when Charles is by his side that Logan has any sense of purpose and drive.As the plot of Logan kicks in to gear and the second act gets going the protagonists are introduced to a new young mutant — Laura (Dafne Keen).From there the film becomes a road movie of sorts as Laura is perused by a sinister organisation, hunted by Narcos alumni Boyd Holbrook as Pierce.Although Laura is the driving force of the film’s story, from a character point of view she serves a much greater purpose, although this doesn’t become clear until the third act which, of course I won’t spoil.As Logan and Charles are forced out of retirement we are treated to some spectacularly brutal action beats, the film fully embracing its ‘adult only' rating.What impressed me most about the film, but can also be seen as a flaw, is the remarkable restraint it showed in terms of being a blockbuster comic book movie.In press junkets and promotional material for tent-pole releases, actors and directors often wax lyrical about how ‘it’s all about character’ when more often then not, the ‘talky bits’ are just there to get us to the next action set piece.In Logan however, James Mangold has really committed to the idea of a character driven comic book movie. Previous attempts often fall at the last hurdle, Batman Begins is a fantastic character piece until someone turns up with a mustache, a ‘microwave emitter’ and a plan to poison the city’s water supply in the third act.Logan is not afraid to pump the brakes and really dig in to why everyone is doing what they’re doing, why they’re thinking what they’re thinking etc.While this is a welcome change it also means the pacing of the movie is a little all over the place. When the action scenes kick in they are relentless, but they are few and far between which may disappoint fans hoping for a straight up action film.When all’s said and done Logan is a rare beast — a comic book movie that transcends the genre and is just a great movie full stop. Brilliantly directed, perfectly acted and subtly written, Hugh Jackman’s X-Men swan song is no doubt an early entry into 2017’s top ten lists.",1
351,"Okay, this film is one of the best in 2017. it had all the elements that every great movie should have. Best superhero movie since the dark knight!. 9/10*. Maybe the best movie in 2017",1
352,"The best movie of 2017 in my opinion. It had a great, and emotional ending to an iconic character in the X-Men series. Highly recommend watching this.",1
353,i honestly (and still) loved Logan. it was the best of the three standalone wolverine movies (which isn't too hard to beat) and possibly the most accurate portrayal of the character. this movie adds depth to Logan showing the viewer what he is thinking and what he i actually capable of and I think the R rating was necessary to pull this off as it Logan inst a pg character.I also love the dynamic between x23 and Logan. Logan is wise and old and x23 is naive and young Logan sees himself in her and doesn't want her to make the same mistakes. he also feels responsible for the deaths of the people around him and is stricken by greif as there isnt much left for him to live for. which brings me to my next point. this movie flips the whole dynamic of Charles Xavier and Logan on its head in poetic way. the father has become the child and the child has become the father. Logan is look after an even older frailer prof.x who cant control his powers anymore. and appart from x23 charles is the only thing keeping logan alive.,1
354,"Logan was a dark, violent, and satisfying end to the Wolverine, even though they will still have Hugh Jackman back again for the X:Men movies. This was a very needed movie, because of is darker tone and the R rating. All of this was fitting for a Wolverine movie.",1
355,"James Mangold's Logan is a true masterpiece of a film. Hugh Jackman's last appearance as the titular character, was outstanding and he gives it his all. Along with Hugh Jackman is Patrick Stewart playing Professor X for one last time. I really loved the new character, X-23 and the villains, Donald Pierce & X-24. In the end this is a flawless film with massive amounts of emotion and really awesome action sequences. My rating would be 10/10",1

Very cool performances by many characters especially the star, Hugh Jackman. The story and script were top notch and one of my most liked Marvel films of all time. No wonder it got an Oscar nom for the screenplay. The fight scenes and choreography were straight up dope! Hugh Jackman straight up went greatest showman on their ass on this one. Absolutely spectacular performance. For the fans, the X23 character’s played by Dafne Keen is great as well, I kinda want an X23 movie after seeing this.",1
359,A mixture of a comic-book film and a western. The action is raw and the characters are grounded. I gave this film extra points for going above my expectations. A must see for those who are a fan of the genre.,1
360,"Logan is a masterpiece from the mid-way point on. The moments and sequences between him and Laura entice some of the most powerful of all the X-Men films. But is hardened by an overly grueling and painfully unnecessary first few acts. It's gritty and intense, but overshoots in trying to be a half-apocalyptic type story, when the good stuff is in the survival journey with Logan and Laura. And where it ends up results in a beautifully engrossing and personal conclusion to a character and series that touched our hearts so dearly. Farewell old friend.",1
361,"In the near future, a weary Logan (Hugh Jackman) cares for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart) at a remote outpost on the Mexican border. His plan to hide from the outside world gets upended when he meets a young mutant (Dafne Keen) who is very much like him. Logan must now protect the girl and battle the dark forces that want to capture her. Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as Wolverine with a gritty, nuanced performance in a violent but surprisingly thoughtful superhero action film that defies genre conventions. I'll Give Logan an A+. (10/10)",1
362,"Logan ist ganz anders als die üblichen Superheldenfilme, er ist brutal, hat keine witzigen Sprüche und ist verdammt ehrlich. Logan basiert lose auf den Comic ""Old Man Logan"" von Mark Millar. Der Film spielt im Jahr 2029 wo alle Helden tot sind und Wolverine alias Logan sich zurückgezogen hat und als Chauffer arbeitet. Eines Tages trifft er jedoch das Mädchen Laura und alles ändert sich. Dies alles ist spannend verpackt und Logan scheut sich nicht Gewalt zu zeigen wodurch er die Altersfreigabe ab 16 definitiv verdient hat. Hugh Jackman spielt einen tollen Wolverine aber auch Dafne Keen (Laura) spielt großartig. Der einzige Schwachpunkt ist wie bei Marvel typisch der Antargonist der jedoch noch wesentlich authentischer ist als die meisten anderen in Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ich empfehle jeden Logan zu schauen da er zeigt dass ein Superheldenfilm nicht immer lustig sein muss und sich auch ruhig trauen kann etwas brutaler zu sein.",1
363,"a movie that runs away in a good way from the superhero movies style. Can emotion and reflect, combining action and explanation scenes, not requiring prologues or sequences",1
364,"Logan is brutal, bloody, and violent. But at the same time, Logan is sad, somber, and heartfelt.",1
365,Most Awesome movie I've ever seen. Excellent performance by the cast....thanks to hugh Jackman we got the best of Wolverine. We definitely need more awesome Wolverine movies like this one. #TheBestSuperHeroMovie #BlackPantherMyAss,1
366,Showing are favorite hero slowing passing away in front of our eyes makes it the best goodbye performance I ever seen. Sadder than Yondu's death...,1
367,"Logan had to drive a small limousine as a living with bad eye-sight and declining health, while,on stark contrast, Tony Stark could thrown wild party but still running his high-tech research. Logan didn't have much respect from the people he supported,Tony was always a spotlight star. Tony was born with super powder and he achieved it by his passion in mechanics which is quite commendable but what makes Logan more admiring is his caring character.",1
368,"I always have hard time deciding between The Dark Knight and this. They are different genres, but they are both master piece. I think R rating was miraculous decision, and it really helped the film to become true Wolverine film. I don't often cry when I watch films, I only cried less than 5 times before, but I cry every time when I watch this film. I can not believe that same director as The Wolverine directed this. However, if you didn't watch all the X-Men series you will not get the feeling that I got.",1
369,마지막에 참다가 로건 무덤 초라한거 보고 결국 눈물 흘렷습니다... 울버린을 보내주기에 완벽한 영화,1
370,"Logan...uma franquia...um personagem memorável e que marcou gerações, podemos o chama-lo de Wolverine também, mas conhecemos ele definitivo neste filme impressionante. Em questão pelo filme em si, ele é perfeito, o filme se dirige a uma das cenas mais lindas na MCU (mesmo sendo da Fox, é isso que eu quis dizer), linda em detalhes, realismo, e atuações impecáveis como da jovem filha de Logan, foi um ato necessário e direto ao ponto. A jovem chorando, Logan cravado sobre a tora de madeira, a raiva consumindo-a e destroçando o inimigo. Veremos mais Hugh nas telas ou é o fim definitivo? Saberemos mais para frente.",1
371,"A poetic film as if it were a John Ford movie. Not only is it a goodbye movie, but it is an epicle that shows the most human side of the superhero. There are no glorious battles, no people to do your deeds, there are no great rewards at the end, and there is not even an end, the only thing is the heroes in front of the epligro, which uses its biggest weapon to fight against him: his spirit. And it serves as the future of the heroes and how nothing is neither powerful nor eternal. Magnificent",1
372,"The best x men movie by far and the best of the marvel associated movies. Dark, serious and moody, this film can be enjoyed just as a movie and not just a superhero fan. A great cast and story that takes you through the story of Logans failings and X23s struggle.",1
373,"With a right amount of brutal violence and touching scenes, Hugh Jackman's final outing as Wolverine is not only one of the best films in the X-Men series, but one of the best superhero films too.",1
375,"The action is shown right from the start also when you see these thugs try to steal his tires and Logan just kills them and you blood flying, people dying and limbs being chopped off.  From there I was on board with this movie and couldn’t believe that Fox finally went in a direction that was truly accurate to the character.  This is some the best action we have ever scene in an “X-Men” movie and I put quotes around that because it doesn’t feel like an X-Men movie.  Still, you see amazing action that is true to the character.  Logan is just tearing people up and killing people like crazy.  What’s great here is that it is very realistic action in terms what happens to people when Logan kills them.  What’s great about this characterization of Logan is that you see a more damaged character and a hero who is just done being a hero and just wants a normal life and is truly just broken from all the things he’s been through. So, Logan is looking after Professor X and he is also damaged and is going crazy from his seizures and Logan is the only one who can move through this and give Charles his medicine.   Logan, from the start, let’s you know that this is a totally different Wolverine movie.  You see Logan years later and totally beaten to hell and back and is done fighting. This part with Professor X is also great because you see these two characters finally on a similar level of living.  By that I mean you see these two characters both broken and in pain.  You never saw this in any other movie, in other movies Professor X was the wise man that helped Logan find out who he was and always had the answers.  Now, you see Logan risking his life to keep Professor X alive because that’s his beacon of the few good things that Logan had in his life.  This direction of the characters was great because you see these two great soldiers in a place you’ve never seen them before, vulnerable.When the little girl, which we pretty much know is X-23, comes along she kicks ass like no other and gives amazing action to the scenes where she loses it.  Also, for a majority of the movie she doesn’t even talk but still gives an amazing performance just from her physical acting all together.  When she comes out the first time and the hunter says “no, no no!”  you feel his feat just from her walking towards them looking angry and seeing her claws come out.  So, Logan is dragged into this chase for the girl and now has to protect her from these people hunting her.  Logan’s disposition is even more known when you clearly see that he has no desire to help because he has had it with trying to help people.  He even makes a good point when he says that people he tries to help eventually die.  Still, Logan, X-23 and Professor X all are running from these hunters and must keep this mutant girl from being captured and possibly killed.  The villain of the movie was great also, he held his own against Logan, not in terms of a fight but just through speaking.  What was great about this villain was that he was very smug but also charming in a way.  That was a great villain to have because that feature lended itself to the character being a great adversary to go against Logan.One of the best parts of this besides the blood-drawn action is the message the movie gives you.  Really, Logan is truly about family and not turning your back on others who need your help.  This is made evident when Logan, X-23, and Professor X are sitting with a family and a table and just having a good time and sharing a laugh.  That is probably my favorite scene in the movie because you see the life that Logan really wanted.  He wanted a simple life and the people he held closest to share it with.  You see here that Logan does care for the girl and she cares about him in some way.  You see a relationship finally developed between these characters.  But, I will say that the relationship really derailed after the farm sequence because Logan goes back to not wanting to help her.  It’s a nitpick but I felt as if the character just took a 180 degree turn and I just felt like it was sudden.  While it was accurate to the character, I just felt as if it didn’t happen and be discovered organically.Logan is a great movie with an Oscar worthy performance by Hugh Jackman in his last movie as Wolverine.  Please consider this man for the Oscars, because he deserves it.  Great action, characters, villains and a great message all led to an emotional and bad-ass movie that brings more to Logan.  But, what makes this movie even better is that it is not only a great comic book movie, but it can easily be taken as an amazing stand-alone movie like The Dark Knight was. Thank you Hugh Jackman for saving your best for last and giving your best interpretation of your character ever!",1
376,"Logan is my favorite movie of all time after seeing it. This movie has some comedy, a lot of heart, and great action. Hugh Jackman does such a tremendous job as Wolverine and it is really sad to see him go. This movie is basically a western and yes, it does have a lot of story similarities to The Last of Us. The plot is that Logan needs money so he can buy a boat for Charles Xavier who is suffering from a brain disease, and he wants to get away from the world, so he takes a job to take X-23, played greatly by Dafne Keen. This leads to a lot of problems where Logan loses his friends, but finds that the protection of this girl is important. Especially since she has the same powers as him, and he knows what she has been through because he's gone through it. There's this great line at the end of the movie where Logan says to X-23, ""Don't be what they made you,"". That's what I've really loved about Wolverine in these movies is that he has a lot of heart and he really cares about people, and yet he is a tortured soul. It's surprising to me that he never joined Magneto in the movies, because he seems on the outside like the kind of person who would, but on the inside he is someone with a great heart, and Hugh Jackman does a tremendous job as the character. Logan has a ton of heart, which is why I think it stands out from the rest of the superhero movies out there. It doesn't feel like a typical superhero movie and that's why it works. The performances overall are tremendous, the writing is great, and the music is great as well. If there was one thing I wasn't a fan of, it would be the villain, not Donald Pierce, but the other guy that Pierce was working for. He wasn't on screen all that much, and then at the end when we start learning more about him, he suddenly dies. But I don't think this one thing detracts from this film whatsoever. It is a fantastic film from start to finish.",1
377,"In one of the most original superhero movies ever made, James Mangold crafts a wonderfully dark, violent and deep tale, strengthened by Jackman's best performance as Wolverine.",1
378,"Wolverine is perhaps the most beloved character from X-Men film series, but his solo outings have been the most forgettable and/or full of s**t. Thankfully, we have Logan to break that trend. Still have issues with it, but I would acknowledge that it was one of the best films in X-Men series. ..Good : Hugh Jackman gives the most intense and gritty performance as Wolverine in his final film role as the adamantium clawed mutant. I have always loved him as Wolverine, but he has never been so good. Patrick Stewart does the same in his final role as Charles Xavier, and in his part, there's nothing to complain either. Dafne Keen as Laura - owns the film. Loved the kid as baby/lady Wolverine (X-23). The setting feels really different in this movie, compared to those of other X-Men films. It is obvious that they gave a Revisionist Western tone to the movie, which hasn't been done in the genre so far. It acknowledged the fact that it was inspired by Unforgiven, The Wrestler and Shane, which if had not been done, would've made it look like a ripoff. Not a total waste of a film, it has good parts, but still a copied idea without acknowledgement seems bad. Then, there is action. The actions are the best ones in the entire X-Men film series. The choreography is great to say the least. It looks badass, savage and intense. But there's one thing that this film does with action which most action films don't with these days. And that is, have the actions mean something. Every action scene has a purpose. It either sets up a characterization, or aggressively portrays what a character is feeling. Acting, action and the overall story won't disappoint. Also, all the characters are interesting. ..Mixed : There are some story issues. It feels as if there is a huge story that needs to be told between the altered timeline of DoFP and Logan. We get tiny little expositions for that matter and sound like much more interesting ideas for a better X-Men Apocalypse movie. This made the largely different characterizations feel totally out of place, for both Xavier and Logan. It works for the movie, I like it, but I don't buy it. It felt a lot out of the place and quite confusing with why they were so different. With all the movies in the series, I don't think they have given all the character development necessary for those changes. ..Bad : Mostly, it's the villain and some logic issues. There's a video narration/exposition which looked professionally edited with great voiceover, but was by a nurse who didn't even have 12 hours to do it, keeping aside the resources. Xander Rice doesn't feel so good of a villain. Nothing to blame Richard Grant, but just not a compelling villain. X-24 does have a frightening presence, I acknowledge that. But all his likeability depends upon the character arc of Wolverine over the years. Just take out the ""humane"" part of the character of Wolverine, and replace it with Terminator's menace. You'll get X-24. ..Conclusion : It's a good goodbye to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. You can get the unpleasant satisfaction of seeing him die, and it does hit emotional notes a number of times and feel really saddening. But there are story and characterization issues which cannot be overlooked and to be honest, do not make a good sense. ..Rating. ..Score : 8.2/10Grade : A-",1
379,I cannot put into words how amazing this film is. I never cared so much for a character and this is something Disney will never get right in their cookie-cutter films. 9.6/10,1
380,"Logan é um filme excepcional e um grande presente aos fans!Esse filme teve um historia diferente desde o principio, antes mesmo das gravações, e é claro que estamos falando do conceito. Filmes +18 estão longe de ser uma prioridade por serem muito arriscados no que se diz respeito a bilheteria, então esse foi um projeto inseguro desde o inicio, mas com todo esforço de Hugh Jackman e alguns produtores, o filme surgiu. É provável que essa seja a ultima vez que veremos o mesmo como Logan nos cinemas, o que é muito impactante visto que nunca houve outro Wolverine antes, então eles tinham de fazer algo especial, e felizmente isso aconteceu.O filme é pesado desde o principio, deixando bem claro que o mundo não é mais o mesmo, e que o próprio Logan está mais arrasado do que nunca, com sequelas físicas e mentais. Também é posta uma abordagem realista que não é muito rotineira nos filmes do gênero - e aqui dá muito certo. A atmosfera é dolorosa e quase que sentimos na pele de tão empático que o enredo se torna. Claro que há uma determinada facilidade em criar laços entre o publico e os personagens, visto que já os conhecemos de obras anteriores, mas aqui eles vão além. Você sente raiva, tristeza, melancolia e até dor, no que se diz respeito a uma empatia mais primaria. A luta entre Logan e sua versão mais nova é simplesmente dolorosa ao extremo. Não posso deixar de mencionar quão bem feito foram os efeitos técnicos e práticos desse filme, que não exita em mostrar a violência que as habilidades do Logan o permitem fazer - Ela não é exaltada, apenas retratada.Quanto as atuações, Hugh Jackman e Patrick Stewart entraram de cabeça no projeto, sendo capazes de presenciar as cenas mais dramáticas do filme, e também passando sutileza nos momentos onde há um alivio no ambiente, como na cena fantástica do Jantar. Dafne Keen é muito promissora e cumpre bem o seu papel, Stephen Merchant consegue passar seu pesar de arrependimento apenas com seu olhar, sendo muito importante para a construção da importância do seu personagem, e Boyd Holbrook, apesar de não ter muito tempo de tela, chama atenção com sua carisma e charme. Enfim, aqui há momentos melancólicos, nostálgicos, tristes e até alegres, mensagens que poucas pessoas vão captar, pois não passaram por tal experiencia - me incluo nesse grupo, fora a habilidade de passar um misto de emoções que deixa qualquer fan com o coração quebrado ao termino do filme. Nota 9.",1
381,"Logan is a movie that will leave you speechless, from the moment it begins to the moment it ends, every aspect of the film is like a punch in the face (in the best way possible). The emotion, the tone, the aesthetic, the dialogue, the sentiment, the music, it all culminated in the best movie of all time.	The film constantly keeps an almost “run down” tone. Everyone is tired, everything is gloomy, and the only setting we see is the desert and a rainy cemetery. We are shown exactly what Logan is feeling, in everything that surrounds him. The only time the setting changes is when the characters are at the farm, and the end in the forest. Logan is shown to us in everything around him, and everything he does. Every decision made by the filmmakers makes sense in the best way. Every character in the movie feels real and completely realistic. Logan is run down, but not a complete **** He still cares deeply for Charles, and later Laura, and is shown to be protective of the family he has found. Laura feels like a real 10 year old. She doesn't trust everyone completely, but she cares for them and forms real relationships with them. Laura’s way of convincing Logan to take her to North Dakota is just repeating the names of her friends endlessly until he relents, what genius. Charles acts exactly like a grandfather, from being the one to insist to take help and get supplies, to reminiscing with Laura about old movies. The characters act like they always have, Logan is still gruff and mean, Charles is still a bit of a know it all, but they also adjust to their new environments and circumstances, and they are clearly shown to take on character traits accustomed to a father and grandfather, without ruining all the character they already had. Plus, the way Logan wears his dollar store glasses on the bridge of his nose with the tag still on as he watches a phone held a foot away from his face is so perfect, the moment that scene was shown its like, “Yeah. That’s a dad.” The ending itself is the most emotionally exhausting thing I’ve ever witnessed. The entire third act is a marathon, not a sprint. From the part at the farm house, the end of the credits, I felt like I didn’t breathe. The emotion is spectacularly built, from the music to the acting to the way everything is shot. The very choice of a final villain is genius in itself. The very idea that Logan is fighting himself is obviously metaphor in itself, but one that works just way to well. But by far the best part of the third act is the performances. Never once did I question what a character was feeling, it was obvious in not only their choices, but simply their facial expressions. The scene where Logan runs back into  the house to find the clone has injured Charles and taken Laura, and he stands at the base of the steps trying to choose who to help first is INCREDIBLE. It is so easy to understand the conflict that every single character is facing. When the actual ending comes, I must say, i did sob. Not only I sob though, I was struck completely still for the entirety of the credits, quietly sobbing and barely breathing. For 24 hours after the credits ended, I was brought to tears at the very thought of the film, and couldn’t bare to watch anything else. Anytime I tried watching anything else, I was struck by just the emotion of the film’s end, and found myself incapable of absorbing anything else. It has been over a month, and I still can’t listen to “The Man Comes Around” without breaking down into tears. The pure power that movie’s ending alone has are amazing. In superhero movies, it is often hard to completely feel as if a character is truly dead, but Logan defies that. Teh very thought that Fox or Disney may bring Logan back makes me fill with rage. Logan’s ending was the perfect ending, and nothing will ever top it.	One of the best parts of Logan is the way it completely mocks every other superhero movie ever. There’s blood everywhere, everyone’s cursing, dead bodies cover every inch of the ground, and no one seems completely happy after a fight. The first fight we see Logan get into doesn’t show him willingly filling up with bullets, but acting almost exhausted every time a bullet enters him. Not to say he’s completely bothered, in fact he only fights back when a bullet hits his rental car, which in itself is so perfect. Several scenes like this stand out, the scene where they try to run a fence down with their car but it instead just bends inward for instance is so perfect. The decision to make this movie R is one I am forever grateful for. The very idea of making a movie like this PG makes me want to laugh. The blood, the cursing, the violence, it's all so perfect.",1
382,"Great movie, and story. Personally one of my favorites, and probably the best of wolverine X men.",1
383,The best farewell movie for Jackman's Wolverine as well as Stewart's Professor X. This is the kind of superhero movie that rises above even the other X-men movies.,1
384,"This is by far one of the best super heros ever made which stands besides the Dark Knight Series and The Watchmen. It delivers a different formula in terms of the story line as it takes a turn from the classic hero story. Logan who has lost everything, now once again has something to lose, the girl (X-23). The film grips the audience as the director has no mercy in terms eliminating the main characters and the gruelling action get people out their seats worried for the protagonists. James Mangold and Marvel alters the mutant, Wolverine to the broken human Logan.",1

388,"A great and emotional ending to the Wolverine trilogy and Hugh Jackman's Logan. Good story, plot and villains; great visual effects; good production design, music, make-up, character and emotional development; Laura's action scenes are great, the rest are good; good casting; great performance from Hugh Jackman as Logan, Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier and Dafne Keen as Laura; good performances from Richard E. Grant as Dr. Zander Rice, Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce, Stephen Merchant as Caliban. I like what they do to Charles and his power.",1
389,"For drama it was possible to weave into the plot of Daken, son of Logan, to go through comics, add more anger, aggression and make a really high quality film.  Perhaps even with a claim to an Oscar and other awards.  Or at least, elementary, to screen the comic book ""Old Man Logan"".  But Hugh Jackman is too simple-minded by himself.  Probably wouldn't have done him any good.  It turned out that it turned out - the film is not bad, but not a masterpiece and no ""epic"".  The Wolverine fans, performed by Hugh Jackman, will be satisfied.  Because, in fact, the movie was made for people like that...",1
390,This movie is probably tied for my favorite X men movie.  I would give this a ten but the movie doesn't really make sense with the timeline.,1
