0,"Yes, the movie has flaws. But who cares? ""The Matrix"" is a astonishing movie that is for-your-eyes only. The film has top notch (slo-mo was first introduced by this movie) CGI as well as a well rounded plot. It gives you more than you can ask for from a 1990's action film.",1
1,"An excellent movie with tons of special effects, fight scenes, etc., and the best thing is that they are all done perfectly. A really good film with an interesting story behind it. YOU'LL ENJOY IT.",1
2,"The best thing about the Matrix is the fact that it's such a brilliant, brilliant idea. The world you live in is virtual. In reality, you are an energy source in a jelly sac harvested by a race of machines... It makes me think of so many things... and I thought of whether I would take the blue pill or the red pill... you know, I'd probably take the blue pill.",1
3," What a concept! Although the movie is well executed, it is not exceptional. It makes for an entertaining ride.",1
4,"Groundbreaking synthesis of East meats West, in a brilliant sci-fi mind-scape....trippy, cool, and fun ride all around.Forget the sequels, they suck",1
5,"First off, I would give matrix a 9.5 out of 10. Visuals are great, and so are the action sequences. They're really epic, plus they're great to watch. Score is great. The story is also very good to. Acting is really good. Everyone does a great job throughout the movie. Overall, The Matrix is a great sic-fi action blockbuster that a great movie to watch. You really should watch this movie.",1
6,"After I have seen The Matrix, I instantly placed it at the #1 spot of the list of my favorite movies. Since then, 13 years has passed, I have seen over a hundred new movies. The Matrix still occupies that top spot. Inception was good, but no where near The Matrix good. If you haven't seen The Matrix series, I pity you, for you have missed the BEST movie ever made, go see it NOW!",1
7,"In my top ten movies of all time. What a shame the sequels sputtered out or this Trilogy could have been the most epic in the history of film making. Could have been our generation's STAR WARS. Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda.",1
8,The thought that went into this movies plot is astounding. I can understand how some could be confused and dislike it but ive found the more i watch this film the more i love it. Some minor flaws here and there but overall an amazing film.,1
9,"Amazing, definitely a timeless masterpiece. Some of the utmost original storylines of science-fiction genre, introducing a brilliant and new reality that will break with all the standards and blow away your mind. The perfect combination between action scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat and reflective dialogues concerning the movie's very deep theme. Additionally, the technical production is astonishing with very good graphic special effects that form an unbelievably awesome visual appeal. Truly a must-watch production that will not leave you unchanged.",1
10,If You Ever had to choose one movie for your unborn child to see. It would definitely be the matrix. FREE YOUR MIND.   The perfect illustration of control and power and how it influences everything around you,1
11,"The Matrix was genius. Acting was great, the story: perfection, direction was perfect, and then the fights were absolutely badass, and anyone who's seen it would agree.",1
12,"Really recommend this movie (not the sequels however). Good plot and storyline, nice special effects (not too overdone) and if you can overlook the plot holes and suspend disbelief, your in for a great ride!",1
13," The greatest action movie of all time, my favorite movie, its so perceptive so mind boggling you will watch it more than once to then fall more in love with the matrix a world without borders or boundaries. I love this movie.",1
14,a fun sci fi action flick with fantasic action and effects . the story is pretty entertaining and keeps you interested . the film has a great plot twist that i dont think any one seeing this for the first time will ever see coming . the story feels fresh and original . the acting is abit dry but fits this film and especialy Reeves who i dont think you could get any dryer then his acting .,1
15,"Well, after all these years of gaming communities being inspired by it as well as parodies from other films. I finally watched it. The film is confusing in some ways but it really makes you think. The film is very entertaining and has very impressive CGI for 1999. It's definitely worth watching.",1
16,"THE MATRIX is the best action movie ever made in my list. When Matrix released on its time, thiz movie created many breakthrough on world cinema. Directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, who is just recently popular in thiz movie. They just known previously as small budget film Director, BOUND (1996). Later, the movie has two more sequels MATRIX RELOADED and MATRIX REVOLUTION in 2003. You can almost classify the Stars of thiz movie as B-Class Casts, except Keanu Reeves, but still the outcome is beyond the expectations. Each of the characters like: Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) , even the villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) already become a legendary icon in the industries. One of the fervencies of thiz movie is on the action scene. The fight scene is something new and different, which follows later by other movies. Behind that extraordinary fight scene is well-known Martial Arts Choreographer, Yuen Woo Ping. Woo Ping is the man behind CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON(2000), KILL BILL (2003),THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM (2008), even Jackie Chan classic action SNAKE IN THE EAGLE SHADOW (1978). His experiences in a lot of Asian movies made him effective.  The movie definitely exceed beyond our imagination. In fact, many people did not understand entirely the story of THE MATRIX, there are still many blank spot to question about. The Content of the movie fills with great philosophies inside. It seemed to me Wachowski Brothers discovered successfully how to make a brilliant concept from some of religions. The essence is not that simple as appear to be, Actually we will always have something new, every time we watch it. Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",1
17,"This movie was a well done action movie. It has some problems with the story line, but the action scenes are undeniably astonishing. This movie introduced the Slow Motion concept to other movie makers, and it has been a hit ever since. I would definitely consider this movie to be a modern classic action film. The movie certainly goes above and beyond the standard 90's movie.",1
18,"This film is much more than most of people can understand.It just try to open our eyes, we are in the matrix and this world is not what we think it is, and this movie is made by this people for this people, just as James Cameron Avatar that shows to the world the true reality, from whence we came and where we can go.",1
19,"The MatrixAverage User Score: 8.710The Matrix ImageThe Matrix takes mystery school concepts and philosophies of Gnosticism, Eastern religions, Western Religions and even ideas from the Natural Law movement and blends them together to create a cryptic, symbolic action film. Everything in this movie has occult meaning, but it's up to us, the viewers to figure out what that meaning is. This movie is like a puzzle. But this is all done in a very cool, entertaining way with awesome special effects (cutting edge at the time it was released) and great memorable action scenes, some which have greatly influenced the special effects of Hollywood movies produced afterwards. My only complaint about this movie is the way the love of Neo by Trinity is revealed, I mean you have no idea and I remember in the theater myself and everyone around me groaning since the whole love story in action films thing has been done to death and this seemed so cliche. The love between Trinity and Neo is very important to the trinity in the long run but imo it could have been introduced in a much better manner, maybe some flirting scenes leading up to it because you just don't see it coming at all which makes it really unrealistic. But other than that a great, epic movie. The Matrix (and the entire Matrix Trilogy) is like an onion, it has many layers of meaning, and every-time I watch it I notice something new. Definitely a masterpiece with profound hidden meaning and my favourite movie off all time to this day. 10/10",1
20,"This is the best sci-fi movie ever made, together with Star Wars IV and V, of course. I can't tell you much about it. You REALLY need to watch it so you can make conclusions.",1
21,"I feel bad for those morons who think The Matrix sucks. this is a brilliant movie full of epic nonstop action. If you like movie with awsome acting,music, and badass slo-motion fight scenes, etc. then get this, if you aren't... well buy Legend of the Guardians.",1
22,"Despite TRON being my all time, video game related movies of all time, The Matrix is my all time bad ass, cool, computer/hacker movies.  I find it hard NOT to love.  It has action, martial arts so the 'easily entertained by action' viewers can have something, the 'computer goers' like myself have something to get into and when it's all thrown together it makes the perfect combination of action and story.",1
23,The best sci-fi movie of its time.Excellent original soundtrackI still keep the thinking as a reference for some of my work and my everyday life. Loved it.,1
24,"Saw this movie for the first time yesterday. Although a lot of it was cheesy and the costumes were ridiculous, it was very engrossing and I was never bored.",1
25,The beginning of the movie for me was very confusing but by the end all your questions will be answered. The slo-mo and CGI make the tricks a whole lot better.,1
26,"If I was dying and had to recommend to my child only 1 film to watch until they understand it fully, it would be the Matrix (trilogy). That's how good it is.",1
27,"My third favorite movie ever and one of the four films I consider to be perfect.  While Keanu Reeves delivers his usual grade of acting, he more than makes up for it as the badass hero.  The premise, while questionable from a logical standpoint, is haunting and deeply thought-provoking.  The effects still hold up today and give the action sequences a special charm.  Oh, and the ending is just one of the most satisfying ever. The Matrix is definitely a 10/10 in my book.",1
28,"I am just fascinated by the idea of the movie:""Human reproduction has stopped, humans are used as an infinite source of energy."" So basically they are grown as mere vegetables.Everyone agrees that the fight sequences are more than awesome. Special effects are spectacular considering the year the film was made.The first part of The Matrix is more than enough to satisfy your expectations from a sci-fi movie.",1
29,"The Matrix was (in 1999) a complete revolution in Hollywood film-making. Combining state of the art CGI effects, proper old-school Hong Kong style fight choreography, and an intelligent, well written story... It comes together and creates an instant classic. It's one of those 'where were you when you first saw it' movies, that resonate for years afterwards in your own mind. Asking questions about human existence, free will, fate, morality, duality of self... It's a philosophical debate hiding inside a kick-ass action movie. It's one of the most 'complete' films too, with an ending that makes sense and leaves the imagination to wonder what might actually happen. Two vastly inferior 'cash-grab' sequels followed, no doubt at the insistence of a studio desperate for more, and probably used as a gun to the head to the Wachowski Brothers. It's not a perfect movie, the whole 'Jesus' paradigm is a little forced, and the much lauded 'bullet time' special effect now looks very dated! But, forget the sequels, watch the original. If you've never seen it, I guarantee it won't disappoint.",1
30,"Not the best movie of all time, but I really appreciate ambitious movies that are full of interesting ideas. The matrix is certainly ambitious and has many new, interesting ideas. A lot of fun to watch.",1
31," The Matrix is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. Period. I will explain though. Most people have an issue with the movie for one of two reasons: the special effects and the plot. First, I'm not a huge martial arts guy, so I'm definitely nowhere close to being an expert on this, but the action scenes were pretty awesome. The combination of slick and fast hand-to-hand with a load of guns thrown in...awesome. The music to the fights completed the experience. The second issue most people have with the Matrix is something I am quite familiar with: the plot. The plot of the Matrix is fantastic. That is because of two things: One, it is a fresh idea. The Matrix's plot is not a clone of anything. And two, the plot is incredibly deep, having multiple levels for every part in it. The agents, Neo being freed, the idea of the Matrix itself, all great. If you don't like sci-fi, then that's fine. You probably won't like this movie. You definitely won't like the sequels. But don't knock them for being ""stupid"" or ""moronic."" Because they simply aren't. And on a last note, the acting is exactly suited to this movie. The people in this movie act exactly how their characters should. Keanu Reeves was cast BECAUSE he acts the way he does on camera. It was perfect for the part. Hugo Weaving is SUPPOSED to be dry and humorless. Keep in mind the context of the characters when you judge acting. If you have any complaints, I'll be willing to defend the greatness of this movie. A 10 out of 10.",1
32,"Sure some things aren't perfect, and it can be kind of...meh, but it is still a fantastic movie. The whole concept is very interesting, making you think for a brief moment ""what if that's real?"" And on top of that, it is funny, dramatic, and has great action scenes. I think it's a great ride of 90's movies.",1
33,"Beautifully filmed and written. Best film of all time. The charcters are so real and engaging, the settings are perfect and I couldn't find a single fault if I tried.",1
34,Anyone who dislikes this film obviously doest understand what it is about and what point it is trying to get across. One of my favourite movies of all time.,1
35,"I strongly recommend this film; it's a golden experience that will change your life for the better. The effects still look great even fifteen years later. The story offers much food for thought. Morpheus, Neo, and Trinity transcend mere character into archetype. But who HASN'T felt as if this life is something less than it seems? This stands alongside 'Serenity' among science-fiction cinema's greatest champions of human liberation and truth. If you care about your mind, see this. You will not be disappointed.",1
36,"""You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. ""Morpheus",1
37,the only thing that even comes close to this is LOTR....but this is even more anti gov than anything i've ever heard of.....therefore this movie number 1 despite the sequels.....the fact that he gets covered in a mirror only makes metaphorical sense but like it a lot...the fact that the first cops are already dead is kinda lame....who cares....also who cares that morphius can only guide neo to evade the agents in the beginning.....that seriously might be all thats wrong with it .....whats wrong with me now is the question....- JRA,1
38,"Get this: what if all we know as reality was, in fact, virtual reality? Reality itself is a ravaged dystopia run by technocrat Artificial Intelligence where humankind vegetates in billions of gloop-filled tanks - mere battery packs for the machineworld - being fed this late '90s VR (known as The Matrix - you with us here?) through an ugly great cable stuck in the back of our heads. And what if there was a group of quasi-spiritual rebels infiltrating The Matrix with the sole purpose of crashing the ruddy great mainframe and rescuing humans from their unknown purgatory? And, hey, what if Keanu Reeves was their Messiah? What sounds like some web freak's wet dream is, in fact, a dazzlingly nifty slice of sci-fi cool. The Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry - last seen dabbling in kinky lesbian noir with the excellent Bound) pulling off something like a million masterstrokes all at once. Taking the imprimatur of the video game, they meld the grungy noir of Blade Runner, the hyperkinetic energies of chopsocky, John Woo hardware and grandiose spiritual overtones into William Gibson's cyberpunk ethos to produce a new aesthetic for the millennium powered to the thudding beat of techno. And it is just incredible fun. The key is the technique of ""flo-mo"", a process born from Japanese animation, whereby an object in motion is seemingly frozen while the camera miraculously spins around it as if time and gravity are on hold. It grants the action (including some killer kung fu which Reeves and crew spent months perfecting) liberty to take on surreal visual highs. Superhuman feats permissible, of course, in the context of VR as the rebels download Herculean ""talents"" to fuel their subterfuge. Meanwhile, the audience can only gawp longingly, with its jaws thunking to the cinema floor in unison, as the heroes wrapped in skintight leather, sleek shades and designer cheekbones, spin up walls, leap from high rises and slip through streams of bullets in silken slo-mo. Tron this ain't. Immediately reigniting the moribund cyberpunk genre (the kids can't get enough Stateside), this has thrust Reeves from his imploding career back to Speed highs (and laying to rest the hideous ghost of Johnny Mnemonic) and stolen much more of Star Wars' thunder than was thought humanly possible. For all its loony plot, The Matrix is fabulous. Sure, the expert Fishburne is depended upon to expound the lion's share of the script as seer-like rebel leader Morpheus. Reeves, stunning in his newcast slenderness, as Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson, the hacker turned hope for all mankind (care of some ill-defined mystical calling) is asked little more than perpetual befuddlement. Like Speed, though, this movie plays on his iconic looks rather than his oak-like emoting. There's a major find, too, in the irresistible Carrie-Anne Moss, a majestically wrought combination of steely **** intelligence and rock-chick vivaciousness as fellow tripper Trinity. And Weaving, cast against type, neutralises his Aussie tones to a freaky deadpan, the head of the MiB-styled defence system set against the Goth invaders. And sure, three minutes of post-movie deliberation and all this state-of-the-art cyberdevilry is reduced to the purest **** That, though, is not the point. The Matrix is about pure experience; it's been many a moon since the Empire crew have spilled out of a cinema literally buzzing with the sensation of a movie, babbling frenetically with the sheer excitement of discovery. From head to tail, the deliciously inventive Wachowskis (watch them skyrocket) have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool, the usher will have to drag you kicking and screaming back into reality. You can bet your bottom dollar George never saw this phantom menace coming. VerdictThe deliciously inventive Wachowskis have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool.",1
39,"Don't miss the first minute of this movie.  That's how fast and interesting it is.  And the most interesting concept of it all, that we are not really here.  Our perception of the world is a computer construct that we are hard wired into.  Too far out?  Then you won't like this.  By the way, Neo (Keanu) goes to a bar to meet his contact.  That bar is in Australia.  It was not constructed for this movie.  It and the patrons look like that everyday.  Too far out?  The sequels went downhill from this movie so I only have this one in my collection.",1
40,"The peak of Science-Fiction and also Action films. We owe gratitude to Lilly and Lana Wachowski, the creators of this absolute masterpiece. I'm not going to do dissection, write an analysis with risk to devalue the film and it's qualities. So just watch it and feel for yourself.",1
41," When I first saw this movie when I was twelve I didn't think much of it, I thought it had a confusing story and a mindless plot that was supported and only succeeded by out of this world slow motion stunts. Boy was I naive or what!? Now seeing it again after all these years I could see that I was not ready back then to handle a movie of this complexity and strange coherent means of story telling. But now I fully respect and love this movie for what it is and for what it always will be, mindbogglingly, mind blowing, out of this world fun. When the Matrix was released in 1999 this was the film to go see people were busting out of the theater's and telling anyone they can to go see this movie. It was the ""It"" movie of the year and it gained the title justly. This film mapped out new territory in action and ushered in a whole new generation of action & Sci-Fi thrillers and video games as well(Max Payne comes to mind) it is one of the biggest and most beloved film of the 90's and has one of the biggest fan base out there. This movie unique and I mean unique story and style has such and impact on you when you first see it you'll want to see it the minute it's over and some more after that and after that and you'll want to see it a million times it's just that good. The Matrix put's a Gothic and dark spin on the dystopia and apocalyptic themes that have become very common in Sci-Fi films, this film does it one better it takes those overly used themes and creates a completely original and unique world around which everything we Believe is a lie. It has a great monolithic tone to it that makes it a masterpiece by any standards and it creates a great aftershock in which few films can actually do these days. It purposes that machines while enslave humanity and use us as a battery source to power there vasts armies of machines around the world. But that's what makes it so great to watch it gives you a sense of hope and a sense of justice that you just feel all the way to your bones. This movie has given the fellow movie goer what they've always wanted and always searched for in a film, great action, a smart story and plot, acting you can live with and put them all together and what do you got? The Matrix! This movie will stick with long after it's over and even after tour old you'll still remember one movie that rocked your world like none other. All in all this film delivers great any day entertainment that is like Laurence Fishburn said, "" Unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is you have to see it for yourself."" And trust me once you do you won't ever look at Sci-Fi or other movies the same way again. This movie delivers.",1
42," Awesome action, awesome acting, awesome plot, awesome everything!",1
43, It is an epic. Classic. Great philosphy.,1
44, I thought the matrix was brilliant the god of Sci-Fi.,1
45," Great movie, a definite heartwarming, classic.",1
46,"After all those years this still remains probably the most perfect scifi action movie to date (together with T2). Maybe it only has 415 VFX shots (a romantic comedy these days has more vfx shots) but they are all used where they count the most and they still hold up very well for an almost 14 year old film. The Blu-ray transfer is absolutely exellent and as good as a 35mm on BD can ever look. There's not a scratch to be seen, not the slightest woble and just the right amount of grain (no NR). Some have complained about the colors but for me they look as they should be (the Matrix world a bit more greenish than the real world) and the detail in the black levels (of which there are allot) is perfect (on the first DVD release they were a bit mushy). The Dolby 5.1 sound of the DVD was already superb but here you get it in an uncompressed TrueHD track.",1
47,"The Matrix was a damn good movie.  This is review for the first movie because the other ones are in a different category (Matrix Reload, Matrix Revolutions).  The movie starts off with the audience saying, ""what the hell is going on.""  You don't have to wait until the end of movie to understand it.  About forty minutes into the movie you should understand it.  There is some guy Neo that is living in a dreamworld which is basically a huge computer program (that would be a butt load of html).  He eventually gets out of the dreamworld and is free.  If you want to know the rest you should see it.  Neo is played by Keanu Reeves (Speed), Agent Smith is the elf dude from Lord of the Rings, and Morphis can be found in Pee Wee's Playhouse (not kidding).  I believe that this movie helped change plot lines for movies.  This movie makes the audience confused for awhile yet the movie still kicks ass.  It seemed like many movies were sticking with simple plot lines with bombs and terrorists, etc.  Now we have movies that are confusing like Shutter Island and Inception.  The special effects in the movie are really good.  You cant tell what was computer created which is something that is not always present in today's movies.  If you have not seen this movie then you should buy and see it, because it is a movie that can be seen over and over again (the second and third Matrix movies are disappointing; so I would advice you not to necessarily buy those.",1
48,"Brilliant concept, perhaps a little more thought could have been given to the plot details, but most of this movie is for the eyes! The acting is amazing for a 1990's action film and undoubtedly one of my all-time favourites. The top-of-the-time CGI is breathtaking, spawning many cultural references to the 'Matrix Move' made popular by this film. Overall, this movie is extremely entertaining and will always be a favourite amongst many.",1
49,"Modern classics of Sci-Fi, this movie carries a whole philosophy in itself. Interesting setting and concept, martial arts, great fight scenes, bullet dodging and you name what else make this movie so popular, and it's popularity is fair.",1
50,This was an awesome film that should be watched by everyone.,1
51,"Great movie. A beautiful mix of action and thought-provoking ideas. Deserves a 10 for sure. This movie is a great movie to rent if you want a great thought provoking movie like Inception, with non-stop action. The special effects are a little cheesy though.",1
52,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time. Amazing special effects, surprisingly good acting, an interesting, different but yet soothing and epic soundtrack, and non stop action makes this movie amazing.",1
53,"A kinetic, spellbinding, revolutionary movie.  It's thought provoking, exciting, and one of the most memorable movies ever made.  It may have a few flaws, such as being a little too show offy with its visual effects, and some lines are extremely pretentious, but there are few films as atmospheric or as mind-bendingly ambitious as the Matrix.  Did I mention that the production design is incredible and that the score also fits perfectly?  Even Keanu Reeves' performance isn't terrible, which is almost impossible.  If you like sci-fi at all the chances are you'll love this.  But I'm willing to bet you already do.",1
54,"Quite possibly one of the greatest action movies of all time. The world of the matrix is so intriguing you can't help but be hooked on what the movie throws at you. Great characters, a gripping story and some great special effects even over 10 years later.",1
55,"The Matrix helps you thinking about the question ""What is reality?"". This is an epistemological question: is the world we see around us the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by neural processes in our brain.",1
56,"People have been telling me to watch this movie for the past 3 years. I only just recently sat down to watch it. And good God am I happy that I did. The whole premise of the movie is awesome. Evil robots against rebel humans is all you have to say and I'll be sold. To top it all off, the action is still awesome 15 years later. As far as action movies go, this is one of the best I've seen in a while.There are a few small flaws. At times the acting can be average, and there is one very glaring plot hole (I won't go into details due to spoilers). However these issues are not significant enough to hurt the experience.",1
57,"Matrix (1999) Matrix der Film aus dem letzten Jahrtausend. Ja, so alt ist dieser Film schon. Wenn man Matrix in ein Film-Genre einordnen wollte, so wären wohl Action und Science Fiction die Hauptkategorien. Das allein wird dem Werk jedoch nicht gerecht. Neben minutenlangen Baller-Szenen entpuppt sich eine Wahnsinnsstory, die ins Philosophische geht. Aber erst einmal zu den Anfängen.Der Protagonist, Thomas Anderson (gespielt von Keanu Reeves), ist ein Computer-Hacker und führt ein isoliertes Leben. Doch dann wird ihm eine geheimnisvolle Botschaft von Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) auf seinem Computer gesendet. Noch unklar, was ihn erwarten wird, beschließt er, dieser Nachricht auf den Grund zu gehen. In einem Nachtclub trifft er dann eine junge Frau namens Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), die ihn zu einem Treffen mit Morpheus überreden will. Durch eine Wendung der Ereignisse wird er zur Zielscheibe eines Agententeams. Die einzigen Personen, die ihm helfen wollen, sind eben jene zwielichtigen Personen, die ihm eine ""Wahrheit"" verkaufen wollen, die er sich nicht im Entferntesten vorstellen kann. Ist die Welt real oder nur eine computergesteuerte, von Maschinen beherrschte, virtuelle Illusion? Regie und Drehbuch führen die Wachowski-Geschwister, die ebenfalls das Drehbuch für ""V wie Vendetta"" schrieben. Ihnen und der sehr guten Leistung der Schauspieler ist es zu verdanken, dass zu keinem Zeitpunkt im Film eine Handlung realitätsfremd wirkt.Neben der erstklassigen Schauspielarbeit tragen die herausragenden Spezialeffekte enorm zur Atmosphäre bei.Für ein Science Fiction Werk genial, für seine Zeit Weltklasse. Bullet-Time, eines der wesentlichsten und markantesten Effekte, feierte nach Matrix eine Revolution im Action-Genre. Jedoch ist ihre Anwendung in Matrix bisher noch unübertroffen.Farbfilter, wie sie in ""300"" oder ""Kill Bill"" bekannt sind, kommen auch bei Matrix zu Einsatz. Wie bereits erwähnt sind aber gerade die philosophisch/religiösen Elemente und Hinweise, welche im ganzen Film durch Namensgebung Handlungen und Dialogen auftauchen, besonders hervorzuheben.  Versteckt unter der ganzen Action behandelt der Film die Mythen verschiedener Religionen und Weltanschauungen und wirft durchaus tiefgründige Fragen auf. Wer diesen Film noch nicht gesehen hat, wer seine Brillanz nicht verstanden hat, der sollte einen Besuch bei der Videothek einplanen. An diesem Meisterwerk führt kein Weg vorbei  Matrix ist die rote Kapsel  Teil 2 und 3 wohl eher die blaue…",1
58,"A really great and deep movie. Very interesting plot that will have you thinking  alot once it finishes. WIll simply blow your mind away, a must watch!",1
59,"The Matrix is a classic science fiction film that has a astonishing three  dimensional cartoon world and has artsy action like you would see in a comic book but in 3D. What makes the film special, is it's taking a journey with it's characters and people watching the movie trying to figure out this matrix universe, the film does not spoon feed the audience. It describe many details as possible. Neil (Keanu Reeves) is a young hacker who wants to know what is the matrix, so he thinks Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) the dangerous man alive, to answer his question. He is contacted by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) so they can go to a mysterious underworld were they'll meet Morpheus. Their fighting for their lives against intelligent secret agents. It is a truth that could cost Neo something more precious than his life. I don't care if people think Reeves is a bad actor, to be honest he's like able but this guy is trying to make his character awesome, likeable and to root for while he proves he's a physical actor, which makes the action more better. Laurence Fishburne as the leader is the best leader in the film, he awnsers all the questions that audiences have, he's something people need while watching the film. Writen and directed by the Wachowski brothers, they put so much detail in their marvel script and if there's one thing that they achieve in directing their action block busters is understanding the art of an action scene. Bill Pope's camera work is so mindblowing and that's why the Matrix is equally good about the film, and make the action scene more better. The film is well-made, astonishing camera work  and written  and directed by the talented Wachowski brothers. Grade A+",1
60,One of my favorite movies of all time that changed the face of special effects in movies forever.  This film is a must see for action fans and sci-fi fans.  This movie is a true masterpiece.,1
61,"The Matrix is one of the best movies that I've seen. The special effects, actors, everything in this movie is very well chosen and managed to be one of the best movie I've seen.",1
62,"'You think that's air you're breathing right now?' The Matrix whips up a feast of special effects, dialogue as well as sub textual meaning. Stellar performances by Reeves, Fishburne and of course Hugo Weaving as the indomitable Agent Smith, ensure that this movie sits rightly on the pantheon of classic sci-fi movies-wicked. The Wachowski brothers outdid themselves; using the Sydney CBD and the hovercraft to provide a dystopian setting, suitable for the new millennium. 5 Stars (from a biased Sydneysider).",1
63,"The Matrix is an awesome movie. I mean it's really the thinking man's action movie. What the wachowski brothers did with this film was amazing. The Kung-Fu action sequences were incredible, done to perfection. plus the bullet time sequences were  so cool, nothing else compares. I just loved this awesome  man's movie. Love it, Love it.",1
64,"the best of all time.i have one reason for that.any time you see this again discover new layer of film.its a full of meanings.involving and Philosophic.",1
65,"Loving the action sequences and special effects to this very day, I had my eyes focused on the situation on who is the matrix and how to know what it is from beginning to end, and filled me with lots of questions on reality(but knowing its not true and meant for entertainment) A spectacular thrill ride in the style of a cyber update of Alice in Wonderland, Keeanu Reeves plays Neo, a computer hack who unlocks the secret of the matrix and fines himself thrown into the deep underworld of reality where the discovery that interstellar machines have exploited the human race for generations, is uncovered. Neo is found by the rebellion and their leader Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who believes Neo is the chosen one, and they both set out to survive with freedom in their hands, and the Matrix is sending enemies closing in on them. though it was kind of flawed looking, it is still a great movie that could have been the next star wars hadn't its sequels been so awful other than that one of the most action packed sic-fi fantasies ever shown on the big screen which pill would you choose?",1
66,"There's no sophomore jinx for the Wachowski Brothers. Andy and Larry, a pair of obviously talented film makers, have returned to theaters with The Matrix, a science fiction thriller that is every bit the match of their debut effort, Bound, for tension, excitement, and intelligence. In an era when movie scripts (especially those pigeonholed into the science fiction genre) are becoming increasingly more stupid and special effects reliant, the Wachowskis prove that style and substance do not have to be mutually exclusive. I loved The Matrix, and only a few minor contrivances associated with the climax caused the film to miss a 10/10 rating. The movie is kinetic, atmospheric, visually stunning, and mind-bending. It toys with the boundaries between reality and fantasy in unique and interesting ways. In its approach and content, it reminded me of last year's vastly underrated Dark City. There's also a synergy with two movies due to be released within the next month: David Cronenberg's eXistenZ and Alejandro Amenabar's Open Your Eyes. The Matrix is undeniably science fiction, but, unlike most pictures claiming that association, it never falls into the boring, expected patterns of space battles and laser gun shoot-outs. Instead, it ventures into territory that, while not virgin, is sufficiently interesting to provide an involving, invigorating backdrop. There's much more to The Matrix than this, but to explain further would be to reveal plot twists better discovered through viewing. Although the film frequently toys with the blurred line between grim reality and computer-generated fantasy, it rarely leaves the viewer completely confused (except, perhaps, at the very beginning). The Wachowskis have carefully structured the story in such a way that the audience is capable of following the action and understanding what's going on even when all of the secrets have not been revealed. Nevertheless, because The Matrix is intelligent, it will defeat those unwilling to invest some intellectual participation. The payoff is worth the effort. Stylistically, The Matrix is much like Bound. Both films are visually stunning, with images painstakingly constructed and action sequences choreographed to excite the eye and quicken the pulse. The Wachowskis use a varied pallette that includes shadows, slow motion, quick cuts, and offbeat humor to paint a unique portrait. Like in Dark City, theirs is a grim world, where darkness and gloom seemingly always hold sway. Everything from the set design to the costumes (lots of black, lots of sunglasses) is intended to contribute to an overall look. When it comes to shoot-outs, the Wachowskis show that John Woo isn't the only director capable of doing interesting things with familiar devices. The shots of Keanu Reeves streaking down a hall with guns blazing all around him and the air thick with shattered bits of concrete is only one of many snapshots that lingers in the mind's eye long after they have vanished from the screen. The special effects, which are not as numerous as those in many science fiction pieces, are flawless. The Matrix offers a little something for everyone. The die-hard science fiction fan will discover a plot that mixes and matches both new and old conventions of the genre in a compelling fashion. Action aficionados will find that there's no shortage of electric excitement, whether it's in the form of hand-to-hand kung fu-type fights or shoot-outs with seemingly limitless ammunition. There's also betrayal, a little romance, some humor, and a moral dilemma or two, all wrapped into a well-produced package. As I stated earlier, the way in which the Wachowskis choose to resolve everything seems slightly contrived, but, in the overall scheme of things, that's a small price to pay for one of the most enjoyable science fiction thrillers to reach the screen in months.",1

His role as Neo fits the criteria. The Matrix needs a leading man who can look good, act cool, and not stumble over his dialogue, and Reeves is three for three. It's easily his best work since Speed, where the same kinds of demands were made of him. For more nuanced performances, the Wachowskis rely on the rest of the cast: the always excellent Laurence Fishburne, brilliant character actor Joe Pantoliano (who appeared in Bound), and Carrie-Anne Moss, who looks great in black leather. Aussie Hugo Weaving (Proof) brings the perfect mix of dry wit and menace to his role as the head Man in Black. The Matrix offers a little something for everyone.

69,"Someone roll in the green screen... The Wachowski brothers did an excellent job with this movie. The story is very interesting and the camera work is refreshing at the time, especially the special effects like bullet-time. Also the stunts like running on walls, dodging bullets and kung fu that excels any laws of gravity. And the camera always follows the actors even if they run on roofs, jump from building to building, through windows into the next building... Keanu Reeves is not the best actor but he's perfect in the role of the cool Neo and you gotta admit he looks good in black. Carrie-Anne Moss is a good counterpart for Neo. And then there's of course Hugo Weaving as agent Smith who...talks........ really................................................ slow. The real question burning on everybody's lips is naturally: are we really living in the Matrix? For the answer on that question please turn this page.",1
70,"This is a film of serious philosophical depth and insight. The Matrix also overflows with religious allusions and parallels from Christianity and Buddhism. Although The Matrix may seem loaded with stunning visuals only for the sake of visceral enjoyment at first, there is a profound interplay between the action and the underlying meanings of the film. The infrastructural visuals also give us a glimpse of this duality. While the world of the Matrix is portrayed as homogeneous, predictable, and tinted a sickly green, the real world is portrayed as dark, earthy and tinted a mysterious indigo.",1
71,"The Matrix. What can i say about it? It's an iconic movie. It created this huge popular phenomenon around it where almost everyone knows about the movie. The first and second act of the movie were really mind blowing and captivating. Unfortunately, The Wachowski brothers cinematography looks dated now, and the third act doesn't hold up anymore. All in all, it's a great movie. Great casting, good memorable characters, and the movie itself is very quote-able.",1
72,"You see a lot of reviews at Metacritic complaining about how ""overrated"" such and such a movie is. Well please allow me to nominate The Matrix as the Most Under-rated Movie here. The Matrix is more intelligent, more stylish, more exciting and better looking than any other movie made in the last twenty years. It is probably the best Science Fiction movie ever made, far better than such pretenders as Blade Runner or Forbidden Planet and challenged in stature only by the beauty and mystery of 2001 and by the pure popcorn entertainment of Star Wars.",1
73,"The action is right there... right where it lies, and you're going to love this action flick. What the Wachowski Brothers have in mind is what they appear as they direct the Matrix.",1
74,"After scoring an art-house hit with the small-scale, tightly plotted, highly enjoyable thriller Bound—which took off once the requisite overdone Zalman King-style lesbian sex had been taken care of—the Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry) have gone big, made a movie for über-producer Joel Silver, thrown in loads of special effects, and cast Johnny Mnemonic star Keanu Reeves in the lead. And damned if it doesn't work. In The Matrix, a surprisingly tolerable Reeves plays a pasty computer hacker who begins to receive mysterious messages from an unknown source. Shortly after encountering a bunch of identical-looking authority figures, he hooks up with a mysterious band of outsiders led by Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss (Models Inc.) who clue him in that nothing around him is as it appears. Story-wise, nothing in The Matrix will surprise too many people: In addition to resembling both in concept and content the worthwhile Dark City, there's not much more to it than ideas about the subjectivity of reality reworked from Descartes, Philip K. Dick, and William Gibson and channeled into an operatic science-fiction metaphor about non-conformity (and drug use). But the Wachowskis do it so playfully well, keeping The Matrix's potentially confusing plot intelligible, intelligent, and suspenseful, that it doesn't matter. As far as sheer spectacle goes, it's the most exciting thing to come along in quite a while. Where other films are done in by the freedom offered by computer effects, The Matrix integrates them beautifully, making fetus-tending robots, helicopters gently collapsing into buildings, and elaborate, gravity-defying kung-fu fighting seem like perfectly plausible elements of the universe it creates, a universe that deserves to be seen.",1
75,"My favorite film of all time. The Matrix brings visually and beautifully stunning effects with an excellent screenplay and direction from the two, plus great performances and pacing. It tells the story about a world where you are blinded from the truth, and everything is confusing. The reason I love this movie is because it is so smart and interesting to a society today, where we all have our screens and technology. What if we really were blinded from the truth, and we had to go inside a computer to figure it out? Highly recommended.",1
76,"A Landmark For Visual EffectsThe Matrix is an absolutely astonishing, mythical, beautiful, memorable movie.",1
77,Best movie ever. Watched it like 20+ times and it is a must watch for everyone.,1
78,"Had high hopes for this one because everybody is saying it's a masterpiece, I was a bit disappointed.The concept is very interesting, but some too-Hollywoodish moments ruined the film.",1
79,"The reason that I started to watch films. It's one of the best films of all time that inspires us to think about ""Is this real world?"" Well made CGI and astonishing action sequences, great characters/villains, a masterpiece",1
80," The most visually stunning, psychologically astonishing, groundbreaking film the world has ever seen. It combines elements of philosophy, martial arts, and wonder to make a perfectly balanced and thrilling movie. Plus, it has a real cast of actors, including Keanu Reeves as Neo, Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus, and Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity. Even if you're not into kung fu fight scenes, this movie will still satisfy you with its wonder and philosophical elements. Some movies go overboard with special effects and fight scenes, but this one does not. It has a perfect balance of fight scenes and philosophical things. Note: You have to see this movie a few times before you really understand everything that is being said.",1

89," A fantastic film that is as creative as science-fiction films get. A great take on the ""What if"" question, and although the action is a bit over the top, it's supposed to be and it doesn't go too far. Makes you think and combines good use of colour, atmosphere and truly believable fear from some of the characters to make on of the best sci-fi films ever. Go buy it. It's just a shame the sequels were so bad.",1
90, Best movie Ive ever seen besides Braveheart. The fight scenes were amazing. Loved the rotating camera and slow motion effects. The story line was really good. Anyone that does not give this movie a ten obviously has bad taste in movies or just didn't really understand the movie!.,1
91, WOW! The special effects were amazing and the stunts in the movie were really cool and fun to watch.,1
92," Although difficult to understand at times, this action packed masterpiece brought together brilliant action sequences and fantastic filming to bring you a really great film.",1
93," This was billed as the action movie of the millennium. And it really was hard to argue with that. One of the best movies ever and the best sci-fi movie ever. With stunning set pieces and fight scenes, its a must see. A shame the third film was such drivel.",1
94," Its funny how some people give this movie a low rating. I don't think they fully understand the concept of a simulated reality. There are many actual scientific hypothesis regarding the subject, many of which seem extremely logical and involve Quantum Computers trying to calculate every possible combination and outcome of everything. Another considers the progression of technology and computer systems, and how they are already running complex simulations to help us decide the best course of action in many situations and where resources should be allocated. The matrix falls under the category of ""Brain-computer interface"" or ""direct neural interface"" and correlates directly with Neuroprosthetics which is an actual area of neuroscience. This is the first film to consider technologies impact on primitive culture, and the behavior which could result from direct technological integration into semi-intelligent organic life.",1
95," Gobsmacked all the way! This is a mile marker movie in the cinema time line. The cinematography is ground breaking and impressive - evidenced by how much it has been imitated. It is a movie for both Joe Six-pack and the philosopher at the same time. Joe S. will be satisfied with the Kung-Fu action and gun fighting expolosions, while the philosopher will scratch their chin with a new perspective on Descartes' Mind-Body problem. The kissy-kissy scene between Neo and Trinity is a bit hokey ... but I survived it and still left the theater slack-jawed. The next two movies in the trilogy do not follow this one very well. In fact, I think the trilogy is still incomplete. I am waiting for the next two...proper follow-ups.",1
96," Phenomenal don't believe any of the ratings under a 7, they're simply trying to keep you from being unplugged.",1
97," Great movie, one of my favorites. The ideas introduced in this movie were fascinating.",1
98,"This movie is one the top 10 of all time. Most of the movies out there never satisfied me very well but I think The Matrix is a masterpiece. I maybe do not agree with all the concepts in the movie but the story just makes you think about every aspect of your life again. Each time you watch this movie you will understand more of it. The most remarkable thing about The Matrix is, the directors have thought about every single scene in the movie and if you pay more attention you will find signs and symbols all over the places! Watch this movie more than once!",1

100,"...................................................................................................................................................................A Masterpiece movie of sci-fi & action, with a smart script...",1
101,"A mind-bending movie. The story of Neo, a computer hacker who learns that the entire world is simply a dream created by machines to keep human's minds occupied so they can be harvested for energy, is incredible, simply because one day it may actually happen. The fights are incredibly choreographed, and the special effects were revolutionary for their time, and still hold up today. Buckle up and prepare for The Matrix! (and its crappy sequels).",1
102,"Easily the best movies ever made. Amazing action and story, great acting, too. I don't want to spoil anything because this is too good, just watch it. You will crap your pants, at the sheer awesomeness. And don't forget all of the unforgettable lines like ""Not like this, not like this"" Watch this movie or I will find you, I will hurt you, then I will kill you.",1
103,"The late '90s were a period in film that saw a sudden resurgence in science fiction. The quickly approaching Y2K symbolised a time of transition, wonder, and technological advancement. Though these positives are reflected in The Matrix, it is mostly the negative aspects of the new millennium's dawn that it feeds upon. Paranoia, uncertainty, and fear are the themes that the film addresses like no other in Hollywood at the time, while simultaneously being action-packed and visually stunning. What The Matrix is perhaps most well known for, however, is its complex, engaging plot that almost any viewer can relate to. All of this is delivered with superb direction, making full use of subtle nuances and symbolism to embellish the story. The only misstep lies in the casting of Reeves, who is so painfully uncharismatic and distant in his performance that it's puzzling how he could ever be the chosen one of anything.",1
104,"The movie can be a bit confusing at times and hard to follow, but it all makes sense the further you dive into the movie. It's a great movie full of action and great effects. It isn't an ordinary movie in terms of the storyline and plot, but it is good. The twist through the middle is great, and it is another movie that can be watched over and over in my opinion. A fantastic movie that has added a tiny bit of sci-fi through it, without really involving aliens much, a great watch!",1
105,"Nowadays, you could ask someone what film defined the sic-fi genre and made it what it is today, there's a good chance the film on the lips of many would be The Matrix, the 1999 bombshell which inspired, split and certainly opened up debate for the masses, some called it ridiculous, others were boggled by its complex plot but many respected the achievement the film had, and for good reason. Without stripping the plot down piece by piece and explaining what is and what isn't, The Matrix works with the idea that the world as we know it is actually a dream, that we are actually ""plugged in"" to the real world which is run by machines, and that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the man to stop the war and give freedom back to the humans, this is what Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) believes, one of the captains of a resistance movement in the real world.Neo begins to learn the way of the Matrix, which can be summed up as the world we live in now, that it is actually a computer program created by the machines to control the populous.The Matrix itself, therefore, can be altered because it is a program, these people can walk on walls, slow down time and have quite an array of fighting skills, but its really when these parts come into play that the film starts to loose is unique touch and starts to conform, we have shootouts, running, typical villains and a sense of losing steam, the premise remains, but the action becomes bloated and apparently necessary. There is a vast array of characters, already mentioning Neo and Morpheus, we have Trinity, an experienced member of the crew and a love interest of Neo, we have also have Mr Smith, an agent of the Matrix intent on the destruction of the remaining human world, Zion. There are various other characters but they aren't widely used, the primary focus is the path that Neo must take, and the decisions he must make.We have the introduction of ""bullet time"" which of course is common ground now in Hollywood but its humble beginnings in the film will leave your jaw on the floor, the Watchowski brothers have utilised an intelligent, sometimes confusing plot but still manage to keep us up to date, while also showing some impressive effects and scenarios that will really have you questioning everything around you, if of course you keep an open mind.Certainly an interesting and dramatic tale, one which continues to stand the test of time with its remarkably risky script and its choice of lead roles, but while it can take a turn into familiar territory, there is still fresh and enjoyable fun to be had with The Matrix, it opens plenty of questions and begs the viewer to attempt a straight answer, and thats what getting engaged in a film is all about.",1
106,"The Wachowski Brothers' sci-fi actioner is primarily remembered for its distinctive aesthetic style and physics-defying action, but what makes The Matrix really stand out is its exceedingly creative exploration of some big philosophical themes, most notably concepts of reality and free will. These ideas are discussed through the film's dark and layered story premise that supposes humanity's research into artificial intelligence technology resulted in a machine rebellion and the near-total extinction of the human race, and the construction of an elaborate computer simulation dubbed ""The Matrix"" in order to keep the survivors enslaved. The plot leaves ample opportunity for flaunting plenty of eye-popping and complex action sequences, groundbreaking special effects, and for some quotes from the Wachowski's simple but effective script to become iconic. All the cast are strong, particularly Reeves, Weaving and the quite brilliant Joe Pantoliano, whose performance is complex, entertaining and full of subtle nuances. The best scenes in the film are Neo's training for survival within The Matrix, where essential skills are uploaded directly to his noggin, and his climactic fight with the film's primary antagonist, Agent Smith. As effective a blockbuster as The Matrix is, the strong religious overtones of certain elements of the plot can be a little hard to swallow when they become too blatant, and some of the supposedly intellectual concepts Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) attempts to explain to Neo, and by extension the viewer, sometimes sound like they have been lifted from a high school philosophy essay. Despite these little gripes, The Matrix is always fun, visually stunning and considerably more intelligent than the vast majority of modern big-budget science fiction films.The sequels never surpassed this first instalment on any terms, even with the mountains of cash that was piled onto the franchise, so remember this one with fondness, and perhaps forget the others, particularly Revolutions.",1
107,i absolutely loved the spectacular future vision! it must have taken quite the imagination to come up with such a future for our earth. the action is unmatched too.,1
108,"An intelligent and thrilling sci-fi spectacle. It has excellent visuals, intense Hong Kong action, and a potentially confusing and complex plot. The more you think about it, the more awesome it gets.",1
109,This is a good movie with some good actions. There are some flaws but in general this is a successful movie. I don't particularly like this movie that much myself but I would recommend seeing it.,1
110,"I don't really get why so many people have given this a bad score.The movie has flaws,such as the ridiculous stunts in some of the scenes,but that is really the concept of this movie.Something unreal,something out of the ordinary.The visual effects are stunning for a movie made in the 90s.The fighting scenes is what really keeps you interested in this movie,they are epic but also very entertaining.As said above,there are some weird movements in these scenes,where the actors defy gravity and such,but,as said above,that was the point of the movie.The acting was good,not great,but good.For an action movie where the acting isn't all that matters,the actors made a descent effort at making the scenes as realistic as they could get.In conclusion,this movie has everything you need for an action pack Saturday night.",1
111,"The Matrix generates success.A very well directed and fast paced action thrill ride with more gunfire than one could dream of. Besides being just a fun shoot 'em up The Matrix gives audiences mysterious characters and a solid plot.",1
112,This was an ok movie overall however didn't really explain all that much. I am happy that I am watching it now and not when before they all came out so i can watch all of them over a couple of days. Seeing as this is a movie filmed in 1999 the graphics are great and I cant wait to see the graphics in the other two movies. This is something I would watch again but not on its own.,1

If I want to watch martial arts I lather watch real martial arts match, martial arts in movies are fake.  I don't even like most gun battle movies like The A-Team, Knight and Day, Resident Evil. I only like gun battles from Metro 2033. It gives thrill because bullets are very limited. I only like the idea that people are in the computer world.",0

The first time I seen the special-effects however I was kind of ""Whoa - cool effects"" but it just gets old while the movie progresses and I went out of the cinema asking myself: ""So.. Did they talk anything else than: Neo - You're the chosen one."" For me The Matrix is like fast-food. Good for the masses but bad for those who seek quality. I surely won't watch it a second time especially since there are much better special effects out there nowadays which render this movie completely useless. Don't tell me it has a deeper meaning because there are probably 1000 books which have an alternate universe as topic and are less predictable. At the end I surely understand why ""The Counterstrike generation"" likes this movie so much though.",0
117," One of the worst movies of the last 10 years. Horrible acting by Reeves, a stupid script and an even dumber plot. Nothing more than a special effects display disguised as a movie.",0
118," Anyone who thinks this movie is great is an imbecile. Unfortunately, this country is rife with imbeciles. Okay, okay--this movie has some cool fx and some style, I suppose, but it also has some of the lamest fx ever printed to celluloid (e.g. the freeze, rotate effect). For the martial arts genre, this kind of style is the cat's meow, but, like most martial arts movies, the visuals can't overcome the shortcomings of the braindead plot. And that, my dear friends, is where ""2001"", with its late-60's fx, spanks ""The Matrix"" up one side of the street and back down the other. Thanks for trying. In closing, an earlier comment alluded to a comparison of ""The Matrix"" and ""Citizen Kane"". I'm still waiting for that comparison.",0
119," Only morons like this film. Ok, the principal concept is a good one, but that is completely ruined by an extremely poor script with appalling dialogue and ill-thought out story. One of my favourite worst lines is when Neo first sees a ""squiddy"" and asks what it is. The reply: ""It's a killing machine designed for only 1 thing"". (And what would that be, the viewer thinks, killing, per chance?) But, no! It is to ""Seek and destroy"". In case it needs pointing out, that's two things. You may think I'm being pedantic, but this is not an isolated example. It's full of bad lines and pathetic attempts to be all philosophical. Fans often say how ""thought provoking"" and ""deep"" it is. Can you actually say what thoughts it manages to provoke? The only thought it provoked in me was ""Why have I paid £5 to see this?"" And ""Ur an idiot if u hate this film"": I've READ Alice in Wonderland, not watched it (it was a book before it was a Disney cartoon, you know) and seen Akira many times. Studying Japanese culture will not make this absolute turd of a film any good. It's just extremely poor.",0
120," Resentable plot, dreadful characters, plot holes the size of France. A stupid, stupid film; it feels like some special fx with a rubbish plot tacked on.",0
123,"I was nearly bored to death during the first 90 mins of this movie. But the final escape and fight scenes were so outstanding that i couldn't even stop to breathe. If the whole of film were as exciting as the final part, then this would be the best movie i have ever watched...",1
124,"It's been over 10 years since I've seen the Matrix, and to be completely honest with you, back then, I didn't really get it the way I did this time. When the film was made it was a huge risk for the production company, as it was extremely expensive, and featured a first a time Director, using a new kind of computerized effects. 15 years later and the film is considered to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made. For those unfamiliar with the story, it takes place 200 years in the future, a time where machines have taken control of the planet and 99% of humans live in blissful ignorance, as pawns in stasis, living out there lives in a dreamworld called the Matrix. The other 1% know the truth and will do whatever it takes to defeat the machines. The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar leads the charge, following an ancient prophecy, that says they will one day discover a human with extraordinary abilities, that will lead to the destruction of the Matrix. That man is named Neo and is played by Keanu Reeves, in what many consider to be his crowning achievement. Reeves is often put down for being too dark and emotionless in his roles, but that is exactly what the role of Neo calls for, making Reeves the perfect choice to play him. Reeves is paired with veteran actor Laurence Fishburne, who as Morpheus, is like the pope of this new world. He is the one who discovered the prophecy and who risks everything for Neo. The story of the Matrix is one of the most original to come alone in decades, featuring a perfectly cast group of actors, who are aided by special effects, the likes of which had never been seen before. These effects are common place in 2014, but were unheard of in 1999, and really helped cement the reputation of this classic. The Matrix may not be the perfect movie and in fact, a lot of people won't understand it, but it's a film that people will be watching 200 years from now, when the events of the film supposedly take place.",1
125,"Though it is neither as original or as good as the average sci-fi fan would make it out to be, THe Matrix features a rather intelligent plot, eye-popping action sequences that will leave you satisfied.",1
126,"Enjoyable action with an original and well done plot that keeps you interested from start to finish. A little slow at times and the ending could have been better but overall, It's a pretty enjoyable film.",1
128,The matrix is an interesting and engaging action flick. It has a story line that really sucks you in and it has great cinematography and a great score. Through out the film there is a unique atmosphere that is maintained as well. The major problem with this film is the Keanu Reeves throughout the entire film is a very bland and monotone actor. Where all the other actors played their characters well Keanu seemed almost apathetic throughout the entire film. That aside overall the Matrix is very entertaining and luckily there are many action sequences were Keanu is on screen and doesn't have to talk.,1
129,"Well, this one was certainly unique. That is for sure. I was very skeptical heading into this one as I am not head over heels with Keanu Reeves and am not a fan of Laurence Fishburne at all, yet both turned in good performances. The plot is very complex, but once you wrap your head around it and begin to understand everything, it becomes very enjoyable and easy watching. In fact, it shocked me how straight forward it wound up being, as I expected it to be far more confounding. I am typically not a huge science fiction fan, but this one really wound up working for me and though the shoved in romantic elements bother me as always. On top of that, how it pretty much turns into an action film (especially towards the end) is another sour note here. However, as I said, it was still very enjoyable and very well done.",1
130,"I remember watching this when it came out and it was awesome. Don't get me wrong, there is ALLOT wrong with this movie: the acting, the disjointed & cryptic script, the needlessly over-the-top action scenes. Watching this movie recently I also noticed just how poorly the FX have aged too. BUT, I will admit, even though it has a high reading on the crap-o-meter, it's still entertaining as hell, as long as you leave your brain at the door and enjoy it at face value. Overall: Probably the greatest bad movie ever. King of the Junkyard .",1
131,"The Matrix has some outstanding action sequences, amazing fight scenes with just the use of hands and great cinematography, but I have to say, this film is insanely overrated. The whole love story was thrown onto you like a heavy bag of rice and the character introductions are rushed, and very messy. Sill, a very entertaining movie.",1
132,This is the most interesting and original action/drama I have seen in a long time! The special effects and the slo-mo looked astonishingly real. The acting and the development was great. The Wachowski siblings did a great job!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
133,"As far as special effects go, The Matrix was probably the most cutting edge thing seen in its time! However, as disappointed as I am to say this, the story started strong but dissolves to a jumbled up mess about half way through. This being said, the pay off in the end as far as acting and the story picking itself back up does make it worth watching!",1
134,"The Matrix is a thought-provoking movie that is the pioneer in slo-mo filmmaking, and has some really good CGI effects for it's time (except for that one scene where Keanu finishes all his enemies, we all signed an unspoken contract to forget about the CGI in that scene). But other than that, this movie was the first of its kind, and is just a really amazing film to experience.",1
135,One of my favorite sci-fi films of all times. It has incredible acting with really good graphics.The story it had was put together flawlessly. You can't make a science fiction film better than this.,0
136,"Well served by a terrific cast and some spot on action sequences, ""Matrix"" is a groundbreaking piece of cinema with the essence of pure entertainment.",1
140,"Hacker Neo (Reeves) is sought out to save the world. In order to do this he find out that his consciousness is part of a Matrix that keeps human bodies redendant and occupies their minds with a false reality. Is he ""The One"" to save humanity from destruction? What sounds like some web freak's wet dream is, in fact, a dazzlingly nifty slice of sci-fi cool. The Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry - last seen dabbling in kinky lesbian noir with the excellent Bound) pulling off something like a million masterstrokes all at once. Taking the imprimatur of the video game, they meld the grungy noir of Blade Runner, the hyperkinetic energies of chopsocky, John Woo hardware and grandiose spiritual overtones into William Gibson's cyberpunk ethos to produce a new aesthetic for the millennium powered to the thudding beat of techno. And it is just incredible fun. The key is the technique of ""flo-mo"", a process born from Japanese animation, whereby an object in motion is seemingly frozen while the camera miraculously spins around it as if time and gravity are on hold. It grants the action (including some killer kung fu which Reeves and crew spent months perfecting) liberty to take on surreal visual highs. Superhuman feats permissible, of course, in the context of VR as the rebels download Herculean ""talents"" to fuel their subterfuge. Meanwhile, the audience can only gawp longingly, with its jaws thunking to the cinema floor in unison, as the heroes wrapped in skintight leather, sleek shades and designer cheekbones, spin up walls, leap from high rises and slip through streams of bullets in silken slo-mo. Tron this ain't. The deliciously inventive Wachowskis have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool. However, as much as i love this film just the thought of the sequels prevent this from my VERY RARE perfect 10 score. Sorry.",1
141,"There's no sophomore jinx for the Wachowski Brothers. Andy and Larry, a pair of obviously talented film makers, have returned to theaters with The Matrix, a science fiction thriller that is every bit the match of their debut effort, Bound, for tension, excitement, and intelligence. In an era when movie scripts (especially those pigeonholed into the science fiction genre) are becoming increasingly more stupid and special effects reliant, the Wachowskis prove that style and substance do not have to be mutually exclusive. I loved The Matrix, and only a few minor contrivances associated with the climax caused the film to miss a 10/10 rating. The movie is kinetic, atmospheric, visually stunning, and mind-bending. It toys with the boundaries between reality and fantasy in unique and interesting ways. In its approach and content, it reminded me of last year's vastly underrated Dark City. There's also a synergy with two movies due to be released within the next month: David Cronenberg's eXistenZ and Alejandro Amenabar's Open Your Eyes. The Matrix is undeniably science fiction, but, unlike most pictures claiming that association, it never falls into the boring, expected patterns of space battles and laser gun shoot-outs. Instead, it ventures into territory that, while not virgin, is sufficiently interesting to provide an involving, invigorating backdrop. Stylistically, The Matrix is much like Bound. Both films are visually stunning, with images painstakingly constructed and action sequences choreographed to excite the eye and quicken the pulse. The Wachowskis use a varied pallette that includes shadows, slow motion, quick cuts, and offbeat humor to paint a unique portrait. Like in Dark City, theirs is a grim world, where darkness and gloom seemingly always hold sway. Everything from the set design to the costumes (lots of black, lots of sunglasses) is intended to contribute to an overall look. When it comes to shoot-outs, the Wachowskis show that John Woo isn't the only director capable of doing interesting things with familiar devices. The shots of Keanu Reeves streaking down a hall with guns blazing all around him and the air thick with shattered bits of concrete is only one of many snapshots that lingers in the mind's eye long after they have vanished from the screen. The special effects, which are not as numerous as those in many science fiction pieces, are flawless. Keanu Reeves is not generally regarded as a strong actor, but, given the right part - one that doesn't demand much subtlety or emoting - he can be effective. His role as Neo fits the criteria. The Matrix needs a leading man who can look good, act cool, and not stumble over his dialogue, and Reeves is three for three. It's easily his best work since Speed, where the same kinds of demands were made of him. For more nuanced performances, the Wachowskis rely on the rest of the cast: the always excellent Laurence Fishburne, brilliant character actor Joe Pantoliano (who appeared in Bound), and Carrie-Anne Moss, who looks great in black leather. Aussie Hugo Weaving (Proof) brings the perfect mix of dry wit and menace to his role as the head Man in Black. The Matrix offers a little something for everyone. The die-hard science fiction fan will discover a plot that mixes and matches both new and old conventions of the genre in a compelling fashion. Action aficionados will find that there's no shortage of electric excitement, whether it's in the form of hand-to-hand kung fu-type fights or shoot-outs with seemingly limitless ammunition. There's also betrayal, a little romance, some humor, and a moral dilemma or two, all wrapped into a well-produced package. As I stated earlier, the way in which the Wachowskis choose to resolve everything seems slightly contrived, but, in the overall scheme of things, that's a small price to pay for one of the most enjoyable science fiction thrillers to reach the screen in months.",1

Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion",1

Though there are some sequences that look just a bit dated with the use of earlier CGI, this film still holds its own because the emphasis for SVFX at the time this was made was put on practical effects and NOT CGI. The final, climactic third act looks absolutely stunning still! This is a very layered story and world, and each time I have watched it I've gotten more and more out of it. There's a perfect relationship between the themes of fate and destiny + the existence of free will; Neo does not become, ""The One,"" until HE chooses to do remarkable things in desperate times. He does not become, ""The One,"" until Trinity chooses to express her love for him. He does not become, ""The One"" until he chooses to believe in himself.",1

150,"A man's life has changed arguably for the better after finding out about the world he lives in and discovering that he is more than just an everyday man who works at a dead end job. 'The Matrix' is an expansive, dazzling and sometimes philosophical science-fiction thriller that develops its worlds and characters with discovery as opposed to long exposition explained by characters. The movie follows the life of a man named Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) who gets mysterious conversations from the people of ""The Real World"", he often gets phone calls from a man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who tells him that the world he is currently living in is a fake and that it's just an illusion. Thomas, reluctantly, follows everything Morpheus tells him to do, and runs into the hands of an evil Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) who tries to convince Thomas otherwise. Morpheus then tells him to meet the other crew which involves a woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) who also tells him that the current world he is living in is fake and is often referred to as ""The Matrix"". When Thomas enters the real world, and finally ""wakes up"" and sees that the world he was living in really was fake, he needs questions to be answered, and Morpheus provides him with that as well as training him to handle himself for whenever he enters the Matrix. The film, directed by the Wachowskis, is stunning to look at, filled with fantastic fight choreography, and good character development, even if some of the exposition feels a bit heavy-handed. Like George Lucas' 'Star Wars' (1977), it is original, groundbreaking and filled with great storytelling with characters who become iconic, and some innovative action scenes. If you love Sci-Fi... this might be something you're looking for.",1

The writing could use a little work, but the philosophy and metaphors are spot on and suck in the viewer to the movie's universe. The visual effects pushed the industry limits at the time and still hold up to today's standards. I'd recommend this to everyone who enjoys movies, its a movie that can stand as a base line in comparing other sci fi movies.",1
164,"First of all, the fight scenes in this film are original and outstanding to watch. From the camera work to the wire work before this film, nothing had been done like this in film before. Also, all the actors trained hard so that most of the time it’s them and not a stunt double which helps with the realism of the situation. The set design and cinematography is well chosen for each location so you fully understand where you are. From having green lighting when in the matrix to blue in the real world helps the viewer to understand the difference between the real world and the matrix. Also the set design and how the real world looks disgusting compared to the real world which looks amazing and way better. This film came out in 1999 and honestly the special effects in this film look way better than some nowadays. The special effects help convince the viewer how the real world is now a dystopian wasteland while shots that took place in the matrix was filmed on location. The acting in this film done by everybody was well cast for their roles and you can easily tell everybody was having a good time and gave it they're all. Nobody feels like they are dragging down this movie and that everybody has a part that is important to the film. But the main four actors you can obviously see they are giving it their all. Whether it be Keanu Reeves playing the main hero or Hugo Weaving playing the main villain you can easily see the character and not the actor. The character growth for Neo and Trinity from the start of the film to the end is there and is amazing to see. The pacing in this film is spectacular and you never feel like anything is slowing the film down. In the end, The Matrix is a classic film that everybody should check out at least once in their life.",1
165,This movie had the magic and like Total Recall keeps you guess about what is reality which was the hard core awesome aprt of the movie.   The fighting an cyber stuff is ncie but a bit anti white minorityish with so many black people and that gets worse in 2 n 3.   The interesting part is nto social justice but the idea you don't know whos controlling and what si dream and who to trust.  If they had stuck witht he mystery part might have been one of the great trilogies ever.  Hllywood you need idaes not stupid monster n explosion!!  YEs have the action!!  Also they steer way clear of a guy ever cloning 10 hot women.  That would be the real weapon of the matrix.,1
166,You can't say anything bad about this masterpiece of a movie.I can't believe the critic score is only at a 71! Honestly can't name a movie better than The Matrix,1
167,"Not only this movie is a kind of a solid element among the classics of sci-fi genre and considered a must-see for a lot of reasons, what I can agree with is that this movie is to make you think, even when it's been a whole while after you seen it; this will stay in your head. It is the topic, the idea, yeah, I call it philosophy behind THE MATRIX. That one thought everything we call our ""reality"" could for real be fake, nothing more than a simulation being projected into our heads is at the same time insanely fascinating and extraordinary frightening.It's a thesis already know to modern science and in the Matrix it's very well expressed, wrapped into an interesting fassade, which is obscure enough to make it exiting and clear enough to not get you lost in confusion. It's exciting, overwhelming and keeps you hooked until the ending. Also the visual effects, the music and certain scenarios are characteristic and will ever be associated with what The Matrix is. The only reason for me not rating it all 10 points is that as a movie itself, when leaving the message and the idea behind it aside for a second, this was nothing to blow me off. There was nothing very much not being seen among elsewhere within the genre and the plot development isn't any special either. So as I said, if you are into philosophy, this is one of the movies to watch. For a genre enthusiast The Matrix is a solid expereince, which is worth watching, but probably not very astonishing.",1

The action is great and the slow motion looks great, especially for the time that it was made. This is a very thought provoking and amazing film. My rating would be 9.4/10",1

The superb execution of a brilliant story concept was good enough to take me by surprise, and this is not easy for any movie to do -- most all film plots are very predictable.  But the Matrix completely blindsided me when Neo woke up in that pod, I just didn't see it coming.The special effects and fights could all be dispensed with, it's that core concept and story line that are so powerful and haunting.  In the end, there's an uncomfortable similarity to our own Matrix-like experience in our work cubicles every day -- staring at computer screens -- being anonymous production units in a huge organization.  We're not actually generating electricity, but something even more insidious -- our very brainpower and life energies are enslaved in our version of the Matrix, as our muscles atrophy.  Eerily similar.  But how can we waken from our Matrix?  Will love save us, as it saved Neo?  Whether it intended to or not, this film makes us confront the fundamental values and experiences of the human species in an increasingly cybernetic world.  And for that, it rises beyond entertainment, to the level of chilling prophecy.",1

I was young when it debuted, but I remember the impact it had and there is no doubt that it left marks.I will not dwell on describing the story. I just want to say that I find it interesting the way it was developed. It's a good story and it keeps our interest until the end. The weakest part is the romantic plot of Neo and Trinity because the two characters never have any chemistry in the movie. In fact, the movie did not ask for romance. That was the biggest mistake of this movie. The characters have no humanity and look like machines most of the time ... The outfit, with those dark glasses until night and wearing clothes in various shades of black (I loved the cassock they got for Reeves, he could think of being priest if he ever gets tired of being an actor) gives the final touch. It's called ""style"".Keanu Reeves is perfect for his character. He is one of those actors I hate because of his lack of dramatic expressiveness, here as in other films he has made. I've seen asses more expressive than his face, sorry for the words but it's the truth. In this movie, he hardly even moves facial muscles. And the other actors (Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss especially) follow the same path. It's called ""style""! Luckily for everyone involved, the movie asked for this and it works well on the screen. Fishburne, especially, looks amazing. This is one of his best movies to date, in my opinion.The production values are extraordinary. In addition to a great soundtrack, we have great special visual and sound effects. Cinematography is one of the best and best achieved I've ever seen in sci-fi movies, and that's no small feat. The camera and film work is excellent.Okay, I may look a little rough, but I actually liked the movie. The biggest problem (and also one of its most striking features) is having so much ""style"". Not being a perfect movie, it has cleverly invested in creating a style of its own. Very superlative, here there is permission, even advantage, in overcoming the barriers of credibility and logic. There is no problem in that guy looking like a dancer when he fights. If it looks amazing on the screen, the film allows it, the film wants it. It's not about reality, it's about looking cool. And the film seems cool all the time, to the point that it is sometimes funny. It is no coincidence that the film yielded so many internet memes and humorous parodies.",1
178,"Melhor filme de todos, excelente história e cenas de ação, recomendo assistir muito.",1
179,"My type of movie with amazing action scenes, a story you never heard before and top top cgi",1
180,"Action movies have never been so pretentious and filled with double meanings. For the fact that it combines an excellent story, a cool action and, to some extent, made revolutions in the cinema, it is worth respect and be seeing at least once in your life.",1
181,"Mostly remembered for its distinctive use of slo-mo style and physics-defying action, but what makes The Matrix really stand out, at least for me, is its extremely innovative exploration of some philosophical questions and ideas. These themes are discussed through the movie's layered story premise, but they are explored by The Wachowskis' directorial vision.There are many great Sci-Fi/Action movies that earned their place among the best of their kind because how profound the thoughts and how interesting theories they are explore, but this is not the case here. The Matrix is one of the best thought-provoking Sci-fi movies simply because of the direction. There is no doubt that the fact we get information bit by bit made the movie so intriguing, but the main reason this movie is so exciting is because how little it offers by showing us, not by telling us. And here is the best thing about The Wachowskis' direction, that it created a world that, for the lack of a better word, broke the limits and pushed the boundaries for its story. The result is what seems to be implausible and nonsensical, made all the sense in the world.Unfortunately, I hoped the movie relies on its creative visuals even more to explain its ideas. Because the rest explanations are displayed in a very unsubtle and direct way. For example, some of the intellectual concepts Morpheus attempts to explain to Neo often feel like they have been lifted from a philosophy essay or something like this. So there are a lot of exposition that could have been easily ignored, and replaced by some visual explanations, the very thing that happened a couple of times in the movie.In Addition, sometimes I felt that the philosophical themes are a bit repetitive, and they didn't have any right to be so. In my opinion, this happened because the direction, for all its advantages, is occasionally ostentatious. I've also the same issue with Marvel's Dr. Strange.It goes without saying that The Matrix has some of the most dazzling and imaginative action set-pieces ever put to film. Although, it's not the most thing I was impressed by, and therefore not what made me love this movie, I have to admit that the groundbreaking action in The Matrix is what made the movie timeless. As it's as creative as it's unprecedented. That's also due to the unlimited world that has been created by The Wachowskis' revolutionary vision. What we got is some of the most memorable scenes in cinema history that deserve every bit of the expression ""often imitated, never duplicated"".Surprisingly, the movie's wonderfulness doesn't stop at its philosophy or the exploration of it, neither stop at its breathtaking action. The movie also reutilized some of the clichés and tropes that are often found in action movies, and sometimes also in classic fantasy movies! And I can't describe how exceptionally clever they are utilized in the movie, particularly in the astonishing final act.There is no need to talk about the acting. For all the cast gave great hammy, yet charismatic performances that perfectly matches the movie's distinguish tone. Keanu Reeves played Neo, the role that was the turning point in his career. Both Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss have some of the most intense and emotional moments in the movie that showed some of their terrific acting abilities. Hugo Weaving portrayed one of the most popular villains in cinema, Agent Smith. The rest of the cast who played less important roles are very good, especially Marcus Chong as Tank. I loved his acting so much, and he made me somehow feel I was watching an Alien movie. I don't know why, but that's what I felt!Another great thing about The Matrix, and one of the factors that made it stands the test of time, is the ageless special effects. The visual effects are utterly stunning. In large part because of how intelligent they are used not just because how stellar they look. The sound effects are equally brilliant and game-changing.More intelligent and creative than the vast majority of modern big-budget science fiction films, and more impressive and enjoyable than the vast majority of modern big-budget action films. The Matrix is an outstanding achievement in almost every aspect. And an immortal classic that deserves every bit of recognition it got.(8/10)",1
183,"This isn't my favorite film, however I expected much less from it. It has some of the best action scenes of all time, memorable characters and very good acting. My only issue with the film are the scenes after the opening scene are boring and that it has a fine collection of cliches. You should check it out.",1
184,"An intelligent and thrilling sci-fi spectacle. It has excellent visuals, intense kung fu action, and an extremely inventive and intricate plot. The more you think about it, the more awesome it gets.",1
185,My score 100Metascore / User score 73 / 90Tomatometer / Audience score 87 / 85IMDB 87(87),1
186,The concept of The Matrix blow my mind. Who could imagine we live in the computer codes.,1
187,"This movie is the **** This single handedly is one of my favorite movies of all time, as well as one of the best movies of all time! The Wachowski Brothers,have crafted a Movie that manages to challenge the brain, whille also making a fun movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat every second. The score, The action, The Acting, Its all executed so great and it deserves a 9/10 from me!",1
188,"Fun, well written and philosophical. I enjoyed it all the way trough. A Classic",1
189,The movie didn´t aged very well since its initial release with a poor and confusing plot as well as substandard special effects and lackluster visuals.Also i nominated Laurence Fishburne that interpretates Morfeo character as one of the worst actors in the movie history.,0
190,"Really great film.Besides the kinetic, massively entertaining action sequences and the groundbreaking visual effects, ""The Matrix"" also boasts an interesting social commentary on ""fate vs free will"". Not heavy-handed, for sure. Keanu Reeves delivers a good performance for the most part and Hugo Weaving is awesome as Agent Smith.Enjoyed the hell out of it.8/10.",1
191,"I so enjoyed this movie.  Original idea executed perfectly, great casting all around.",1
192,"The best of the trilogy. Absolutely marvelous and genius movie. A true revolution and mind blowing story.If you have never watched this movie, you are missing something huge.",1
193,"Obra prima do seculo XX!Matrix é um filme completo, e sem sombra de duvidas, um dos melhores sci-fi já feitos. Podemos até dizer que havia um mundo sem Matrix e com Matrix, de tão revolucionário que é.Primeiro começamos com o enredo, que não apenas trata-se claramente de uma metáfora para a sociedade contemporânea, como também adentra para problemas que podem ser uma realidade daqui há um tempo, trazendo questionamentos pertinentes até hoje - ou melhor, ainda mais hoje. O filme conta com algumas frases de efeito, que tem sua profundidade, o que pode ser contraditório tendo em vista a não ""fixação"", só que ,na realidade, o filme faz isso, só que em segundo plano. Os diálogos, de forma geral, são interessantíssimos, e muitas vezes nos vemos se pondo no lugar do Neo e imaginando nossa própria reação ao descobrir tudo aquilo.Os personagens também são legais, mas nesse primeiro filme, não são muito aprofundados, voltando mais a atenção para Neo, Mortheus, Trinity e o Agente.A cenas de ação em SlowMotion desse filme ""simplesmente"" mudaram o cinema pra sempre, inspirado não apenas filmes, como jogos e series/animes. Os efeitos, pra época, eram muito bem feitos, e até hoje são aceitáveis pra qualquer pessoa com um senso. A trilha sonora é marcante, tanto que é muito provável que você já tenha escutado ""Clubbed To Death"" mesmo sem saber da existência do filme - o que, convenhamos, não é muito fácil.Ela também se torna presente nas cenas de ação, faz seu trabalho e apenas acrescenta. Adentrando no quesito áudio, o estéreo do filme foi muito bem utilizado em algumas cenas, como quando as capsulas dos projeteis caem no chão.As interpretações são boas de forma geral, com um claro destaque a Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne e Hugo Weaving, quais sou fan de carteirinha!",1
194,A now classic film that has aged incredibly well. Sterling performances from Reeves and Fishburne.,1
195,"I am currently reading ""Homo Deus"" from Yuval Noah Harari. And I have read there something about human being vs robot fight and end of the human race somehow. But now I have finished to watch this ""The Matrix"" film which was about the topic. Can`t imagine my feelings now and when I was watching and compare this feelings with the time when reading the book. Just wow! Pure wow! I loved this so much! I used to always think about pure intelligence and pure emotional life together in an ideal life. The end of this film helps me imagine this togetherness one more time like I did in the past years... Love it! 10/10!",1
196,Matrix has aged well with great sci fi and action elements.The martial arts are well displayed on this film which takes inspiration of the martial arts films in Hong Kong and China. Matrix doesn't have **** cgi which some may think since this film is from the 90s. Overall great film.,1
197,"The person below doesn't like good movies. The matrix is a landmark film that ""a bit cheezy at times"" never stops to keep entertaining",1
198,Such a philosopher Sci-fi film with insane graphics for 1999 and even for 2020 and great actorsWho doesn't love this movie??????Best movie of 1999,1
199,"The first time I ever watched this movie was on a local channel, maybe two or three years after its release. I was stunned by the visual effects, yet very confused by the plot and the dialogue. This was before we even had Internet access in Egypt. Some years later, fortunately, my brother read the first expalnation of the story online. Once everything became clear, I watched the movie again with the intention of grasping every minute detail; I even read whole parts of the script--this what I also did with 'Fight Club'. Till mow every time I watch the movie I feel that I live in this world, which is controlled by the machines,and I'm one of the story characters who's trying to free humans from slavery. Yes, I can say this movie is my escape from reality--just like the mesmerizing Harry Potter movies. Sometime I feel that the Matrix could be a reality, which could be considered by some people as a bit much, or even crazy, but some things around us allude to this idea. For examples, dreams, and not being able to decide whether you're awake or not, the dream is real or just a dream: the chemicals inside your brain make you believe the dream is a reality.  I can positively say, the Matrix is one of the best science-fiction movies I've ever seen. It surpasses every movie in every aspect: the characters, the camerawork, the visual effects, and again, the plot. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction as much as I do.",1
200,One of the most important movie of the year 1999. This is movie is an out of the world experience.,1
201,Любимый фильм в жанре фантастики. Классная идея + качественная реализация = шедевр. имхо,1
202,"It is really good, a really intelligent and creative idea that felt incredibly well-executed, with the only problem being the whole chosen one narrative who felt kind of weird in this scenario.",1
203,"The Matrix, despite being well-acted, relies too much on silly action sequences to actually tell a compelling/powerful story. Take the ""not seeing this movie"" pill.",0
204,"This is the best movie I've ever seen by far. The story, the characters, the action, the special effects, just perfect.",1
205,"The Matrix is a game changer. The acting is perfect, the plot is fascinating while being clever and the special effects are jaw dropping. Easily in my top 10 movies of all time, bravo Wachowski brothers.",1
206,"One of the greatest movies and influence on pop culture of all time. For its genre, it’s a perfect movie.",1
207,"I went into this movie expecting an overrated, underwhelming, dull action flop, but in the end, I was left with my mind blown. It’s not a perfect film, but it’s an instant sci-fi classic. The effects are legendary, the premise is mind bending, the casting was great, I just love this movie. Better than Star Wars.",1
208,An incredible fiction film. Very interesting the philosophical aspects a film that marked the 90s,1
209,"Amazing on so many levels, the movie endures the test of time not only due to its gripping story and vision, but also to its visual wizardry. Visually, certainly one of the most breathtaking films ever, on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey.",1
210,"This movie is just amazing from start to finish, what a ride. This movie has got some amazing camera shots from it being under the bridge while it's raining and they do really well with the certain colours they've picked. Also, the actors in this movie are just amazing and Neo (Keanu Reeves) is just phenomenal in this movie he does really well for what he is given. Finally, the fight scenes in this movie are quite fun and cool but the effects can be shown to be quite outdated but overall it's still a brilliant movie, holy ****",1
211,"This review is 21 years after release, but there is still a lot to love about this movie. Serious Keanu Reeves! Bullet time! Action galore! High concept narrative! Laurence Fishburne! And all of those things should be rightly adored. The Matrix, still to this day, challenges filmmakers to get creative and original, to make something that gets people to think. The cinematography also deserves mention. Using green hues and tints while in the Matrix and blue borders in the real world is extremely well done. The Wachowskis put tons of thought into every shot of this movie, and it shows! The world building is top notch and leaves fans wanting to returns and hear how Neo fares in leading mankind to salvation.I also find the biblical imagery staggering. It is interesting that Zion is the last haven for mankind and that the ship is Nebuchadnezzar and that the woman who loves Neo is Trinity. There's a lot there to unpack that I think adds an even deeper level of thought to watching this series. Overall, I love the Matrix. I love Keanu's performance, especially, and I love to hate Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, although I prefer him as a good guy like Elrond. Still, he's fantastic. My only wish is that the other two movies lived up to the bar that this one set!",1
