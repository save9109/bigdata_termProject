0,"""Boring (Two Hours that Feel Like Two Weeks- the movie is too LOOOONG), Derivative (The Story of O and 9 1/2 Weeks both did it much better, and with a better-looking cast, if this S & M genre is your thing) and Embarrassingly Stupid, 50SOG is Dreck for Those Whose Brains Have Been Scooped Out"" You would have had to have your brain scooped out to buy into the absurd premise that this boring, monotonous, derivative, cheesy-porno dreck has anything to do with love, or even satisfactory coupling.  If you manage to make it through the movie without nodding off at the tedium or just cutting your losses and leaving early, you will understand why the distributors and their media enablers had to promote the heck out of this dog to get people into the theatres. The record that 50SOG should be setting is ""the year's biggest gotcha."" What a bunch of hype for a zero of a movie. The thin storyline is nothing new. To reduce it to its basics and give nothing away that you probably have not already surmised just from the trailer and the heavy hype leading up to its release:  Sicko beats up Flavor of the Moment and she pretends to enjoy it in exchange for access to Sicko's money and trappings, natch.  Charming, huh?  A romantic Valentine story?  Not and not. Tinsel Town has reached another low in this stinker of a movie with its fake flagellations, man-on-woman violence and gratuitous sex.  About the best that can be said is that at least you get to sit in a theatre seat out of the winter cold for two hours, and you do have two hours of escapism where you do not have to consider the day's beheadings by the Islamic terrorists steadily expanding their already-New Hampshire-sized territory. 50SOG is pretty much devoid of imagination:  If this S & M genre is your thing, the oldie The Story of O, or even 9 1/2 Weeks, is not as tedious as this movie is, and those casts are better-looking and better actors.  Older filmgoers might also vaguely equate the lack of merit in 50SOG with the icky, degrading Last Tango in Paris:  Maria, the butter.  Ana baby, the whip.  Hollywood cannot seem to ""discipline"" itself to avoid these irresponsible and degrading themes. Obviously, 50SOG is unapologetically anti-woman and pro-sexual-violence, and generations of women with any sense of history or context (and critical thinking skills surpassing those of a second grader - and let us not forget that most second graders would have a keener sense of stranger danger than apparently the stupid Ana does) are hurling in their popcorn to think that any moviegoers, particularly the confused women who have fueled the success of this dud in both book and now movie form, mistake sexual assault and battery with love, romance or satisfactory coupling.  Sexual abuse is not love.  Abuse is not cute, not clever, not cool, not fun, not funny, not entertaining.  Abuse is sick and an offense.  Where is the PC Police when you really need them? The US film industry must be pretty dead, too, if Melanie Griffith's daughter could not get better work than this merde, given her connections. Bottom line, as is obvious from my opinion as expressed in this review, and which also seems to be the 186 to 132 majority view of reviewers on this thread:  Save your time and money for a good movie, as 50SOG stinks.  About the only reason to waste your time with this dog is if it is a cold day and you need a place to get in out of the elements for two (long) hours and you only have $14 in your pocket.  Otherwise, stay clear.- La Mer Rating: One half of one star out of five stars.",0
1,"I've watched this with my wife on Valentine's Day:My score: 0 - Nothing to see here...Her score: 4 - He liked some BDSM actions, but film was boring So we are giving it 2.",0
2,"Boring. The movie is about sex. BDSM. It seemed like the creators only wanted to dwell upon that, but unfortunately had to create some background story, because you don't get directly to sex, you get porno if you do. So all the plot is extremely weak and its only purpose is to provide the terms for sex. Characters behave unrealisticaly, they do unreasonable and random stuff, they get horny by looking and each other lips etc.You might think ""Well, I bet at least the sex scenes themselves are cool"". No, they are not. They are neither appealing, nor horryfying, nor passionate. They are lame and boring. The deep breathing, fist clenching, shouting etc. seem out of place for there is no real cause for them.And it gets more and more random. During one of the final scenes which were supposed to be extremely dramatic and make viewers cry the entire cinema hall started to clap and burst into laughs because what was happenning on the screen was random, illogical and simply stupid.",0
3,I was embarrassed I forced my date to see this terrible movie.  It turned both of us off  rather than being an exciting and liberating sexual movie. I spent the rest of the day apologizing and distancing myself from the choice.,0
4,"A wanna be softcore/pinku movie that every women who read the book will definitely enjoy.WTF is wrong with hollywood these days. Don't tell me that this piece of trash is going to have a sequel.",0
5,"50 Shades of DisturbingI did not read the book. This is a porno horror movie dressed up like a glossy fashion magazine. As it was hyped by the media and released for Valentine's Day, I expected steamy, playful sex games...I was wrong. The young woman is a wide-eyed innocent. She is drawn to a handsome, well-dressed man who, despite brief flashes of whimsy or vulnerability, slowly reveals himself to be a brutal monster. This film glamorizes violence toward, and exploitation of women. If any of the young women or men lined up to see this film come away thinking that inflicting pain on another person is sexy, it will be a very sad outcome from all this gratuitous promotion of an ugly film dressed up to look pretty.",0
6,"Don't let the popularity and advertisement of this film fool you, because this film is bad. It's not even bad - it's atrocious. With little 'erotic' behavior and a whole lot of caked over domestic violence, this movie is not only bad in the sense of story and bad acting, but teaches women to stay in abusive relationships. How this isn't seen as a sin I have no clue, but do not give in to seeing this movie.",0
7,"This movie is just TERRIBLE. For a movie about BDSM, there sure isn't much of it. Better off watching 50 minutes of Sasha Grey instead with your significant other.",0
8,"If you like porn, go see the movie. But if you like good screen writing, acting, and good storytelling, don't bother. Here, everything just executes to a poor level. It seems to me like they focused on putting effort on the sex scene rather then the movie. And what do you learn at the end of it all? HEY GIRLS, IT'S OK TO BE IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP! (So yeah, I'm pretty sure this sums to a pretty bad movie)",0
9,"A lack chemistry, and poor writing and directing, hamper a lot of films.  Ultimately, what ruins Fifty Shades of Grey is how it belies its own edgy reputation by playing it safe.  It doesn’t go dark enough with Christian’s sexual addiction for fear of alienating the suburban soccer moms who made it acceptable to talk about bondage at bunco night, nor does it go sexually far enough for fear of turning its R-rating into an NC-17, a financial kiss of death. Grey might be a color associated with steely control, but it’s also associated with being dull, and fifty shades of that isn’t worth two hours of your time.",0
10,"Fifty Shades Of Grey had already become a huge thing before it came out. Same can be said for the weird sexual book by E.L James. Okay, Jamie Dornan was good as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson was HOT. But the movie is very odd, the sex scenes are cut down so much, that it reaches the R rated level. The story confused me, part of Christian likes Anastacia,  but part of him doesnt. The movie was LOONG, it held barely any of my attention for 2 hours and 2 minutes. FSOG is a boring movie, it is an erotica that fails on its premise. This is a dissapointing adaptation,  that fans will surely have some fun with, but not be totally satisfied.",0
11,It is obviously the worst piece of crap ever. Nothing else to say but this thing demands at least 150 characters so there you go. I managed to make a more interesting comment than that movie.,0
12,"A middle aged wifeys mid life crisis galore of their old sexual desires. I remember seeing a few parts from the book and it was terribly written! Only reason people liked it was because it was dirty. That's obviously the only reason people will want to see this. Ana is totally one dimensional and Mr Grey is actually kind of an **** and i feel like it's a cash grab due to the book selling so well to middle aged wifeys. Also, the film doesn't really seem erotic but almost glorifies sexual violence as a pleasure. I can imagine many females almost being offended by this and i as a male believe it is wrong to show as the main theme of the film almost. I know it's in other films but they never glorify in it and usually it's only a scenes worth in other films. This film is based around it. Awful.",0
13,"Just finished watching Fifty Shades of Grey and I gotta say... the film was beautiful. Yes, I am using the word beautiful to describe this movie. I went into the theater completely prepared to be embarrassed because of how graphic it was supposed to be, but I was extremely surprised by how I actually felt. I watched all of the scenes that were made available and thought that it all seemed a bit awkward, but it was only because there was no background music or noise. Watching the actual scenes in the movie was a whole other experience.The movie is getting a really bad rep because of the bad writing and graphic scenes that are in the book that it is based on. However, the movie is not just a ""sex movie"" like everyone says. It's pretty hilarious and romantic. The sex scenes were extremely dialed down and they all served a purpose. If you thought the pointless sex in The Wolf of Wall Street was acceptable, then you would be more than okay with the content in this Fifty Shades. Before I watched Fifty Shades of Grey, I watched a lot of interviews with the cast of the film and was confused as to how they could possibly describe the sex scenes as being classy and elegant. But then again, all I had to compare it to were scenes from Game of Thrones, True Blood, The Wolf of Wall Street, etc... After watching this film, I can honestly say that I completely agree with the cast. There was nothing ""dirty"" or ""wrong"" about what I was seeing on the screen. Sam Taylor-Johnson, the director, did an excellent job with this movie. She made it very tasteful and easier to accept. This film could have gone in a very bad direction, but thank god it didn't.For those of you that think that this movie is glorifying abusive relationships, think again because I think that it actually empowers women. I'm sure that you can argue, with quotes from the book, that I'm wrong, but there are many differences between the film and the book. Let me remind all of you that the book is a little over 500 pages and the movie is only about 2 hours long. Obviously, they had to cut a lot of things out, including the blue string scene that I'm sure a lot of people are aware of. In my opinion, they cut out many of the scenes that were considered controversial. I watched the movie looking for signs of an abusive relationship, but I really didn’t see anything of that nature. In fact, all I saw was this confident and empowered woman that made all of her own decisions. She was not forced to do anything that she didn’t want to do. She wanted to explore Christian’s dark world and her own sexuality. You can argue that Christian abuses her physically and emotionally, but he does what she tells him to do. When she says stop… he stops. He tries to give her what she wants.Moving on to something lighter, the comedy in this movie is on point! There were many “laugh-out-loud” moments that gave the movie a lighter mood. Those scenes were there to show that Christian and Ana’s relationship was not all dark and serious. I mean they are both young people in their twenties that should be having fun!Dakota Johnson gave a phenomenal performance and did everything right! She was confident, awkward, shy, and funny all at the same time. Jamie Dornan also did an amazing job as Christian Grey. They had great chemistry.I guess what I’m trying to say is that you should give the movie a chance. If you hate the book, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you will hate the movie. I have read many reviews, written by skeptics, saying that they ended up loving it. Don’t let the bad reviews or even the book itself stop you from seeing the movie. I was not disappointed at all with the finished product, even though they cut out a few scenes that I loved. It is perfect just the way it is.(I apologize for any grammatical mistakes... Unlike Ms. Steele, I am not an English major)",1
14,"I read a 1/4 of the book so I had an idea of what the movie entailed. To me, this was just a different version of Nine and 1/2 Weeks. I thought Anastasia was too unattractive for the part, but played a good innocent type with a dominating side to herself. Christian Grey was cast well. For the most part, the movie was weak and easy to make fun of. It did not turn me on at all. I think this is more for the young and inexperienced in life. I think it's sad when a person has to result in getting tortured to feel fulfilled. Overall, not impressed.",0
15,"All it has is sex no real story its a terrible movie that should not be supported IMO Don't let the popularity and advertisement of this film fool you, because this film is bad. It's not even bad - it's atrocious. With little 'erotic' behavior and a whole lot of caked over domestic violence, this movie is not only bad in the sense of story and bad acting, but teaches women to stay in abusive relationships.",0
16,As a girl I expected this to be a nice movie. It just isn't. It's boring and with no story at all. Avoid at all cost cause only thing I wanted to tie after this movie is a noose around my neck.,0
17,"Cheesy, cringe-worthy dialogue. Wooden, robotic performance by Jamie Dornan, who lacked the intensity and charisma needed to pull off the character. Dakota Johnson was ok, and had a charm to her but had no chemistry with the other lead. Awful, unsatisfying ending.",0
18,"Fifty Shades of Grey more like Fifty Shades of Abuse. The story is about a literature student, interviews the wealthy, intimidating Christian Grey and instantly develops an attraction to the enigmatic man. Grey is likewise drawn to Ana - but will only agree to a relationship on his own terms. Both will discover a place where want and desire intersect. Fifty Shades of Grey was a movie that I had zone interested in, because I was in that bad mood where if I see a best selling novel being made into a movie which is a cliche now, and now there did it with Fifty Shades of Grey which by the way the book sucked ass, yeah I red the book and I had no idea why it was a best seller it's basically porn on paper. What's more annoying is in the UK there are people on the Radio and everyone I met who was looking forward to this movie and my Question is why. The people on the Radio keep making top stories about it making it the hot headline and I'm here thinking ""That's really new worthy. There's loads of usual but amazing things happening around the world and this peace of **** makes the headline. My hope for humility is slowly fading away"". And that's not all, I'm not kidding you here but there actually made a headline of it's reviews it's getting and this never happened before when it comes to movies. So after seeing Fifty Shades of Grey I can say it's not as bad as people say, it's actually a lot worse then I thought. Now let me give you the positive things in this movie: Dakota Johnson was the only good actress in this movie, she did what she can do with a god awful script that she had and shes the only one in this movie that gives it her all. The movie is shot really good as well, it fitted the movie very well, but beside's that all those good things can't hind the fact that this is a abomination against humanity, it brings shame to cinema and it should be burn in hell. Now let's talk about Mr. Grey The Psychopath, now I got to ask you this what do women see in this guy, I mean his not charming at all, his cold, he's kind of a **** and what he want's to do is hurt you with sex, and the actor himself isn't really that good at all. And she doesn't enjoy it she only does it to make him feel good so in the sex scenes she's not enjoying it, she's getting hurt by this guy and after a while she get's crossed with him and then she runs off then start's to have thoughts about him and how she needs a man in her life so she goes back. The writing in this movie I don't know if it's for comic relief or to be taken seriously, because the writing in this movie was absolutely atrocious and it's the most cheesiest dialogue ever put to film, it's Twilight dialogue bad. Now is this worse than Twilight and I can't believe I'm saying this but yes it is. I found a movie that's more awful and more laughable than Twilight. I hated this movie, I hated it, I HATED IT, I HATED IT. This is the worst movie of 2015, I can't wait to forget this film. You better off seeing Kingsman: The Secret Service, I haven't see it myself yet but at least that movie looks well made and effort went into it.",0
19,"This is destined to be the worst movie of the year.Oh My God what is this movie,the acting is terrible the two main actors have no chemistry at all that makes you wonder who chose them.There are some okay-ish looking scenes here and there but that's it.Terrible one liners and to think that they are getting a freaking sequel to this boring ass movie.What is the point of it ? Why does it have to exist I will never understand.",0
20,"Kinky not really, Fifty Shades of Grey falls flat.  The problem is that the film is pretty boring and also has a poor script.  You can definitely see the Twilight fan fiction, though this film at least looks good.  D",0
21,Twilight fan-fiction.. need I say more?  Twilight fan-fiction.. need I say more?  Twilight fan-fiction.. need I say more?  Twilight fan-fiction.. need I say more?,0
22,OMG. What's with all the hype with this movie??? This movie sucks ass! This movie is probably for horny teenagers or single people? Definitely not for married people.  I'm beyond disappointed. My husband and I gave up watching it after 50 minutes into the movie. ﻿,0
23,"This is a movie about nothing. I left the cinema and I've asked myself, what it is all about? There is no plot, just a guy dating a girl like we see in every movie as a subplot. This movie has only the subplot. The trailer you see is the movie itself. For those who want some hot action, sorry but there is none, just some kissing scenes and romance, and they're so poor(not even closer to those 90's soft porn). I swear, there is no sex scene and the dude does not even use all the spanking stuff he has there. When he beats her with 6 whippings(camera on dude's face, then SLAP!, then girl's face), the movie is over.",0
24,"Worst movie I think I've ever seen.  Boring, slow, and uneventful.  Even the ""sex"" scenes were boring, and that was that bad.  There was no chemistry, and the movie ended before anything interesting could happen.  It might have been alright if they cut an hour from the movie of useless garbage, moved it along at a much faster pace, hired some actors that could make someone believe they have some sort of feeling, and put a proper ending to the movie.",0
25,some body say this is a love story!!!! I don't think so. love not like this!! this is sexual dreams of the author...with this movie we see fall of the Cinema... oh **** cinema is dying help...,0
26,"By far the worst movie I've ever seen.  Almost walked out (and I've never done that before).  I actually liked the book.  Their relationship had humor, intelligence and she had strength that ended up ""saving"" him.  The movie captured none of that.  The acting was flat and wooden, the casting was awful.  They should have hired Ian Somerhalder.  He has the drop dead gorgeous looks of a Christian Grey and he can act.  It was so awful they'd have to pay ME to see the other 2 when they come out.",0
27,"This is the first movie that I have seen in a VERY long time that I would not even see through to the ending. I'm a guy so I do believe that it is more difficult for myself to get wrapped up into Mr. Grey's appeal in the movie, however, to me he was just boring, and too out of reach and unrealistic. In my opinion, Mr. Grey would have been better suited had he been more down to earth and realistic. I believe that most of the female's attraction for him was wrapped up in wealth and materialistic things rather than sexual pleasure. All in all, I was very disappointed in the film, so much that my girlfriend and I attempted watching this film together and she turned it off before I could.",0
28,"This is exactly what you would expect from a film based on a book that was initially just a moronic Twilight fan fiction novel. The relationship makes no sense, the basis of the plot makes no sense and it glorifies physical and emotional abuse.",0
29,"""iF THE SAME STORY TOOK PLACE IN A MOBILE HOME IT WOULD BE AN EPISODE OF LAW AND ORDER SVU"" -Anonymous    This movie will make you lose all faith in humanity...",0
32,Consider my inner goddess unsatiated with this surprisingly boring and dull adaptation of E.L.James' already terrible book. No chemistry between leads and wooden BDSM action.,0
33,"No es novedad que un libro tan viral, con tantas ventas, al final del día realicen una pelicula sobre esta. Quiero decir que no leí el libro (ni lo leeré) pero en cuestión de adaptación y censura, supongo que tuvieron que cortar demasiadas escenas de sexo (algunas sumamente estúpidas) para que esta pelicula lograra por lo menos una clasificación ""R"" (o C en México) pero en fin, recuerdo que me senté frente a la computadora y me dije: ""veré esta pelicula sin la necesidad de buscarle contras o con la intención de criticarla"" pero esto no duro ni 10 minutos, la pelicula es un error total, en primer lugar, no me cabe en la cabeza la idea de que esta pelicula es romance y amor (el cual no lo es) pues yo solo veo una atmósfera tétrica, oscura, estúpida, repleta de Sadomasoquismo o masoquismo. ¿Desde cuando las mujeres ven a un hombre enfermo mental atractivo? no lo entiendo, ¿sera porque es millonario? ¿tiene autos de lujo? no tengo idea. Fifty Shades of Grey cuenta la historia de Anastasia, una estudiante virgen tímida que va a entrevistar a Christian Grey para un trabajo de su compañera de cuarto, la interacción de Jamie Dornan con Dakota Johnson es plana, no se sienten reales, Anastasia siempre tiene la misma cara: ""orgasmo"" ""tristeza"" ""orgasmo"" ""enojo"" ""orgasmo"".La relación de estos dos es tonta, aburrida y poco interesante, ambos personajes no aportan nada de carisma, se vuelven tediosos y odiosos, por poner un ejemplo:Christian Grey: ""te regale un auto, una computadora, libros y todo lo que tu desees ¿seras mi sumisa?Anastasia: No, no quiero volver a verte (pasan 2 minutos) Te amo.Por el amor de Dios, esta pelicula es basura! Con lo que respecta a las escenas de sexo, prometen mas de lo que son, así que no vayas con la idea de que veras escenas sexuales sumamente explicitas y polémicas.Sam Taylor-Johnson hace lo que puede en esta pelicula, no es culpa de ella que la pelicula no funcionara, de hecho se ve que puso todo su esfuerzo para que al menos fuera pasable, la culpa la tiene la historia (y por supuesto la escritora E.L James) una historia aburrida, nada interesante, mediocre y con poca originalidad (¿olvide mencionar que esto es ""Crepúsculo"" con sexo?) Lo unico perdonable de aquí es el Soundtrack (por parte de Danny Elfman) no es que sea una obra maestra, pero es lo unico decente que tiene esta pelicula (¿esto se le puede llamar pelicula? este termino no entra aquí...)",0
34,"BIG FAMOUS BEST SELLING BOOK... terrible money making movie. This movie was created only to make money since the book became famous because of its erotic clasification and a controversial BDSM related themes. I've read the books and after seen the movie, I was very disapointed, the MOST important thing about this book is every thought Anastasia had about Grey and BDSM, in this movie you cant get to know what is going on in her mind. You can interpret that she doesnt like the way he is or the way he treats her, but she still got into BDSM practices, and the important WHY she did it, its totally missing. To make this movie even worse, one of the things that people critizised about the book, is that BDSM is practiced by people with psychological problems, people that need help, people that are sick... and once again this movie fails into proyecting this same way of seen Grey as a sick person. Bad sex scenes, failure in thansmiting the main ideas of the bdsm and Anastasias thoughts, and TERRBLE performance of the principal character Christian Grey, in the movie he looks like an idiot, VERY different form the book. Dont waste your time watching this movie, I know many people dont like to read, but believe me, if you want to know what the fifty shades are all about, you better read the books.",0
35,"Here's another movie that acts like a joke on the book that it's based on. Instead of calling it Fifty Shades of Grey, let's call it Fifty Shades of Jokes on the Book.",0
36,"Just no...Seriously, it's a very boring film that went far longer than necessary and without a central, well-written plot to guide it. The actions that are taken by the characters are unrealistic and are forced without legitimate motivation other than the shallow romantic tension between the two main characters.",0
38,"Haven't wanted to walk out on a film since ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"". I couldn't do that at this film since I was on a date, thus compounding my suffering. No story, no character development, no resolution, and grade school dialog make this the loser film of the year. Before I even said a thing after the ending, my date apologized for dragging me out to this atrocity. This sums it up: Let's write a novel about every girl's fantasy unicorn of a man, include an S&M component to add an aspect of taboo in order to pique more interest, then start a viral marketing campaign to get people to talk about the novel. This'll cause everyone to read it to see what the big deal is. When they find out there's no big deal, they'll be asking everyone else, what the big deal was, spiraling the virality of the novel. And then of course, capitalize on the commercial success of this marketing ploy by making a film on the cheap and let the viral aspect do all the marketing of the film for you. Final step, use your Benji's from novel/film profits to light up your contraband Cubans whilst bathing in champagne.",0
39,"Fifty Shades of Grey should have been a guilty pleasure film. It wasn't. Instead Fifty Shades is filled with a tedious plot, completely forgettable side characters, leads that have no chemistry and lame BDSM scenes. I wasn't aroused. Nuff said.",0
40,"So, I don't know what kind of dimwitted mind thought this was a steamy film, or even a romantic film for grown-ups. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is and feels like the byproduct of a corporative contract. If the book it's based on is just laughably pedestrian and dull, the film equivalent nearly rivals it in monotony. There's no emotion, no passion, no life; like Christian Grey, it's all cold, calculated and mechanic. Want to watch a real steamy film about sex for grown-ups? Please go and watch Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' and avoid this infantile, seems-to-be-made-for-promiscuous-teenage-girls drivel at all costs. And, the 'strong sexual content' that the MPAA rating suggests is a joke.",0
41,"I once was wet, but now I am dry.Did anybody read that story about the woman who saw this is the theater and then shat herself? Manchester I think it was.",0
42,"Never read the book, wasn't expecting the film to be any use and I was glad not to be proven wrong this time. I was not the only person to spend most of the film laughing at the endlessly boring scenes of terrible dialogue given by one dimensional characters with not a shred of chemistry between them. No character development whatsoever with lame attempts at adding backstory that at that point I just didn't care about. As for the rest of the film, to say it was cringeworthy is an understatement, awkward and pathetic.To everyone involving in the making of this ""film"": if you set out to make a good movie you have failed miserably, but if you set out to make money gratulations and enjoy your time upon your giant throne of money to which I am sorry to say I contributed.",0
43,I knew i was going to hate the movie within the first five minutes. It's just silly the two main characters are hard to like and habe zero chemistry. The dialogue is painfully slow. There is supposed to be a build up to the intimate scenes but even those are really really boring and nonsensical. I won't even  go into how deeply offended and violated the movie made me feel as a woman. Disgusting. Worst movie I've watched so far.,0
44,"That movie is dangerous, nasty and scary for everybody, it's got extreme sex, torture porn, domestic violence and extreme rape. I heard that a guy asks a girl stranger to come and gets forced to have sex all the time, that's dangerous. WORST MOVIE EVER!",0

I'm still wondering how this mess made it passed the pitch. The sex scenes were rubbish, it wasn't hot at all, it made me cringe more than anything. It was very hard to stay focused for such a long time. The film is about 2 hours long but I felt like I had been in the cinema for a about week. This should of just stayed as a dirty book, it doesn't work as a motion picture because most of the sex couldn't be put in, and that's literally the entire story, sex! If you're planning on watching this, don't. Don't waste your money.",0

I mean: Putting aside the BDSM scenes, in many stages there was unavoidable to remember similarities (including ""bed scenes"") with the film starred by Julia Roberts and Richard Gere in the 90s. And this is precisely the main point: people went to see some erotic dark movie following the trailers and the expectation but, in return, they received a romantic tragicomedy film that, in my opinion, lacks of the conviction needed to connect the audience to the story. My note: 2 points, one of them by the staging and the other by the excellent performance of Dakota Johnson.",0
56,"Extremely tasteless, empty and vulgar, for a primitive viewer, exceptionally bad story or simply no story at all, bad screenplay, bad everything, even bad soft porno, I was driving home and thinking about “Pretty Woman”, or “Thomas Crown Affair…..",0
57,ho ever made this **** movie is a **** animal well kinda just tell me that you are joking with me right? now one thing this is a movie that people like to watch and its in the movies and its a porn movie dude get a life!,0
58,"I bet that if I were to ask the majority of the main demographic watching Fifty Shades of Grey this weekend what the acronym BDSM stands for, I would get a very unsatisfied and baffled answer. Low and behold, welcome to the world of popular culture and worldwide phenomenas for no damn good reason. If someone were to ask me, how and why this particular novel, written atrociously by British author E.L. James became such a huge success, I wouldn’t know where to begin. Upon all the controversy, arguments and opinions about the novel and its depiction of submissive sexual culture, I guess we, as a general population, have to accept the fact that sometimes, people and certain pieces of pop culture, just get lucky for being around at the right place, at the right time. It’s not like erotic literature or erotic novels didn’t exist before E.L. James’ novel, its that THIS particular novel caught on with readers and has become the worldwide best-seller for the simple fact that, it just did. Upon learning about my advance sneak passes to the film, I went in with the highest level of professionalism and optimism possible, but when a film knows its going to be a hit, regardless of its talent and execution on screen, you pretty well have sealed your fate in the world of film criticism. I’m not sure if the actors and screenwriter Kelly Marcel intended for the dialogue and execution of the film to be so wooden, laughable and campy, but I guess when you are adapting a film to a novel that has been deemed unworthy of professional publication, regardless of your level of screenwriting and acting skills, you can’t do much. From the moment the screen is filled with the shaded lighting of corporate florescent bulbs in the Grey building, one cannot help but notice how little effort is put into the film’s production. Set around one of the most conventional narrative foundations ever, Fifty Shades of Grey is your typical Romeo and Juliet love story of forbidden love. Upon learning of her friend Kate’s (Eloise Mumford) illness, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is forced by her best friend to cover for school newspaper’s article upcoming interview with the mysterious and intimidating business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Once Ana and Christian meet, the two begin a steamy and sensual relationship filled with singular sexual tastes, obsession, seduction and mental and emotional pain and pleasure. Yup, thats it. Before the film even started production, the casting process gain high media attention. Having Angelina Jolie reject directing the film, Chritian Cooke, Dominic Cooper and Stephen Amell circling the role of Christian Grey, and talented actresses Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Imogen Poots and Shailene Woodley reportedly being considered and auditioning for the role of Ana Steele, the cast was settled with Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam. Hunnam, who withdrew from the film due to a backlash of media frenzied fans who said the role simply wasn’t meant for the actor, officially abandoned the project and was replaced by Dornan. Notice how more is being written about the casting history of the film more than the plot itself? The lead actors of the film, must have approached the role as a double edged sword of fame and credibility. For one, Johnson and Dornan are destined of becoming household names, especially with the promise of huge economic gain, given the novels already huge fan base and demands of sequels. Yet, Fifty Shades of Grey brings to question one very important question: are artists and actors, willing to sacrifice their artistic integrity for fame and fortune? I mean, how else could one describe the leads being able to learn and mesmerize their lines in only five days? Fifty Shades of Grey did not upset me as much as I thought it would. What upsets me most about this highly questionable and overwhelmingly popular phenomena is its misuse in everyday people’s lives and the misleading conception of romance and its force for capitalist gain. Whereas, this time of year, romantic films are cleverly slotted before the Valentine’s Day week, this is one film that abandons romance and the pure notion of ‘love’ for sole monetary gain. Do people really care to be the submissive? Is there going to be a surge in toys and fetish tools thanks to the film? Quite possibly. How else do you explain an officially marketed branding of fifty shades sex toys and fetish equipment at your local sex store?",0
59,"Hated this film from start to finish. Usually a film has at least some enjoyable quality in it that makes me give it some sort of pass or understand why critics give it a 46 indicating mixed or average reviews but needless to say, there was nothing enjoyable about 50 Shades of Gray. The story is a boring, sexed up rip-off of Twilight that offers nothing but you leaving it wishing you could have your 125 minutes you wasted on this glorified porn back.",0
60,"I've read the book. The first one. I wasn't impressed. I didn't appreciate the writing, so I wasn't expecting much from the screen version either. I'm glad, however, that I read the book before. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have a clue about what's going on besides sex and obsession. There were way too many plot holes for me, like what is Grey's Enterprises? Do they sell stocks? Do they secretly push drugs and cover themselves as an impressive building that's an entire city block? What? I still don't know, as a viewer and not a reader. From the standpoint of a film student, having techniques and all ingrained into my mind, I do give this movie a star on cinematography, because I did appreciate it. Some of the set lighting was curiously put, but it worked. I didn't like the acting. It was awkward. Not a spark of chemistry for me between Dorman and Johnson. There wasn't enough background for me either. This was really just a mess, and the sex made its money back. I didn't have much for this movie at all. Oh, but the soundtrack was really good, and excellently used.",0

64,"“Fifty Shades of Grey Review” So for the second time, I just finished watching this movie and...wow, just wow. When it comes to a film like this, the question and really the only relevant question that I have is “what the fecal matter is this?” This movie is horrible and I'll cast some light as to the reasons why it's horrible but first let me note a few things. I'm not going to even bother structuring this review. This means making separate sections for “Presentation”, “Characters”, “Music”, etc. This movie doesn't deserve that level of time or effort. I'm not going to insult the word “spoiler” because this movie doesn't have a plot. I'm not going sit here and write paragraph after paragraph after paragraph explaining in every little small exquisite detail why this movie is bad which I could very well do but considering two hours of my time has already been wasted, I'm not going to stress out my level of patience further. Now onto my tailored and straightforward to the point review of this crap known as Fifty Shades of Grey. First of all, I'm going to be blunt, this movie does not have a plot. I repeat, there is no story in this movie which is understandable because this bull**** is based off a trilogy of books inspired by ******* Twilight. That within of itself says enough and it says enough in spades. The premise for this garbage, and I can't believe I just insulted the word “garbage” is about a young college grad named Anastasia Steele or Anna. Anna goes to interview this young billionaire, that's right “Billionaire”, pretty boy, named Christian Grey. Christian just after one interview almost immediately becomes a stalker and with enough persistence, he and Anna elope in this one sided relationship which involves her becoming his sex slave. After about an hour and fifty minutes of nothing, Anna finally decides to grow a brain and she considers the relationship to be abusive despite the fact that it was an abusive relationship from the start and this was explained to her by Christian himself exactly what this was going to be early on in the movie. So, Anna decides to leave Christian and the movie ends. Cut to black, begin end credits. …Yeah, that's the movie. And as a word of some positivity, Dakota Johnson wasn't too bad in this. She did inject some humor into her lifeless character but she nor anyone else is saving this film right here. So what's the problem with the movie? Many things, the first being the way this was marketed. Fifty Shades of Grey was marketed to be this soft-core pornographic film being toted as a serious movie. In that regard alone, this is somewhat okay considering other films such as Secretary have done the same and have done this a lot better but that's for another discussion. The problem with Fifty Shades in this regard is the fact that the “porn” in this movie is bare-bones the minimum of what they could have done. Yes there's nudity in the film but aside from a flat chested Dakota Johnson flash every now and then and someone's a** cheeks popping up on screen, this is some of the most boring “porn” that you could watch. The movie tends to cut these scenes long before they have the chance to become interesting and they're not even shot very well. To make matters worse, the pornographic material is the only thing that the movie has going for it. The characters in this movie, they're all bad, all of them. I don't care if you're talking about the potentially wasted guy friend of Anastasia, her roommate, her father, her mother, Christian's mother, his brother, it doesn't matter. They're all bad. The only two characters given any appropriate screen time are Christian and Anastasia themselves and neither one of them are good characters. In fact, they're both poorly written and very, very rage inductively stupid. Anastasia is one of the worst written female characters that I've seen in a film in quite some time. Women always want to talk about how Hollywood doesn't take women seriously and throws them in cliché roles yet, the majority of you hypocrites want to go out and pay to see a dumb bland character like this as a protagonist. To those women out there who paid for this, you're only insulting yourself at this point. Anastasia is stupid, she's dumb, she's bland, she's hardheaded, she's uninteresting, she's not even all that attractive! Dakota Johnson is pretty but she's not a supermodel looking chick and for a rich character like Christian Grey, you would think he would be acting like a stalker/serial killer for someone whom at least looks like a supermodel but no! He goes for the bare-minimum of what he can supposedly get, despite his high profile status which is overemphasized to the point of illogical irrelevance and sheer utter stupidity in this stupid movie. Christian himself to say a few words, is literally as I explained. He personifies the traits of a stalker/serial killer and he can get away with it because he's handsome and he's a billionaire which by the way, and I know this question has been asked with this retarded series but, did a sixteen year old girl write this? An example of this behavior by this Christian character would be a scene near the beginning of the movie just after Anna and Christian meets one another. Anna is in the middle of working at her job and from right around the corner isle, this creepy a**hole just pops up out of nowhere like a damn stalker with the first words out of his mouth being “I thought it was you”. Yeah I'm sure you did think it was her. You were probably watching her from the moment she walked out of her home to the moment you decided it was a good idea to wait in a specific isle like the shadow of god damn Michael Myers. That's just a tip of the iceberg of what's wrong with this character. Another scene, the club scene, which is also near the beginning of the movie, Anna gets drunk and Christian calls her scolding her as if he was her father despite the fact that they literally met barely even ten minutes ago in the film. (Phone Ringing) (Christian Grey Calling) Anastasia: “I'm sorry I didn't mean,” Christian: “Stay where you are I'm coming to get you” Anastasia: “What?” (Click) ME: “The ****??” All this bs and it's not even thirty minutes into the movie! The entire useless two hours of this abysmal calamity has this Anastasia character questioning “well why don't we go on a date?” “why can't I touch you?” “why can't we be like normal people?” He explained to you from the beginning what this relationship was going to be!!!! What the ****?!! It takes this girl two hours to grow a brain and say “I've had enough”. You should've been done with him when he showed you his sex dungeon! Any self respecting woman would've dropped this guy at several scenes in this movie but oh no not Anastasia! Because without bs, these lazy Hollywood executives would have no means of selling tickets because the movie would only last five minutes tops. Then the movie takes its bs even further with the Christian Grey character. So when Anastasia isn't getting on your nerves, it's this stupid idiot who sprouts some of the worst dialogue that I've heard in a while. The entire movie, this guy is moping, literally moping and he regurgitates the same thing over and over again. “I don't do romance”, “I don't do dating”, “I don't do intimacy” Bull****!! All he ever does is romance!! And this movie further misses an opportunity by trying to give this character a back story. Apparently the whole BDSM nonsense comes from him being a submissive to his mother's friend when he was a teenager. The sad part is that the movie could have been about that! The movie could have set up the plot where it was about this guy who was abusing this woman and all the women before her because he was trying to get back at this crazy woman who abused him the same way. But no! Instead what we get is a two hour live action equivalent of the Looney Tunes show, with unrealistic characters bantering the same nonsense back and forth. “Why can't we be normal?” “I don't do romance” “Why can't we be normal?” “I don't do romance” “Why can't we be normal?” “I don't do romance”. Over and over and over and over again like the movie is trying to bash your skull in with poor writing and even worse developed and uninteresting lead characters. And before I close out of this review, I want to mention the contract. Yes, these two idiots in this movie made a contract which discloses exactly what Christian is allowed/not allowed to do to Anastasia when they're engaged in sexual activity but this scene is completely pointless as later in the movie, Christian says it himself. “**** the contract”. Those are his exact words. So why did we insert this scene in this movie again? Oh that's right, it's in the movie to cover up the fact that for two hours, nothing of importance happens in this movie. Fifty Shades of Grey besides Insurgent, another piece of diarrhea vomit that I will also review, is the most recent laziest and cheapest attempt at making money for Hollywood. The movie reeks of tropes that are specifically designed and placed into the film just to attract a dumb audience full of drones that will no doubt buy the Blu-ray on day one which is why this crap is at the number one spot on Amazon.com in the genre of romance which again is funny considering the fact that there is no legit romance in this movie, just BS! Because how can a movie based off a book series that's inspired from something as dull and stupid as the Twilight series possibly be about anything? And that's another thing, even Twilight is better than this! How do you accomplish something like that?!! At least in Twilight you had a decapitation here and there before it returned back to the same some ole repetitive BS. In this nonsense however, there's nothing of interest to look forward to, nothing, not one god damn thing. If this is really what women and I know its not all of you out there but me speaking to the majority. If this is really what women describe as entertainment then it's nothing but dark days ahead for mainstream audiences who like to go to the movies such as myself, even for general audiences. This is why Indies will always be better than what's mainstream in the film industry. There are too many idiots who don't care about the art form of film or even care about movies in general paying to go to the theater and have a “good time”. These people don't care about pacing or plot or character development. It's the equivalent of everyone who goes to see these fun but regurgitated superhero movies and loud nonsensical IQ insulting CGI fests like the Michael Bay Transformer films. The only difference is that movies like Fifty Shades of Grey, Twilight, and The Host are targeted towards a female audience who think they want to see romance but don't have a clear grasp on what that word actually means. It's a sad day, dark times are ahead for people who actually care about quality entertainment. If anyone has given this more than a one star up on here, you should be ashamed. By the way, can't wait for the even worse sequels to this nonsense, tsk. What's the next one called I wonder. ...Oh Fifty Shades Darker, how original. Yeah if you value common sense and especially if you value decent story telling then do yourself a favor and skip this.",0
65,"Jamie dornan thinks he is in a catwalk . His woodenness beyond words and absolutely no chemistry with Dakota Johnson .The story smells of staleness . We have seen the same film many times for example 9,5 weeks, secretary as far as the nudity goes nine songs and lie with me were much better. Adaptation of this popular book sadly delivers a big nothing. There isn't even a good love scene for Gods sake",0
66,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no real plot or character development it is over two hours of a girl trying to change a guy and him being totally wrong for her. This is what happens when you make a movie out of a fan fiction novel. The only reason anyone is even talking about this movie is the shock value but it isn't even interesting on that level. This movie is just banking on people going because is a taboo and don't even attempt to make it a good story. It will be embarrassing in 20 years when kids ask why this movie was such a big deal and even those who liked the movie now will have no explanation.,0
67,"First things first: I have not read the book, assuming that I'm not the targeted audience, and since I have read marquise de Sade and other classics I've assumed it's not going to be even slightly inspiring. But having read that the film was supposed to be better, that a score of script doctors worked on improving the characters and the plot, and stupidly getting into the frenzy of how inappropriate it was supposed to be - I went to see it. Even with the lowest of expectations that you can possibly have I hardly managed to sit through all of it. It bored me to death. The main plot is a totally unrealistic, flat and uninspiring, it's worse than piece of fan fiction written by a seventeen year old. Since I don't know the original book, I must assume it's even worse, which makes me shiver with dread. I have no idea why this film is rated 18+ in the UK, and described as including strong sex scenes - it has rather innocent sex scenes - all three of them. I've seen much more hardcore stuff in lower rated films, this is just ridiculous to call this film erotic - it isn't. And don't get fooled - the only BDSM - related scenes are the toys inside the red room. That remain mostly unused.But lack of sex is not the worst thing about it (although I suppose the viewers should complain about being mislead by the ad campaign around the film to believe they were going to see an erotic drama). the worst part is that I've never seen so poorly constructed characters before. They lack any dimensions, they are just two dummies, moved around by a kindergarten kid, reciting those daft, lifeless dialogues.I have never regretted paying money to see any film - but I do now. Luckily it's unlikely anyone but the hard core fans will be going to see the next two installments of this atrocity.The only mildly funny moment is the allusion to Jamie Dornan's role in The Fall. But it's not worth the money paid for the 2 hours of torture (and it's not the kind leading to satisfaction).Films like this one should be forbidden. It's awful to think some people watch it religiously, but then religion is the opium for the masses. And the masses lack the taste.",0

70,"Having read average reviews of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' prior to seeing it - and being male - my expectations of this movie-adaptation of a book distinctly targeted at women were low. And, normally, this would give such a movie the chance to surprise me and be a bit better than expected. Unfortunately not, in the case of this particular film.There are so many issues with it, that it's difficult to know where to begin. I guess the best place to start is with the leading actor and actress: Jamie Dornan (playing Christian Grey) and Dakota Johnson (Anastasia Steele). To say that there is little chemistry between these two would be an understatement. The problem being that this then permeates the rest of the movie; how can you believe any of the actions of the characters when you can't even believe that there is any love between them? Other than being rich, Christian's character has little going for him. His complete lack of humour or charisma, particularly in the first scene in which Anastasia meets him, leaves you wondering why Ana is so taken with him.Quick question for any women reading this review: if a potential boyfriend did any of the following things, what would your reaction be: a) Stalked you; b) Broke into your home and confronted you; c) Asked you to sign a contract saying that you'd do whatever he wanted (sexually) to please him; d) Told you that you're not sleeping in the same bed as him because that's ""not his thing"". That's right: you'd run a mile (possibly whilst phoning the police). Which really then begs questions as to why, on the basis of the books, Christian Grey seems to have become such a sex symbol. Is this really the kind of man that women fantasise about?Things don't get any better outside of the main two characters, either. Not to say that the other actors/actresses are all terrible but the parts they play are just so pointless that you wonder why they even needed to be in the movie. Max Martini (playing Christian's driver, Taylor) is completely wasted in a role that could have provided a bit more warmth and/or humour to the movie. On the other side of things, the scenes with Anastasia and her friend Kate (Eloise Mumford) are so painfully wooden that it feels like they're two really poor actresses reading directly from the script, auditioning for a part in the movie. We meet Christian's family and Anastasia's parents briefly, but they have little time (or dialogue) in which to contribute anything to the film.Finally, on the negative aspects, I'll bring up the main reason that 'Fifty Shades of Grey' has garnered so much interest: the sex scenes. I don't think it's unfair to say that they are about as far from erotic as they could possibly be. I've seen far sexier scenes in movies that didn't even require nudity to be sexy. Each sex scene in the movie seems to follow the same (or a very similar) pattern: 1) He takes her clothes off; 2) He ties her up (and possibly puts a blindfold over her eyes); 3) He takes his own clothes off; 4) He kisses her body (working further and further down); 5) She opens her mouth, moans and groans, and arches her back whilst the director uses the only two shots that she seems to have in her arsenal: the shot from above, and the side-shot, both avoiding revealing any genitalia. To be honest you can't help but feel that, by the time Christian has finished tying knots in all the ropes, Anastasia would have fallen asleep rather than be feeling aroused.The one bright point of the movie is some of the humorous dialogue provided by Anastasia (particularly her drunk phone call to Christian and a 'business meeting' with him). These are few and far between though and also felt slightly out of place in a movie which covers fairly dark material at times.What I will say is that if this movie had actually been produced with absolutely no intention of a sequel being made, then it could have been much improved. We could have seen Christian's love for Anastasia turn him from being a cold, distant character into a loving, caring person (think 'Despicable Me' but for adults). Unfortunately, we get a ludicrous open-ended finale which leaves you feeling like the movie went absolutely nowhere in the space of two hours. Ironically, I think this approach is bad for the franchise overall: instead of delivering one reasonably good movie, you're going to get possibly 3 terrible ones. That's up for argument though: whilst I'm sure this movie will do well at the box office, I truly believe that - once people realise how badly it fails to deliver on its erotic premise - there may not be quite the same appetite for a sequel. Only time will tell.",0
71,"An absolute bore. The only parts that captured my attention were the helicopter and sailplane bits.Everything else was ridiculous. Maybe they should develop the story a bit more in the next one.I don't know what all the fuss was about.In summary, don't waste your time on this one. See it on megashare or some other website. It's not worth the money the film is printed on.On the other hand,  Danny Elfman did the score - so that's going for it, which is nice.",0
72,"This film is an embarrassment to women, not at all what I thought it was supposed to portray from the media hype.

77,"It humorous what passes for movies these days. Granted the book didn't leave much of anything positive to work with. The book was a fair attempt at best to write an erotic novel.

78,"The most crazy film in the history of cinema, such as still and movie missed, it's just nonsense !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
79,"I did not read the books so I was not sure exactly what I was in for. I had heard mixed reviews of the books from people saying they were sexually liberating to it being a story of abuse. I am going with the latter if the movie is anything to go by. Christian Grey is a stalker and while I have loved Dornan in other work in this movie I found him flat, unappealing and impossible to connect with. Perhaps that is how Grey is supposed to be? I have not seen Johnson's other work but while she is an attractive young woman I found Ana a complete bore. I had really high hopes for this character hoping that she would be a strong woman who enters BDSM to further strengthen herself. Instead she is weak and I am surprised she resisted signing the contract and I am surprised she left at the end because in every other part of the movie she seems to give in to Grey's whims even when she has said she does not want to. I found it creepy that Grey did not take no for an answer and seduced her whenever she tried to resist him. I was also disgusted in how they portrayed BDSM as some kind of mental disorder of Christians (Although I believe this is directly from the book) Fifty Shades of Grey demonstrated how you can get two very attractive actors to perform a sex scene and yet have it not the vaguest bit arousing or hot. I am a huge lover of BDSM and yet found myself not even slightly amused, entertained or even aroused by the whipping or bondage. Is this not meant to be an erotic love story?  Furthermore the lack of chemistry between Johnson and Dornan was so clear that I could not believe their relationship for a second. The dialogue was laughable and cheesy. I can't even begin to express how hard it was for me to listen to the badly delivered drivel. The movie lacked a climax (Unless the scene where he beats Ana is supposed to be that) and the best part was the ending. I wish it did end there because then I could live in the fantasy that Ana goes back to a life free from abuse and Christian gets therapy. But there are two more of these to come! There were only two things I liked about this movie:The soundtrackAnd the scene where they discuss the terms of the contract - for in that moment there was actually a glimmer that Ana could be a strong powerful woman. However these two things could not even earn the movie one point in my opinion. I really felt as if I wasted two hours of my life and I have never seen a movie that made me feel that way before.",0
80,well that was a waste of a cinema ticket. so bad it dosn't deserve a thought of review. The only reason I am even bothering to review this i to warn others away from this drivel,0
81,I could sh*t a better story. Enough said. now excuse me while i try to reach my one hundred and fifty character minimum because thats all i had to say,0
83,Ana's fear was palpable.  There is nothing romantic about watching her be scared and controlled.  This is toned down from the book.  It was awful and very triggering.,0
84,"Take a chaste virgin. Done? Okey. Take a millionaire. Done? Okey. Now take a chaste virgin and do something with her. What? Something terrible. **** which has  more experiences than a porn scene. BDSM and others. And that´s all. It is red library for 40 years old mothers, which have childrens and wait for miracle with millionaire.....The only reason I saw it was promised sex.",0
85,"I have not seen the Film. I am not mature enough yet. But my brother has read the first Chapter of the book. ""Poorly Written"" his verdict. So, if you want to read the book, Don't bother. Trust me.",0
86,"the worst movie I've ever seen. it teaches men that if they have money and handsome, they can love, torture and abuse any woman that is beautiful, the movie also teaches women to be in an abusive relationship. why they represent the women as a weak person and the man as a strong person. and I can't imagine the fact that this movie was released in valentine's day, like which two people that love each other will watch this bad movie.",0
89,"the film is good if not compared to the book, I really enjoyed it. The actors are good, Dakota represented very well Anastasia and Jamie Dornan was not the Christian that I thought for the part, but he surprised me, I hope the Fifty shades darker is better than the first.",1
90,"I actually really enjoyed this film, doesnt quite live up to the book and what that leads you to imagine, but has its own twist on the writers words without leaning towards a porno, which lets face it a lot of people were expecting.",1
92,"Amazing, just amazing.This movie was heartbreathing.Intense.For people who was except porn it's normal that you don't like it because IT'S NOT PORN UNDERSTAND THAT.You should go to see it even if you didn't read the book, it show us a different vision of relationship.",1
93,I loved the movie. It is so true to the book and the cast is perfect just like movie. It is so well done and i can't wait to watch it again and again.,1
95,"People who hate this movie are really overreacting.  It's very pretty as far as visuals go.  The only part i can really criticize is that Ana seemed really manipulative. Dude was a creeper twice, sure, showed up when he shouldn't know where she was. But other than that, he was really blunt and explicit about what he wanted and needed from her. She on the other hand, says, ""Give it to me,"" and acts like a little bi*ch when he does, in fact give it to her.  Didn't read the books and i don't care about your feminist dissertation on how this is ""abuse,"" or why I'm supposed to dislike it.  Jamie Dornan is a good actor in a tough role, fighting his natural accent. Melanie Griffuths daughter...well she was okay i guess.  People are overreacting to this soooooo much.  See the movie and make up your own mind.",1
96,loved this film i don't understand how people can say its domestic violence and rape! has no one seen or heard of bdsm? or do u just not understand it?,1
97,"let me start by saying i loved this film ! i went in with a real open mind i did expect the sex to be vary corny and just stupid like a porno but hands down you did a brilliant job of them when you watch the sex scenes you sorta think why isnt my sex life that good ! i loved the movie !i cant wait for the next one !!!!second of all to all the people out there that are saying it abuse just sit down and shut up coz i can tell you from experiences or abuse its not ! and its really offensive that you are saying that ! this film is brilliant !",1
98,"I enjoyed the movie and i thought it was great. It's not a sex movie like everyone says it is as there is a love story to it. The sex scenes are not pornographic. If people enjoyed  The Wolf of Wall Street, which shows a great deal of sex scenes; then they should enjoy Fifty Shades. I did not expect the movie to be like the book and glad it wasn't, because then it would ruin the excitement of reading  the book and using your own imagination. Sam Taylor-Johnson and the actors did a great job and I'm looking forward to watching parts 2 and 3.",1
100,"Arriving as a target to face a probable onslaught of negative reviews from cynical and jaded critics, I decided to view this media juggernaut before passing judgement myself. Not having read the book, and having absolutely no desire to do so, I was still curious as to what the story was aside from containing the odd kinky sex scene. The good news is that whilst it may be a bit of fluff, it’s slick and oddly intriguing fluff that contains two impressive performances, top notch production values and beautiful music that perfectly underscores the drama.The aforementioned sexual content has had critics using the words ‘bland’ and ‘vanilla’ whereas, in fact, for a mainstream commercial film these scenes are actually quite strong. They have been very well integrated into the story and first rate choreography and editing have maximised their effect. Let’s face it this is fluff, not porn, and so this was never going to be ‘Deep Throat’ or ‘Debbie Does Dallas’ and I for one am extremely thankful for it. Also, strangely for a film that is aimed primarily at women, as I’m sure the book was, it has the potential to also alienate many of that gender. I’m sure not all women will be appreciative of Christian Grey’s very singular sexual proclivities.Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have great chemistry together and Johnson in particular is an actress to watch. Dornan certainly looks the part, but his performance is is better in the TV series ‘The Fall’. It’s also good to see Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden in support, albeit in thankless mother roles. Still, this is undoubtedly Johnson and Dornan’s dance and the two leads make the material work.The film also benefits by not taking itself too seriously. Dornan, in particular, seems to be playing Grey with his tongue very firmly in his cheek. One scene in which the two characters partake of a formal Business meeting is very amusingly played out. On the other hand an early bar scene showing a drunk Johnson being rescued by Grey represents the film at its worst.If the film ultimately outstays its welcome it nevertheless has exceeded expectations. It may not be highbrow entertainment, but it’s certainly not torture.",1
101,It's not a masterpiece but the Movie is very good. I enjoy it and I love it. I want more!! I recommend watch the Movie. It's a love history style Danielle Steel. The performances are good but Dakota Johnson is amazing and shine.,1
102,"I just finished watching Fifty Shades of Grey and I thought the director and actors did a good job with the film. For all the nay sayers out there, you can have your opinion, but this story is not about domestic abuse. It is far from it. 1. They both consent to the activities in the contract. 2. She wants to know the punishment to the fullest. 3. If she wanted to stop she could have used the safe words at anytime and she chose not too. The other to books explain a lot of this. I have read romantic novels and other erotica novels . Fifty shades is actually quite tame compared to others such as the series Tiffany Reiz that include Siren, The mistress, The prince, and etc. In these novels they do get marked and it is more explicit and it explains more of the BDSM world such as what collars represent and how most submissives turn to being dominants, etc.  If they explained the contract more in the movie with FSOG, you would have known that one of the hard conditions was not to mark or harm the skin in any way, no hot waxes, cutting or any of that. It dives deep into Grey and explains why he does what he does and why in general people go into the BDSM world. I don't feel abusive relationships are the same. For I have been in one and I would know. Individuals are controlling in both the difference is with BDSM you have a choice and can choose to stop, but  with the other it happens whether you want it to or not and it doesn't stop.",1
104,"I did not like Ana in the book, but I loved Dakota Johnson's interpretation of Ana. Ana was an idiot in the book. I didn't like reading her dumb thoughts. In the movie, the same actions make more sense because I'm seeing what she's feeling with her expressions. After all, What's s girl to do when her first boyfriend is more than kinky?",1
105,Great film! The whole cinema loved it and was shouting out for more at the end. This film is really for the fans of the books and it didn't disappoint. They have to make a sequel!,1
106,"At first I was skeptical, with the choice of the male main character. Went to see a movie and Jamie Dornan was as great as Christian Grey as he could. He did amazing job, I give him 10 points. Both Dakota and Jamie had charisma work well between them, and played the scenes great, considering. I like the movie and I 'm looking forward to see the sequel.",1
107,"An awkward college grad (Dakota Johnson) is slowly seduced by a sexy young billionaire (Jamie Dornan). This is really just a cat-and-mouse romance with a BDSM twist. It's success depends on the performances of the 2 leads and the director's skill at maintaining tension in what's basically a dialogue. Surprisingly, Dornan is prettier than Johnson, but they both create characters that are complex and compelling. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson has filled the film with sexually-charged stress and attractively erotic sex scenes. It's every woman's dream of a dazzling, devoted lover (granted, with some emotional complications) and it's played out with alluring skill.",1
110,"This movie was superb! I don't understand where everyone's angst is coming from except perhaps this movie wasn't their cup of tea. Then don't watch! I found it profoundly deep, funny and eccentric. It tested the limits and brought the audience to a much riskier place than any other movie. This is a first in it's class. No one knows about BDSM and this is bringing it some light. You don't have to be into it...but don't condemn it either. I love it. Can't wait to own it. and I might go watch it over and over. It was close to the book as it could be and yes it felt a bit rushed in the beginning but that's with any storyline brought from a novel to the big screen. Go watch it and keep your mind open ;)",1
111,esta historia lastimosamente  he recibido demasiada mierda encima en estos últimos meses yo me he leído los libros y puedo decir que estuvo bien representada y me dio buenas sensaciones ver como va ese romance a la pantalla grade bien toca mencionar que es algo meramente ficticio pero eso no le quita lo interesante,1
112,"OMG, i just can't with all these overreaction about this movie! I'VE WATCHED, and i love it! It's for entertainment, not made for Oscar, Golden Globes or something like this... Fun fun fun!",1
113,"There are many up in arms right now about this film. Frankly, there is room for all kinds of art. The people who hate this book, topic, ect., will never like this movie. Who will? ANYONE who loved the book, characters, plot, topics ect....ALSO, people looking for a good time & a non-gratuitous sexy movie. That's what this is. Yes, it can have some cheesy moments and I love the casting, but the lead's chemistry isn't quite right....but still....there are moments of levity, arousal, and cringing with a really good popcorn flick. MEN I urge you if your lady wants to see this....GO! You will make her happy, aroused, AND Dakota Johnson (very bravely and tastefully) is naked....a lot....I think this movie plays it a little too safe & 2 (later important) characters are left out, but overall the changes were just right. This movie can be as good as you want it to be and worth every dollar.",1
114,"50 Shades of Grey despite the very critical I think that before any review should avoid comparing it to the book. Never a movie exceeded the imagination. Technically it is very well done, photography is great, the performances are excellent and very summary captures the essence of the main drafts of the novel .They wanted to see more pornography? No need to be so explicit, strong scenes were very well worked and nudes are more emotional and real .They lead us to fully identify with the characters. It was a very good movie and look forward to continue the saga",1
115,"Absolutely amazing!  Dakota and Jamie are perfect as Ana and Christian.  They stayed pretty true to the book.  Yes, they left quite a bit out, but that's expected with a film adaptation.  I can't wait for Fifty Shades Darker. The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because I felt they relied to heavily on the soundtrack to provide their emotions and thoughts where they could have added important scenes from the book.  They missed a golden opportunity to show a more playful, happy Christian by not leaving out him returning to spend the night with Ana and being late for work the next morning.  A first for the billionaire CEO.",1
116,"Oh. My. God. This movie is a really beautiful love story, hot and steamy and true to the book. And the chemistry between Dakota and Jamie... wow! Can't wait to watch it again!",1
117,"The actors are really good and played their roles very well.This movie was good, I really love the musics and the way they do a remix of the book.But I still think that the book are much better than the movie but I think the next one will be better.",1
118,"Not a *great* film, but not a particularly bad one either. I'd rate it as average Hollywood romantic fluff with nude scenes and totally *consensual* (simulated) sex. Do not believe those who claim that *anything* in 'Grey' is forced or non-consensual; they've either not seen the film or have an agenda.All that aside, 'Grey' is not any more a waste of money than 'Hitch' or 'Maid in Manhattan' or any of the others.Moral of the movie: girls, when the guy tells you in clear and plain language exactly who he is, don't delude yourself into believing you can change him into Prince Charming. Believe him and either accept the frog, warts and all, or bail out and go look elsewhere.",1
119,"I think people who have not read the book will not be able to understand all the thing ( like when she roll her eyes etc..) the film was good, but I prefer the book. They skip a lot of important scene of the stories but I perfectly understand that it difficult to do all the thing in only 152minutes. So at this end, it was a good film but I could have been better.(From a French person)",1
120,"Some time ago a friend of my former partner involved herself in writing romance novels for a mass market publishing firm. She never showed any aptitude in writing before, but it was something to do next to running the family, which pinned her to her house for the better part of the day. The writing didn't ask much imagination as the stories were pretty formulaic. Like painting by numbers she just stayed within predefined boundaries and soon enough she cranked out another cheap novelette under the name of a non-existent writer such as D. J. Barding. The ingredients were always the same. The main protagonist was a woman aged twenty something to forty, single, and without any kids to tie her down. The man was in the same age range, but always a few years older, single as well, without romantic involvements. A setup to pursue their dalliance. Also the man was usually of a higher social standing and income group. She being a nurse, him being a doctor. She being a maiden, him being a lord. She being a student, him being a billionaire. And finally there was always something to surmount: a troubled past or a social barrier. The end saw the two joined in happy union. Usually. Sounds familiar?It is almost verbatim the story outline of fifty shades of grey. At this point you would expect me to start a long list of this movie's shortcomings, but I have to disappoint you for I am on the same page with the nostalgia critic in that this movie does the best with what it has got . In fact I will do one better. I find it a hilarious movie and it might be aiming for cult status by making a mockery of itself and of you. There are preposterous moments such as at the beginning when the female protagonist, Anna, tells to a friend that Grey is so clean. Wait. What did she just say? I checked and, heck, she says it: clean.. Grey is clean. This is her appraisal of a guy she just met. And somewhat further into the movie he pops up in the hardware store she is working in and starts buying things as tie ribs, ropes and chains. And I doubled over laughing. Was this a promise of things to come? Would she, later on, be subjected to what he is buying together with her there and then? And when he shows her his 'play room', a chamber done in black and red with racks filled with whips, floggers and canes - with only the bloody saw missing -, the only valid response would be to judge him **** crazy and flee, but instead she gapes as if he just revealed his private art collection, while at the same time listening to him telling her how he will use that stuff on her cause it is the only thing that turns him on. It is perfectly clear: they are seriously odd in the head. More hilarious moments follow when they come to the contract he so persistently insists upon. So we get a lengthy exposition of all the particulars of the fetish contract and she even calls for a meeting to go point for point through the contract discussing such things as the use vaginal clamps and anal fisting. All things he wants to do to her. Everything is off kilter in this movie that follows the prescription of a cheap romance flick but fills it with concepts that hail from the fetish world. He keeps on telling her how does not do the romantic thing, but for a large part of the movie he just does that, taking her with him in his helicopter, driving her around in his Lamborghini, taking her out for dinner and wooing her. He says A, but does B. And she believes B and ignores A. No wait she eventually begs him to do A. And when it happens she is really upset. This movie is a trashy romantic tale you wouldn't have wanted to see if it it hadn't held the promise of kinkiness. The sin of this movie therefore lies not with the movie, but with its detractors. What did you expect? Romeo and Jullia go kinky? Pride and Prejudice in skin tight leathers? Superheroes in latex instead of spandex? You knew it is crap. You know crap stays crap no matter what. Only in nature crap can produce roses. But ultimately what you wanted was PG rated kinky porn. That is by definition impossible. PG is not adult. If you want to see kinky porn go watch kinky porn. Histoire d'O springs to mind. This movie gets a ten because it makes a mockery of the source material and it exposes people for what they are: hypocrites. I am looking at you who goes to watch this on Valentine's day and gets disappointed! What where you thinking? But most of all because it gives a big middle finger to those who wanted so see their desire to have a continuous sexual stimulus, cloaked as having a 'special' relationship, a joining of spirits, vindicated and branded as a lifestyle.  BDSM isn't. You do it cause it turns you on. Just like using butt-plugs all the time : it is a fetish. And it remains abuse if you need to hurt someone else for pleasure even if it is with consent and even if you label it differently. And that is what this movie shows you bondage fetishists and that is why you hate it.",1
121,I liked the movie.I have read the book so many times that i went into the movie expecting some thing completely different.  I think that Dakota Johnson did a fantastic job as Anastasia Steele but I was not too impressed with Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey.,1

123,"Excellent movie. Great actors. Sexual, interesting, keeps you on the edge. haven't read the book so didn't have any expectations. Would definitely watch it again!",1
124,"As I sat there and the movie was ending, there were shouts of ""Oh come on, that's it?"" Obviously there were quite a few that had not read the book. Yes that is where the book end in all it's dramatic glory, but it not the end of the story. I encouraged many to read it all. Taking it for what it is, Fifty Shades is a very creative twist on the Twilight story. The movie, although a little rushed in parts, played out much like the book. Dakota Johnson filled her role with pizzazz. Jamie Dornan was pretty good. He fit the role physically, but I felt he could have done better. Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay were adorable at playing there respective mother roles. I wish there was a little more Mia and Ray. I did like how they put a little of Christian's background in there. It's definitely sexually charged. It is not a family movie. On that note, to those saying it is a relationship based on rape. Yes, there are moments where he gets a little violent but it was consensual and she had a safe word. When she said 'no', that was it, end of story. The 'nice to know you' and 'another cosmo' scenes were my favorite. I don't know if there are any plans to make the sequels, but I know from the responses in the theatre, it would make a lot of non-readers happy to know that it isn't the end, it gets much better. More drama in store and both Christian and Ana have some growing to do. Overall, the movie was as I expected. No more.",1
125,"The movie was able to capitalize on the book with grace and some class. The book contained odd sex scenes and some humiliating diction, while the book centered on the foggy plot line. There is a story in the 50 shades trilogy and the first book is definitely the weakest.  The movie tries to show the love story that is present and it does so without the ""dirtiness."" The movie is for fans based off a beloved book.",1
126,"It was great, loved it, Jamie and Dakota were completely fantastic. It was a great book to film adaptation, and i cannot wait for Fifty Shades Darker.",1
127,"I started to read book 2 years ago but i could never finish the book due to lack of time. as well i read the german version.. but what I like from the film is the actor and the actress are all both new faces, and it brings a lot of imagination to audience.",1
128,"Okay where do I start?! this movie is brilliant! I loved EVERY moment. A lot of people have given the movie a really bad review with a low rating but I rate this movie a 10 out of 10!. I do believe that the users who left rubbish reviews expected more detail but they need to understand there is a difference between a book and a movie. Books contain a lot more detail than movies! I particularly think that people have left rubbish reviews because the dirty scenes were not shown in a lot of detail but WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE WANT???! if you want to see more sex then you are better off sitting at home on PORN-HUB. Christian was absolutely gorgeous! and so was Anastasia! the acting was brilliant, the movie was exactly like the book so I don't see why people are  complaining, YOU WATCHED WHAT YOU READ, so what is the difference!? people expect too much.This movie was totally worth and I will happily go again!.",1
129,"There is only so much you can put into a movie. I felt that they hit all of the main points. Some felt that there was a lack of chemistry, but there needs to be an awkwardness between Christian and Ana. They are opposites in many ways and yet they are attracted to each other. She shows the hope and naivety that he lacks. He, in many ways, is like a newborn. He has so many firsts with her...more actually. There is something beautiful about this story (when you go through all 3 books). I'm a fan of Dornan and Johnson. I loved that you could hear Melanie's giggle in Dakota's giggle. So many similarities.",1
130,"The movie is perfect !!! The first time I saw In Russian translation and the translation is awful. Then I watched the original one!!! It is all emotions and sensations !!! Jamie and Dakota have perfect chemistry !!! I would like to see Christian more warm in sex scenes, but it does not matter because the movie is just amazing !!! I like the way Dakota talks!!! Both Jamie and Dakota are hot and sexy, and their voices either !!! They are just made up for this roles!!! Since the first time I saw the trailer, I said Dakota is perfect Ana !!!! After I have watched the movie my expectations are really satisfied !!! Jamie also approved that he is a great actor and can create complex characters !!! Actually I am speechless !!! I am ao amazed that words are not enough to describe my feelings!!! I do not understand bad critics, it seemed that they are jealous of the movie success !!! I agreee that the book is not written in good English , but the storyline, the characters and all make me forget about the language !!!! Moreover, there is no women abuse or rape !!! Christian never does things that Ana does not approve or says NO. Even at the end of the first book, when Ana leaves Christian, he wants to get into the elevator but Ana says NO and Christian does not move!!! In some points the movie is much more better than the book , because  the movie shows bold and brave Ana, and I like that Ana does not cry too much in the movie !!!! The movie creates the right atmosphere and you go deep into the story !!! I am in love with the Fifty shades of Grey book and movie !!! I am looking forward for Fifty shades Darker !!!",1
131,Hot damn... this movie. It is hot and steamy and I could relate to it. Good thing my mom decided not to watch it with me because this is definitely meant to be watched alone or with your partner. The soundtrack was amazing and added to the intensity of it all. I have to read the books now to see what really went down and what's next. I will be looking forward to watching the sequels.,1
132,"Christian Grey would have been an easier man to understand if he'd been a conventional hero, fighting for his beliefs. The fact that he was flawed - a drinker, a gambler, a womanizer, driven by greed and a lust for high living - makes his life an enigma.Here is a man who saw his chance at the beginning of World War II and moved to Nazi-occupied Poland to open a factory and employ Jews at starvation wages. His goal was to become a millionaire. By the end of the war, he had risked his life and spent his fortune to save those Jews and had defrauded the Nazis for months with a munitions factory that never produced a single usable shell.Why did he change? What happened to turn him from a victimizer into a humanitarian? It is to the great credit of Sam Taylor-Johnson that his film ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" does not even attempt to answer that question. Any possible answer would be too simple, an insult to the mystery of Grey's life. The Holocaust was a vast evil engine set whirling by racism and madness. Grey outsmarted it, in his own little corner of the war, but he seems to have had no plan, to have improvised out of impulses that remained unclear even to himself. In this movie, the best he has ever made, Taylor-Johnson treats the fact of the Holocaust and the miracle of Grey's feat without the easy formulas of fiction.The movie is 184 minutes long, and like all great movies, it seems too short. It begins with Grey (Jamie Dornan), a tall, strong man with an intimidating physical presence. He dresses expensively and frequents nightclubs, buying caviar and champagne for Nazi officers and their girls, and he likes to get his picture taken with the top brass. He wears a Nazi party emblem proudly in his buttonhole. He has impeccable black market contacts, and he's able to find nylons, cigarettes, brandy: He is the right man to know. The authorities are happy to help him open a factory to build enameled cooking utensils that army kitchens can use. He is happy to hire Jews because their wages are lower, and Grey will get richer that way.Grey's genius is in bribing, scheming, conning. He knows nothing about running a factory and finds Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a Jewish accountant, to handle that side of things. Steele moves through the streets of Krakow, hiring Jews for Grey.Because the factory is a protected war industry, a job there may guarantee longer life.The relationship between Grey and Steele is developed by Taylor-Johnson with enormous subtlety. At the beginning of the war, Grey wants only to make money, and at the end he wants only to save ""his"" Jews. We know that Steele understands this. But there is no moment when Grey and Steele bluntly state what is happening, perhaps because to say certain things aloud could result in death.This subtlety is Taylor-Johnson's strength all through the film. His screenplay, by Kelly Marcel, based on the novel by E.L. James, isn't based on contrived melodrama. Instead, Taylor-Johnson relies on a series of incidents, seen clearly and without artificial manipulation, and by witnessing those incidents we understand what little can be known about Grey and his scheme.We also see the Holocaust in a vivid and terrible way. Taylor-Johnson gives us a Nazi prison camp commandant named Mrs. Grey (Marcia Gay Harden) who is a study in the stupidity of evil. From the veran da of her ""villa,"" overlooking the prison yard, she shoots Jews for target practice. (Grey is able to talk her out of this custom with an appeal to her vanity so obvious it is almost an insult.) Mrs. Grey is one of those weak hypocrites who upholds an ideal but makes herself an exception to it; she preaches the death of the Jews, and then chooses a pretty one named Kate (Eloise Mumford) to be her maid and falls in love with her. She does not find it monstrous that her people are being exterminated, and she is spared on her affectionate whim. She sees her personal needs as more important than right or wrong, life or death. Studying her, we realize that Nazism depended on people able to think like Jeffrey Dahmer.Shooting in black and white on many of the actual locations of the events in the story (including Grey's original factory and even the gates of Auschwitz), Taylor-Johnson shows Grey dealing with the madness of the Nazi system. He bribes, he wheedles, he bluffs, he escapes discovery by the skin of his teeth. In the movie's most audacious sequence, when a trainload of his employees is mistakenly routed to Auschwitz, he walks into the death camp himself and brazenly talks the authorities out of their victims, snatching them from death and putting them back on the train to his factory.What is most amazing about this film is how completely Taylor-Johnson serves his story. The movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen. Individual scenes are masterpieces of art direction, cinematography, special effects, crowd control. Yet Taylor-Johnson, the stylist whose films often have gloried in shots we are intended to notice and remember, disappears into his work. Dornan, Johnson and the other actors are devoid of acting flourishes. There is a single-mindedness to the enterprise that is awesome.At the end of the film, there is a sequence of overwhelming emotional impact, involving the actual people who were saved by Grey. We learn that ""Grey's Jews"" and their descendants today number about 6,000 and that the Jewish population of Poland is 4,000. The obvious lesson would seem to be that Grey did more than a whole nation to spare its Jews. That would be too simple. The film's message is that one man did something, while in the face of the Holocaust others were paralyzed. Perhaps it took a Christian Grey, enigmatic and reckless, without a plan, heedless of risk, a con man, to do what he did. No rational man with a sensible plan would have gotten as far.The French author Flaubert once wrote that he disliked Uncle Tom's Cabin because the author was constantly preaching against slavery. ""Does one have to make observations about slavery?"" he asked. ""Depict it; that's enough."" And then he added, ""An author in his book must be like God in the universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere."" That would describe Taylor-Johnson, the author of this film. He depicts the evil of the Holocaust, and he tells an incredible story of how it was robbed of some of its intended victims. He does so without the tricks of his trade, the directorial and dramatic contrivances that would inspire the usual melodramatic payoffs. Taylor-Johnson is not visible in this film. But his restraint and passion are present in every shot.",1
133,"Want to make a lot of money? Write a book that lots of people hate and lots of people enjoy. Then make a movie the same way. Tap into an age old female fantasy of being submissive, total trust to a man and giving up control and being taken care of. There you go....you write a book and make tens of millions of dollars or make a movie for $50M and make $500M. Thats all it takes!",1
134,"The movie was good but not great. And here is why. If you haven't readthe books – I would not recommend seeing the movie. I really couldn'tunderstand how someone could understand what was going on. I thinkDakota Johnson did spot on job and very much portrayed the Anastasia""Ana"" like the books. I think Jamie Dornan did a good job with thematerial that he had. I think that his mysterious aura, past demons anda deeper understanding of him is revealed in book 2. My only disappointment I do thinkthat certain parts of the movie there was opportunities to fly a few more sparks. Positive, I was pleasantly surprised that there was quite a bit of wit and humor. I read the trilogy three times and understood there is no way to showthe complete story (1501 pages) in a two-hour film. So, a lot peopledidn't understand that the movie was ONLY PART 1. So right when youwere starting to get into the movie, it pretty much ended abruptly, andthe screen went black. It should of stated at that time Part 2 FiftyShades Darker coming in 2016. Universal has thankfully hired a newscreenwriter for part 2. I'm excited about that because book 2 reallygets into the guts of the story the characters and why Christian Greyis the way he is.",1
135,"Sadomasochism is not violence you idiot, go search. A submissive has all the control. She or he sets their limits. A sub tells a dom what they will allow done. A sub says when to stop. And the movie is not about Stalk, surprise is not ilegal, and Ana LOVE all that he does, she never said stop follow me. and it is a single love story, it is not moral lesson, they do right, they do wrong, they are human. It is a UNIQUE Story. Ana is testing her limits. 50 shades isn't a porno. It depicts one man's insecurity and need for control. It shows an inexperienced girl suddenly experiencing all these sensations and emotions. It shows one couple's epic love story, their pain, their lust, and their need for each other. They love each other, and their slowly admitting that to one another. If you can't see that past the physical attraction sex scenes, then you're too young to be reading this series in the first place.",1

But awh hell... :(",1
138,Loved it but Could have been 20 minutes shorter as it was a little slow in part.  I assume that was to make us feel like the female longing for more.  I think the bad reviews are from people who dont understand the people drawn to that life style.  Lisa Wilkinson proves her ignorance on understanding the character Dakota plays.  And the lead male is not a jerk... he is a product of abuse grooming and Lisa doesn't even see that... How rude and ignorant can people be.   Human behaviour is fascinating study.  Well done!,1

144,"I have not read the book but really enjoyed the film. It has a bit of everything; glamour, humour and sex. It was short and easy to watch. The cast is understated but HOT which made it all the better for me. I am looking forward to seeing the next part. Highly recommended!",1
145,"This movie blows my mind. First of all, reading the book I could not pass the first chapter. English is not my native language but I went to college and I appreciate sophisticated vocabulary . I could not believe the poor language in the book. I thought a 12 years old have written it so I was not able to read it. The only reason why I went to the theater was that I loved both trailers and the soundtrack and of course all the talking attached to the movie. I went with my girlfriends because my bf totally refused to come with me. To du stride the movie had something magical attached to it. Till this day I can't say what it was because I know this production does not qualify fior an Oscar but there is totally something magical to it. I hardly ever watch the movie fit a second time but I can't wait till it's available on dvd. I want to mention that I was very upset that the movie was qualified as soft porn.  Whoever calls it that has no idea what they are talking about. Sex scenes are very tasteful and you don't get see too much of private parts in the movie. It has never been close to a any kind of porn. Also the sex scenes are very brief and not the major plot in the movie. I know for some parts the movie doesn't make sense and makes you wonder what's really going on but it's very aintriguing and pleasant to watch. The music is outstanding and complements the story very well. Overall if you are a romantic female you might love the movie as I do, but if you are a guy expecting sine action you might get really disappointed. Another thing, anyone saying this movie is promoting domestic abuse is out of their mind because everything in the movie is consensual and presented in a really fascinating way. My favorite movie in a while, thumbs up!",1
146,"Desde a estréia do filme baseado no livro Cinquenta Tons de Cinza, que já bateu recorde de bilheteria, tenho acompanhado a reação dos fãs, afinal de contas são estes que interessa agradar, não haters, e muito menos críticos especializados que sempre detonaram a trilogia escrita sem o menor respeito. Quem sustenta qualquer produto são as pessoas que gostam. Harry Potter em 10 anos nunca ganhou um Oscar, nem de efeito especial, mudou alguma coisa? Crepúsculo por exemplo tem 50 milhões de seguidores no Facebook, e sempre foi massacrado. Pois ebtão, será que eles (esmagadora maioria elas) gostaram do filme? A resposta é que 90% sim, adorou, mas sem deixar de fazer ressalvas. Muito se falou que o filme é muito resumido, corta muita coisa do livro e tem cenas de sexo mais leves, mas a grande maioria dos fãs também entendem bem, como funciona uma adaptação para o cinema, e que isso é normal. A fidelidade do filme foi muito elogiada, o que era esperado, uma vez que a autora sempre esteve dando pitacos e decidindo detalhes nos bastidores da produção. A maior negatividade em comentários que encontrei, foi quando as paginas oficiais do livro e filme sugeriam um relacionamento com o Sr. Grey, o que mostra que o sadomasoquismo assusta muitas pessoas, e algumas desinformadas chegam a achar que se trata de violência, mas é minoria.",1

149,"My thoughts going into the movie after reading the books was that there is no way they would be able to do the sex scenes to the strength of the book, (lets face it books are always better) and they didnt, but it wasnt as weak as I thought it would be. I thought it was a great movie, well done, something we havent seen before, it was thrilling and mysterious! I cant wait for the rest of the series!",1
150,"I went to the movies last night waiting for a bad movie, and then went home surprised it was better than I expected. This isn't a remarkable movie, but it's fun enough. Dakota is really sexy and she portrayed the artsy nerd really well. Dornan was good, but less convincing than her. I think Jonathan Rhys Myers, for instance, would suit better for job. Anyway, it's a good movie. It's more romance than pure sex.",1
151,"To address a lot of the reviews stating this is glossed over domestic abuse, I have been in a relationship that was abusive to the point of having my bones broken and being emotionally and mentally terrorized.  This movie is NOTHING like an abusive relationship and doesn't in any way ""teach"" women to stay in abusive relationships.  It does however teach you to play with your partner safely, sanely and consensually.Anastasia was given a contract to go through, pages and pages of things to agree to or turn down, on top of being reminded often she could safe word out of any activity, she was really the one in control the entire time as all submissives are in the lifestyle.   Now on to the rest of it.Anastasia desperate need to be loved, accepted, wanted...how much she wanted to love him, please him, heal him and his hurt and anguish, all those emotions flying around, filling up the space between them, I felt like I was drowning in it, like...i couldnt see past the need to be loved that she felt.  The connection emotionally between the two stole the entire movie for me.  I barely even registered the BDSM play aspects at all I was so caught up in the emotional roller coaster between Anastasia and Christian.The sadness when those elevator doors closed at the end from them both was palpable.  I really hope they do end up making the other movies and I truly hope the connection between the characters isn't lost along the way if different writers or directors are brought in.",1

I think the actors portrayed the characters well and told the love story that the book is about....not the sex.  When reading the book, the imagination is free to run wild and yes it is much more erotic than the film.  I hated the ending as I hated the ending to the first book because it just makes you long for more.... So I immediately started to reread the 2nd book. Can't wait for the sequel.",1

I feel the hype in the media and all the negativity is ridiculous.  People are being way to critical.  It is fiction. It is entertainment.  I hope there are the sequels as in the trilogy.  It is a bit unnerving that some key scenes were left out and maybe the negative critics should read the book and connect the dots.,1

164,"It's inevitable to mention that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is one of the best films of 2015. It was not as painful as everyone thought. Undoubtedly  ""Jurassic World"" , ""Star Wars"" , ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Furious 7"" marked path at the box office and critical overall but this year ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" boosted by its Valentine’s Day release, have been record-breaking. Globally, this film has attracted attention for the exciting and strange love story between English Literature student Anastasia Steele and billionaire businessman Christian Grey. The erotic trilogy of books left speechless the whole world and the film was not far behind, Its quality to capture every detail of the book in real life was more attractive to attract the attention of fans and non-fans. Dakota Johnson, daughter of actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, she was pleased to execute the Anastasia Steele character, She has done it a perfect way , showing virginity , innocence and sweetness of a woman who had never been in love, she was about to graduate, had the pressure of final exams,  had to Jose  hounding her and  was about to go to a world full of dangers, alone. Jamie Dornan, after playing a serial murderer in BBC Two -The Fall, comes as a replacement of the first elected Charlie Hunnam . The question is : Would have done much better  Charlie as Christian ? I doubt it.Jamie made ​​an arduous and difficult work , fully achieve the character and that was evident. Significantly,  relationship Anastasia - Christian was moderate and closely linked to aspects of the bestseller but the relationship Dakota - Jamie has fuelled speculation that the two stars can barely stand each other’s company. So Taylor - Johnson responded openly:"" The film's biggest single asset is Dakota Johnson: gone is the book's blithering simpleton "" Interestingly , despite controversy between Sam and James , low public confidence in this project , the low apparent affinity between the main characters and the difficulty of bringing to the screen a book that revolutionized the world ,""Fifty Shades of Grey"" achievement to be one of the best films of 2015 , so Fifty Shades Darker ( 2017 ) will not have an easy road because Sam will not direct the sequel, James Foley who will be in the director's chair. The film’s single biggest asset is Johnson, who has worked hard with Marcel and Taylor-Johnson to perform a three-woman salvage job on the character of Anastasia. Gone is the book’s blithering simpleton, with her arsenal of “holy hell”s and “double crap""s and “oh my""s. Her inner goddess is, thank goodness, nowhere to be found or heard. She is at no point a quivering, moist mess, and doesn’t make the ruinous error of thinking the word “f___” is an epithet. Grey, for obvious reasons, is much more likely to Anastasia for intimacy and mystery with which it has on the books. Personally , this film from start to finish was excellent , showing an introduction of a fairy tale , a totally aggressive and an end that surprised us . E. L .James' books are enigmatically catchers for the public but the film is undoubtedly the best of the best. The sex scenes are intense thermometer , which threatens to get red hot but not reach the top,and with more participation Dakota that what Jamie. You could say that the submissive from all angles captured is about to undress while the master is not sufficiently dominant achieving momentarily deflect the camera toward her. Even when Grey, with his riding crops and cat-o’-nine-tails and Red Room of Pain, would claim otherwise, these sequences stay well within the bounds of vanilla mainstream taste. Anastasia is no walkover here and sometimes gives as good as she gets, if not better. The funniest scene – debatably the sexiest, too – has the duo sitting at either end of a glass boardroom table, while Ana whips through the contract for their experimental relationship scratching out everything she won’t consent to. The script isn’t afraid to call a spade a spade here: “Find anal fisting. Strike it out.” It's amazing boom that had the soundtrack of the movie taking on its lists Ellie Goulding , The Weeknd , Sia, among others. Music is a quiet and elegant journey that distorts good way every erotic moment of the film, making them much more tolerable to hear groans and hits constantly . The punishment of the inner goddess is very worrying and surprising , and the pain she feels , makes us mourn everyone . ""One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six"". The end of the movie is the best, leaving an open end and shaking us all with a simple "" No"". (This ending is much better than the book) There are no more words to praise the project, ""Sex, love, drama , romance , controversy , music , fame , pen and other things around to ""Fifty Shades of Grey""",1

Yes, It is a faerie tale and it is about abuse.Anastasia Steel (the knight and shiny armour) goes to the depths of hell to retrieve precious soul of an abused for ten years Christian Grey (prince in distress ).  She is an innocent virgin not by coincidence. She needs to be to get the task done.I live under rock, so I didn't know anything about the movie or the books until now (the books are not good, Anastasia's character in books is way too shallow to be trusted with this complex relationship)There is awkwardness which makes it realistic because they are both new to their  persuades.The picture is beautiful, the soundtrack amazing and acting great. Dakota Johnson, no doubt beautiful, looks refreshingly human in contrast to (sometime seen in movies like this) ""not from this earth"" Hollywood stars. Jamie Dornan is gorgeous and very lovable considering his plight.Common guys...!  Can't you appreciate being rescued for once, instead being always expected to rescue someone...? I am sure there is a guy out there holding on to his dear existence by hundred percent control and is tired of it.To those who are so angry about this movie: face your issues....please. To those who are so dismissive: check the depths of your character..please. There is room for improvement in regards to conducting our dysfunction appropriately. Don't underestimate the power of art.

171,"Two words......SEVERELY UNDERWHELMING. The plot and the concept were good (there is a concept, you must analyze and understand), but it totally failed to deliver the excitement and the adrenaline an erotic romantic should possess. Aside from that, it also failed to deliver the technical excellence. The scenes that must be highlighted were cut too short, the dialogue was bad, the acting of the supporting cast was bad, and a lot more.  It all gone wrong, which is such a shame",0
172,"Based on a book that reads as though it was written by a sex starved teenager who failed English, the film didn't have a lot to live up to. The fact that it is even passably watchable is in no small part to Taylor-Wood's direction and a half decent performance from Johnson, but the rest of this debacle is almost unwatchable, unless you want to watch it ironically and view it as a comedy. Possibly the least sexy film about sex ever made.",0
173,"I don't have a problem with nudity at all but this movie just isn't good. Beautiful actors and lavish decors but other than that it's actually prety boring. The story is flimsy, the ending blattant screams ""come and see the next installment"" and leaves you wondering if they're kidding or not. Some S/M scenes are pleasant to watch even if I'll never understand the joy of inflicting pain on someone you supposedly love. For the nicer sex scenes I'll leave it in the yellow, it's not an entirely horrible waste of time, but how some people can claim this is their favorite movie is beyond me. They must either crave S/M-sex or be willing to totally degrade themselves for a lifestyle with a sick amount of wealth in it. But to each their own of course. At least now I know what those women are so fond of.",0
176,"To little surprise, Fifty Shades managed to better than the book, but that's only a very flimsy consolation, given the extreme poorness of the source material. Everything else is rubbish from the acting to the screenplay. Casting as well, since pretty much nobody (girls included) thought Jamie Dornan to be a good choice.  It only sometimes gets saved by some beautiful shots of Seattle, which suit better an ad than a movie. This film was driven by marketing (as it was bound, to be fair) and I think it was made  to appeal to women only. And only to some women,  even, specifically girls just old enough to get permission to see this. The R rating is bloated - a couple of swear words and full frontal nudity do not make this movie explicit  at all - which was the one thing that one could like about the book.  Furthermore, not only it's not explicit, it's also not erotic. This is what happens when:1) Producers know that the movie is going to be a financial success before they even start shooting it;2) Your source material is awful.3) You change an appallingly written story whose only appeal is the erotica in it, and you make it tame. To specify: I don't judge the content of this movie or of the book. Erotica is fine and it can be as explicit as you wish. What I'm criticising is the mentality behind the corny dialogues and the number of awful choices that were made , which reflect in the film and make it totally uninteresting.",0
177,"A useless attempt to raise up another imbecile badly-made, two-part finale series book adaptation. The performances by Johnson and Dorian look forced therefore crappy. The sequence of events was intrepidly stupid. The Script? By far, one of the worsely written scripts I have seen in my life. The dialogue was cheesy and full of animalistic clichés.The only thing I can call ""slightly good"" is the way the film is shot and the music used.Overall, it's not worth of your money.",0
180,Not worth the hype it was like watching a lifetime flick. Brokeback was way more powerful in all areas of grit controversy and hardcore sex and drama. This is a commercial for rich prick travel guide. I actually thought I might have been teleported to Saudi Arabia for this much censorship in a marketed R-rated film I thought. Wow cringe worthy the amount of censorship in this day.  Also bad thy dead eyes of Christian Grey and what's her face.,0
181,"Already on first five minutes of movie you can perceive that there's not a good thing. The characters are extremely artificial and having zero-charisma. Plot is simply ridiculous, the little things as characters' timid acts are vomited in a forced-out form. The main character (Anastasia) submission is nothing more than pathetic. If creators want to approach a different theme (Sadomasochism), they should done it right, if watcher wanted a softcore porn, this person would watch it on a porn site, not on a Theather/Streaming/DVD with a cheap script sold as a serious film. You watcher, don't watch to this to know if is bad. I've watched to this and I can say: It's really bad. More than it, It's HORRIBLE.",0
182,"As guilty as I feel to admit this, I did read the book prior to seeing this (curiosity and the hype got the better of me.) By then, I felt obligated to see this simply because I'd read the book. All I can really say on this one is that it was a HUGE waste of time! The film's R-rating pretty much meant that it would have to be tamed way down compared to the book. Sure enough, it was, and the final result isn't that great. The acting was far worse than I originally anticipated. Jamie Dornan needs to pick a better speech coach next time, because I could easily tell the guy's from Ireland since the accent kept slipping through the entire time he talked. Dakota Johnson didn't do much better, as I found myself laughing to myself and the way she delivered her lines and dialogue in some parts. Overall, in the end, all this film really was is a failed attempt to adapt an erotic novel into a film that can only get so erotic due to its R-rating. In addition to that, it's just another reminder of BDSM relationships (and this film completely glorifies it!)",0
190,"Terrible, just terrible. I tried to give it a chance, but honestly, I thought the book was horrible, so how could I expect much more from the movie version? Dakota Johnson wasn't half bad as Ana, but Jamie Dornan was terrible and had no expression on his face throughout the movie. The music was cheesy and the dialogue laughable. The sex was really clinical and the leads had zero chemistry. There was no passion, no spark, nothing. Suffice it to say after this bad experience I'm not going to see the sequel.",0

194,"This ""movie"" is just complete wank drivel. The reason I say ""movie"" like that is because this is not a movie. It just isn't. Fifty Shades Of Grey is two hours of endless awkward BDSM that lacks chemistry or any kind of passion. I thought it would never end.Anastasia Steele has to interview Christian Grey because Anastasia's roommate has a cold for five minutes. The first 15-20 minutes are basically just this generic character meets character stuff and when I was supposed to feel some sexual tension between Steele and Grey, I was actually just waiting for the scene to end lol. The rest of this ""movie"" is either that awful awkward BDSM stuff or some even more awful melodrama between Grey, Steele and sometimes Steele's friends and family because every now and then some other characters need to appear on scene to tell something that doesn't even matter in the end. It's honestly just absolute tosh. At one point Grey literally says ""I'd be pleased to discover that you're naked underneath"" when he's talking about taking Steele's dress off. The dialogue is absolutely terrible, the directing is bland, the acting and casting is just absolute red anus. Am I seriously supposed to believe that a character portrayed by Dakota Johnson is this awkward, quiet and low confident woman who desperately needs a man to be able to live? Or at least that's her character for the first 30 minutes. After that she just randomly starts talking a lot more and eventually does all this BDSM stuff with Grey. Steele is not the only character in the movie though to just randomly change. Early in the movie Grey takes Steele to a hotel and tells her that he slept next to her, and then later refuses to sleep in the same bed with her because he apparently doesn't do stuff like that.Later in the movie we get two almost identical scenes of Steele and Grey flying while some popular song is playing in the background. These scenes have almost no meaning to anything, other than appealing to fans of that music genre I guess. Overall there's pretty much nothing for anyone here. I'm sure people can find a lot of BDSM elsewhere that isn't scattered throughout a two hour movie if they want to see it so bad.I guess there was a nice slow remake of a Beyonce song, and the colors in the movie looked alright. That is all!",0
195,"I watched 50 Shades of Grey last night. I gave it 2 stars out of 5! Yes, I read the book, so I think that played into my underwhelming experience, but it was REALLY bad. Every single character in this film was one-dimensional. They all felt like props, placed in a film simply to tell one simplified story. And that story kept going and going and going. No sub plots, just one. I liked the book, but I think the execution majorly fell apart in film. Some say it had entertainment value. I thought most of the raunchy scenes were strangely disjointed. I mean, were they meant to make you laugh, or get hot? I couldn't tell. Ugh.",0
196,"As I am not the target audience for fifty shades of grey nor did I read any of the books, I am married to someone who did care to read the books and has now seen the film.   As I stated before I did not read the books so I have the added benefit of judging this as just a film rather than judging it as an adaptation.This movie is not atrocious but its not good by any means.  This film is all about a relationship, regardless of what they do in there relationship, This is the key factor in this film, the most important part about it.  It was this key element that fifty shades of grey lacks. The relationship between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey was not believable at all.  The chemistry between the two actors was stiff and unbelievable.  Although Dakota's performances was the redeemable quality of this film.  It was Jaime's performance that gave the relationship it's stiff and scripted feel.  Even though I didn't read the books and I don't know what Christian Grey's character is suppose to be, I still felt his character should have had more presence on the screen, Anastasia up staged him totally when he is suppose to be the dominant one.One of the biggest complaints I heard about the book was how poorly the book was written.  This is clearly the case because the script was awful.  The dialogue, the story, and most importantly the relationship between Christian and Anastasia.  I think this film had the potential to portray this relationship and all it entails with out making an all out smut film, but by having an actor who dominates the screen, as the relationship.  Someone with more charisma.  Instead it was Anastasia who stole the scenes.I think my biggest problem with this film is the fact it would have been interesting to see this story play out the way it was suppose to.  To take this taboo subject and have it reflected in this film. I am going to give fifty shades of grey a 4 out of 10.  I recommend this if you have read the books and want to see this play out on the big screen,  unfortunately if you liked the book I think your gonna be disappointed.  Thanks for reading",0
197,"maybe if I do not read the book, I might like this movie but in my opinion this is a romantic story with maybe two 'hard' moments and don't contain lots of episodes from the book. I like watching romantic movies but this is not what I expected.  I give three because Ana's jokes were funny and Jamie is really hot guy but after reading a book it DID NOT rapture me.",0
199,"No problem that I have with the abuse or whatever you call it cuz I don't.. But what's up with the end of the movie?! Seriously, after all these discoveries and figuring what Grey's life is like, Ana has JUST felt upset ?!? Or she has only lost appetite ?",0
201,"Watched it sometime ago it appeared to me as a nice movie at first but soon came the reality and all my focus moved on the acting and it was disappointing on the side of  character ""Christian Grey"" played by ""Jamie Dornan"" while ""Dakota Johnson"" who played the character of ""Anastasia Steele""  quite okay overall because of the explicit scenes the movie was scored on the other hand there were a few moments worth remembering in the movie, at the end it appeared to me as waste of time,  music given by various artists in the movie is all i remember.",0
202,"Очень, очень, очень скучное кино. Актёры не цепляют, сюжет скучный, эротика... тоже просто скучная!Итог: Просто идите поспите, не надо смотреть этот фильм.",0
203,"Dumb! Firstly, The actors were not right for the role. Secondly, the dialogue could have been better. And thirdly, the entire movie had a choppy feeling with no real chemistry or emotion between the characters. I could go on, but on a short note: 2 thumbs down!! Very disappointed.",0
204,this movie doesn't justify the beautiful detailed book .it really pissed me off watching the movie after reading the book .was really disappointing to know that so many important parts of the book should've been included . the only nice  thing in the movie would be the amazing sound tracks,0
205,"Not the blockbluster / shocking movie everyone was assuming it would be, but still a reasonable one.Pity that the offical sound track didn't included Britney Spears -  Hit me baby one more time :)",0
206,"Everything about this is bad. There's not chemistry between the two leads, the dialogue is painful, and the screenplay is horribly written. Fifty Shades of Grey is the worst thing since the Twilight films.",0
209,"Love the Book not the movie. He is borderline Christian's character shoe is spot on. Too much is cut out, book to movie. Sequence is screwed up as well! Book excited you, movie board you! Important parts cut out, changed or eliminated. Not pleased.",0
210,"Una de las películas que he esperado con más ansias y la que más me ha defraudado.  Excesivamente predecible, carente de emosión y ABURRIDISIMA.  En una sola palabra UN FIASCO.",0
211,"Here comes a better version of twilight, but once again a book to movie adaptation falls in almost every way. Its just a reason to see two actors have sex with each other, thats the only reason anyone went to see the movie.",0
212,BoringPoor StoryAnd a nice way to waste your time...I really don't get it how some people like this movieit has to explain that kind of sexual interest but it is making it worse...,0
213,"There is zero chemistry with the main characters and the plot is terrible. I don't know how anyone could possibly get an enjoyable experience out of this movie, other than making fun of it.",0
214,"I can't remember when I've seen a worse movie... nothing much here for you unless you just want to know about sadomasochism, which perhaps a lot of people are curious about, considering how many people read the book... then watch away! You might enjoy it if you are fascinated by the field of abnormal psychology. Sad to think people crave being abused or abusing others in order to feel sexually satisfied, so one can be compassionate for the characters. I just thought the character development was weak.",0
215,"This movie promised something and did not deliver. We, as an audience, were promised kinky BDSM and rough sex, but instead were presented with mild sex scenes and some mild spanking. I wish i could say the characters are likable but that would be false. One of our main characters, Christian Grey, is stiff and somewhat of a stalker. Its obvious many people are giving this a pass because he's rich, Anastasia Steele included. This movie is a tease to viewers and an insult to women.",0
216,I would never recommend this porno to anyone I know. Christian Grey is a manipulative and possessive stalker who throws a tantrum towards Ana if he doesn't get what he wants. Please don't be like Christian! This is glorification of abusive relationships disguised as a love story and it's psychologically disgusting. It's really sad to know that its box office earns more than 500 million dollars.,0
218,"Is there any sex in this movie?, yes, the film contains its healthy doses of sex but in the end 50 Shades Of Grey turns out to be more a romantic film with a little darker plot inclined to some sexual depths.Beyond that there isn't really nothing more to rescue, although I respect the technical and sober style, the film is only a forgettable note, like many other films of this style.Enjoyable for couples who may find the subject interesting or women who enjoy this kind of stories, men should abstain, if they want to get excited they should better see some porn or what excites them more.",0
219,"I've never experienced a movie like this. The first act was boring, the second act was so bad it was funny, and the third act was so bad it was scary.",0
220,"Spank me like you do.This film was undoubtedly one of the biggest box office hits of the decade, but it was largely due to the already dizzying success of the original material, the erotic novels by E. L. James. I have no doubt that the audience that went to see this film did it out of curiosity or because they had previously read the books and liked it. So, the film already had a well defined target audience. But as I have not read the books (nor do I intend to) I will speak only of the film.Overall, I found the plot very weak. Anastasia Steele is a shy, sexually inexperienced young woman who immediately feels a strong attraction to Christian Gray, a young millionaire with an almost latent aggressiveness. From there, the two have a relationship full of fetishes of authority and pain, where the romance insists on arising and leaving both confused and bewildered, especially Gray, who seems to carry a lot of childhood traumas and like to discount all that on the body. of their young sex slaves. This is the plot of the film, and I am aware that the book is the same, but the truth is that it makes no sense, if we take into account the normal and expected reactions between a man and a woman ...Observe carefully: first, it is almost impossible to find, today, a young adult totally inexperienced in bed and in sex. It can happen, of course, but it is rare. The first meeting between them is also something that could only happen in a book: Anastásia, who should interview Gray, is so tense and shy that she doesn't even know what she is doing! And he, a very busy man, gives ten minutes to a young woman who has not rigorously prepared herself for the interview she wanted to do! He is an intense, even brutal man, who could have any woman, but he is enchanted by the tastiest girl on the planet. Even so, he does not intend a normal courtship, but a sexual and possession relationship, bureaucratic, well defined on paper, forgetting that quickly when the desire and passion became uncontrollable. And everything happens in a fraction of ... days? One day she is in his office, not knowing what to ask him and, a short time later, she is relaxed talking to his mother as if she were already part of the family. None of this makes sense, but this is just a bit of the absurdities of the whole story, common to the film and books.Dakota Johnson is perfect for her character, as she is a totally uninteresting woman, who could go unnoticed by the eyes of the most ardent of males. For his part, Jamie Dornan is too kind and friendly to be Christian Gray. His character should harmoniously combine the beauty and virility of a young adult with a more mature and somber personality than normal at his age and some brutality and strength of character. I even dare to think that the ideal actor for Gray should be (or appear to be) slightly older than Dornan. The rest of the cast is OK but has no room to do anything really good. The dialogues are hideous, and if they originated from the book then I did well not to read it.It goes without saying, I believe, that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the heavy erotic material and the language used. The film's nudity is something that the fans considered residual, but I would consider it too much if it did not take into account the original material in which the film. The film has good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props (it would highlight the famous red room and all its paraphernalia), satisfactory editing work and, above all, a good soundtrack, which is in the heard and has good songs (I would highlight ""Earned it"" and ""Love me Like You Do"").In short: when starting with bad source material, the film was doomed from the start. The only thing that made E. L. James's book good for the cinema was the number of copies sold and the absolute guarantee that the film would sell equally.",0
222,"What a tedious, boring catastrophe. The acting is unbearably bad, the S&M scenes were dull, and the film is terrible to the tenth degree.",0
224,"One of my favorite novels has finally came on the big screen!Well, it really was better than the novel in something:First, it was faster and non-boring like the novel.Second, it was absolutely more erotic.But it wasn't an amazing movie, 'cause it had the most dumb thing in the novel:The ending was definitely bad, I know that it was from the novel, but I didn't like it in the novel too!Well, the cast was sometimes ridiculous!So, Fifty Shades of Grey is such a good movie.The things I liked as a movie was:The cast (not beside the novel) was good, and the couple was really talented, but as a novel fan, I expected more.The sex scenes was really erotic and romantic!The story was lovely and fast.That's all the things I loved and hated about this movie, and I think that the reviews was really unfair and hard on it!",1
225,I am one of the few people who liked the first installment of the Fifty Shades trilogy. Dakota Johnson was a likable character and the film had decent drama. May not be the best film but is for sure a watch again movie on Valentine's Day.,1
226,"What can i say.It is based on Twilight which is also terrible thing.But still this is even worse.It's not like i don't watch it because i'm a male.I cannot imagine somebody enjoying this movie.The protagonists are atrocious, one of them is a psychopath and the other one is dumb as hell because he tells her multiple times to go away because he is not good for her, infact this man isn't good for any woman on the earth and she still insists even though she does not even know him.But if you are insomniac then you will fall asleep with it easily.",0
227,"Cringe worthy , poor acting , strange how the movie has so much hype but feels awkward to watch",0
228,"The best movie! It’s not simple porn like some people say, even if you disappear all the explicit scenes the story is great.",1
229,"Fantastic movie I'm sure after watching only first part you will fall in love with Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey There are also very wonderful, beautiful love story",1
