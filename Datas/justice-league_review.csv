2,"This movie was indeed fun and actually satisfied the comic book nerd in me with its superhero bits. Although some of the CGI and the rapid pace of action scenes were a bit letting off towards the last act, the league stands out as a whole on whose shoulders the movie marches well forward. Every character shines and makes this movie worth investing your time at the cinemas whether regardless of being a comic book fan or mainstream. Ezra's Flash was a real charm and not to mention Superman's actual moment which was the biggest USP that satisfies hardcore fans like myself.",1
3,"I give Justice League a solid B as a grade. As a comic book reader, I enjoyed the movie and I was thoroughly entertained. The movie is epic, maintains its' serious tone, and still manages to make you laugh with humor without it becoming a parody. You can definitely see Joss Whedon's additions to the movie which lightens Snyder's more serious tone. I read some of the reviews from critics and I had to wonder if we even saw the same movie.",1
4,"""Justice League"" is a rather flawed movie. Its pacing often feels rushed (thanks to Warner Bros' insistence that the movie be under 2 hours), the CGI is painfully obvious (some of the post-production work on Clark's face is meme bait), and Steppenwolf isn't exactly a villain to write home about. That said, it's also got plenty of entertainment value. It's considerably lighter than Zack Snyder's other two DCEU films, the characters all have good chemistry with one another and are given their own moment to shine, and it's exciting in that ""superheroes coming together to save the world"" way, much like ""The Avengers"" was. If you've dreamed your whole life of seeing the Justice League come together on the big screen, you're unlikely to be disappointed, so long as you adjust your expectations.",1
6,"Movie was really fun! Plot is nothing to write home about, but the heroes make the movie. I feel liie many of the critic's reviews are overly harsh. I was pleasantly surprised.",1
7,"This was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a very long time, and has to be my favorite super hero movie of the year. The atmosphere and cinematography were top notch. Reshoots and CGI could perhaps have been better in places, but in what movie in this decade isn't that the case? I also missed the Zimmer music in places it would have fit nicely, including the cornfield scene where one of the Man of Steel pieces was used. That's all that really bothered me, other than the film could have perhaps been longer. Batman was a pleasure to watch. Wonder Woman has several amazing moments. The Flash was funny and endearing. Aquaman managed to actually make me interested in his upcoming film, and that alone is a feat, as he was never a character that interested me. A certain someone was the 'S'tar of it all, as I believe was always intended, and more how people wished him. Steppenwolf served his purpose of being a menacing plot device to frame the formation of the League, also.Just seeing the League interact on screen, and mythical heroes duking it out in ways and on a scale you just don't see elsewhere, was a pleasure. I plan to see the movie several more times.",1
8,"The beginning of the movie is a bit bumpy but when the movie starts to pick up, it really does shine. The chemistry between the members of the Justice League and how they work together is amazing to see on the big screen. The cgi for Steppenwolf looks straight from a video game. If you thought Ares in Wonder Woman was bad, this is even worst but seeing them beat the **** out of him makes it up. This is a lot more lighter in tone compared to the other DC movies and its definitely in the right direction. There is some hints of studio meddling by making them cut it down to around 2 hours which ruins the pacing of the film. The scene stealers have to be Jason Mamoa as Aquaman and Ezra Miller as The Flash and someone else which I cannot say to avoid spoilers. There is a particular scene where The Flash and this person interacts that had the whole theater roaring in laughter like how the Hulk interacted with Loki in The Avengers. The score is a really big treat for this film. Danny Elfman incorporates themes of the past that we are familiar with into this score like the original Superman theme and of course Tim Burtons Batman theme. This is a really fun movie and I highly recommend people to give it a try even if they thought the last couple movies were lame because this movie is getting a bunch of bad rep due to the critics score. Do not let bias pre meditated opinions dictate your choice of seeing this film just because you love Marvel more than DC. You can like both and it is possible. Thor Ragnorak was a fun ride and I enjoyed it and Justice League is also a really fun ride also. PS: There is 2 stinger after credit scenes at the end.",1
9,"Justice League is a team movie, and the team in here works in a great way, every single one have his moments, the movie introduces the new characters quickly and well. This movie shows the hero in there more pure way, caring about the people and saving them. the action scenes, the league working together are just wonderful to watch. The story is simple, the villain is nothing new, although that i like it, it semmed like a semi-boss, felt threatening and you believed that he could destroy all members of the league, almost. The movie shows hope and optimism, a lot of jokes and light moments that worked well in the most. I really enjoyed watching this movie and when i get out of the movie theater i was just smilling around.",1
10,"Its incredible how they take this seriously but without being dark.The animated series in movie form, every character has its time to shine and doesnt feel repetitive.It proves that it doesnt have to be dumb or full of jokes to be good.",1
11,"A beautiful adventure with good performances, especially of Flash and superman, there is still much of Snyder dingy, and scenes run needlessly, but holds the hope of a better future for Dc.",1
12,"I seriously don't know what movie the critics saw, but it couldn't have been this one. The character interactions were great, and if you're a comic book fan, you'll like it. My only real grips were that the cgi was bad in some places, and that the movie could have been longer to help flesh out the story.",1
13,"wonder woman the flash show very good movie too fast intro is not memorable, bad villain is not bad Overall, a fun movie i love the batman very so much",1
14,Movie it s not perfect but it s good. This is a proper super hero movie not that Thor ragnarok parody of comedy. Stepenwolf is good vilian. but this fiht OMG  hell yes.,1
15,Justice League is so awesome! You will love every character and Superman... I mean he is amazing and The Flash and Aquaman are scene stealers. It's a must watch,1
16,"Don't listen to the Marvel fans. This movie is great, tons of fun and LOTS of action. The characters are great and the story is fast-paced. The Flash steals the show and Aquaman is no longer a joke. Batman and Wonder Woman are always great and Superman.... Well, you'll just have to see it for your self. You can't ask for a better time at the movies!",1
17,"Justice League is the culmination of a grand total of three movies (Discounting Suicide Squad), where our beloved DC characters band together and forms the eponymous league. It offers bite-sized bits of fun in its action and character dialogue, but ultimately proves to be a clumsy attempt at brightening up the atmosphere of Snyder's DC universe. It is unrewarding and shallow at anything it tries to explore.-THEME-The film opens with an amateur recording of Cavill's Superman, offering his cheerful wisdom (of which he had none in his previous two films) in a dialogue about hope and car keys, suggesting that the central theme of the movie is hope. And since his passing in BvS, the world was rocked into anxiety and distress.This theme, however, was never explored any further. The movie never shows the emotion of hope draining or rejuvenating our characters. In the end, the movie has no theme to revolve around, resorting instead into a mindless fight of good and evil, where our heroes race to stop Steppenwolf in his conquest to gather three loot boxes and destroy the earth... for no reason other than ""because I am Steppenwolf"".-CHARACTERS-Steppenwolf himself proved to be a very forgettable wet blanket of a villain, with one-note dialogue that revolves around the words ""box"" and ""destroy"". He does not provide the protagonists with moral or philosophical quandary.On the other hand, a few of our protagonists (specifically Miller’s Barry Allen, Gadot’s Wonder Woman, and Momoa’s Aquaman) provided the movie with its better parts. The movie is at its strongest points when it explores their characters, allowing us glimpses into the kinds of people each of the Leaguers are. This endeavour proved shallow because none of them were never really presented with a conflict that challenges their beliefs. Having spent much of their earlier screen time as friends who have nothing to challenge the others about, the culmination of the story fizzles unrewardingly as they “finally” unite against their common foe. There is no buildup, no lessons learned by anyone, that led to this point.Much like Wonder Woman in BvS, Superman felt like an item on a checklist. His resurrection was – say it with me – unrewarding. The impact of his death was not explored sufficiently. The impact and consequences of his resurrection seemed trivial. Justice League was an unrewarding experience, and if you don’t care enough for action blockbusters or superero films, you’re off not spending any time and money for this movie. Snyder/DC’s diehard fans will still find some things to enjoy in this movie.",0
18,"Heart, dedication, flaw and even more heart. Justice League is brighter, bolder and simpler; but what it lacks in grandiose subtlety, it makes up with in tiny details. The compassion of Wonder Woman, Batman's courage, Flash's earnesty, Aquaman's raw power and Cyborg's determination. The leaguers all struggle with their own darkness but together, they're mighty. And that's how it is with this movie as well. Noticeable flaws, compensated by powerful moments and some touches of genius. Snyder's determination is evident, as he and the cast combine to produce a dedicated performance that shines even through Joss Whedon's honestly appalling reshoots and vulgar humour. Plagued by a meh villain, a rushed plot and some deus ex machina; Justice League is buoyed by five determined performances, great character interactions and one, VERY incredible Superman.A must watch for all.",1
19,i just want to see Superman and it is EPIC Superman is a badassSuperman is a badassSuperman is a badassSuperman is a badassSuperman is a badass--------------------------------------,1
20,"It is the dream of every DC fan and does not deserve the low score that the critics are giving him.Yes, it has its flaws (poor CGI, many scenes cut and some reshoots are noticed) but it is not to be criticized so much.The movie is very enjoyable and fun thanks to the action and its characters.I emphasize more than anything 2 scenes of action that I loved that was SteppenWolf vs. The Amazons and the Final Fight.It has many incredible easter eggs.Comedy does not feel forced.Cyborg stands out a lot.The appearance of Superman is impressive.To see it in 3D.",1
21,"Walking out of the movie theatre one can see two kinds of people, ones liked the Justice league and ones who dont want to. Am not saying that one is going to be dazzled by some cinematic brilliance, but not liking Justice league is improbable for an honest movie goer.",1
23,"This is a great Justice League Movie.   If you love these characters and care about these characters you're going to love this movie.  If you never liked the Justice League this movie isn't going to change your mind.  I thought it was great. It has many of the strengths of Wonder Woman.  They're not trying to reimagine these characters, they're simply recreating them on the big screen.  I'm not really impressed with what the critics have said.  This is a big fancy comic book movie.  Enjoy it for what it is.  The character moments are great.  The actions scenes are fantastic.  Just go and enjoy it.  I did!",1
24,Very bad CGI. Very bad plot and forgettable mashup of heroes with no chemistry between them. Terrible action even worst then in BatmanvSuperman. Very bad not interesting villian.,0
27,"In a rushed 2-hour extravaganza of ugly visuals, terrible CGI, and a terribly predictable plot, Justice League manages to be the next piece of this dying extended universe, instead of being the movie supposed to revitalize it. An abysmal villain, terribly noticeable reshoots, forgettable soundtrack, wooden characters and establishing sequels: I thought we've gone past these kinds of superhero movies. Watch it once, and proceed to forget about it, because trust me: You will.",0
28,"Something's wrong when you have a production budget of $100M+ and you can't make a film that's all 9s and 10s. The VFX are great but you don't win on that alone. I think we've reached a point in film making where the storytelling and acting just cannot keep up with the amazing VFX and that's why you see all the disappointment with this movie experience, and why people are saying so much of it is laughable - there's an imbalance that's going to take a film genius to correct.",0
29,"Liga da Justiça, um dos mais aguardados filmes de Super Heróis de 2017 e após ver tantas criticas não positivas ao filme fiquei preocupado. No entanto ao ver o filme fico surpreendido do porque de tantas criticas. É certo que o facto de nem todos os personagens terem os seus próprios filmes e de não termos acesso a filmes solo do Aquaman e de Cyborg por exemplo leva-mos a não compreender no todo os personagens. A junção do grupo em si tem de ser compreendida desde o inicio de Man of Steel e passando por Esquardão Suicida onde todos os pormenores contam. Apesar de tudo achei Justice League o melhor filme da DC no que toca á junção do grupo e desenvolvimento do inicio da história não sendo tão mau como a junção do Esquadrão Suicida que foi simplesmente péssimo. Voltando agora a cara para o vilão, eish o grande problema do filme. A liga da justiça merecia um vilão 10x melhor, mais forte, carismático e que metesse mais medo. Stepwolf não tem nada disso e bastou o superhomen chegar para levar uma tareia brutal. Simplesmente ridiculo. No entanto as cenas de luta melhoraram o que é bom e foram em ambiente um pouco mais claro que o costume. Para finalizar a mulher Maravilha de Gal Gadot continua sendo brilhante e o melhor deste filme.",1
30,This is the worst DCEU movie so farWhedon and Elfman **** up this movie so hard,0
31,"This movies is so bad, that you can see it from the first minutes. DC universe is dead before even been born.",0
34,Not the worst movie ever but definitely a huge pile of problems. The main problem with this movie is I don't think they ever figured out what movie they were making. It feels like every scene was borrowed from other movies and done worse. DCEU needs a reboot because there are some great stories but the current film makers are really bad at almost every aspect of film making it just needs to end before it gets worse. Wonder Woman will probably stay the only good DCEU film to date.,0
35,I lasted 15 minutes before turning it off. I’m actually amazed some people watched the entire film. I feel sorry for anyone who watched it. I’m incredulous as to how this movie was green lit.,0
36,"A crossover without proper build up. Unlike in Avengers, they dont have a proper goal. Villains are also forgettable. The connection between the DC movies are non existent (except Bat and Sup). Ugh. Terrible. Just plain awful.",0
37,"Snyder is a horrible writer, but an excellent director. Justice League is the perfect example of this. The dialogue is cliche, the relationship between characters is unsatisfying given it's the entire point of a film to be a team. The plot is childish at best. Godot and Miller give excellent performances but they can't hold up the entire film on their own.",0
39,"There are so many things wrong with this movie. It is very cheesy, has horridly forgettable characters, a bland villain, is extremely predictable and unlike the other DC movies who had those problems, is rarely fun to watch. The CGI is also laughable. It's one of the only movies I've ever watched that I'd rather just stare at the blank screen than watchRating- 9%",0
40,"Yeah, this movie is not a 'masterpiece'. it has some editing flaw, some problem. but that's not mean this is trash. to me, this is acceptable flaw. movie was very enjoyable, and not bad as critic says. I enjoyed thor:ragnarok, as much as Justice league too.  If this movie has more than 2 hours, that Warner bros limited to director as I heard about, Might be a become more great movie I guess. after watched movie, I wanna see director's cut now.",1
41,"Sulle spalle di JL c'è un'eredità pesante. Una serie di film non propriamente coinvolgenti che hanno reso parecchia gente prevenuta su questo film...che però a me ha convinto. Ho trovato la trama solida, tranne un paio di cose abbastanza sconcertanti, ed i personaggi vecchi e nuovi ben inseriti nel discorso, senza forzature. Certo alcune cose vanno ancora migliorate, ma sono molto soddisfatto di come si stanno evolvendo i film basati sulle licenze DC Comics",1
42,"This is an exciting, effects driven movie, with fine performances and superior production values.  If you are looking for well-realized escapist entertainment as a way to spend a couple of hours, “Justice League” is just the ticket.",1
43,"Though visually it may be ugly, it also is very entertaining, empathetic and easy to understand.",1
44,"I was aprehensive about JL when I saw the reviews, but I was going anyway to see it...so glad I did! I can't believe the negative 'Pro-Marvel' critics, it just shows how biased they can be. I really enjoyed this film! Characters are really good, especially Wonder Woman who is fabulously played by Gal Gadot. The Flash is brilliant as the nerdy kid superhero, who gives a lighter and humourous touch to the film. I really liked the way Superman was brought in and made more of a darker character who actually 'kicks ass'! Despite the change of director part way through, I think they have done really well with JL. Well worth a watch!",1
45,"It's a star-studded affair and it shows with the little solo time afforded to some of the characters. Unfortunately this also means little time was allocated to setting a bit more of a story or delve into the personalities of our troubled superheroes. Maybe this was saved for some of the solo films coming up? This however makes us relate to each character a little less than what I would have liked. In saying this, all in all, it met all expectations of a DC franchise film. What I think I mean by this, is that past DC films have a distinct ""comic book"" feel to them. The camera shots/scenes are somewhat eery at times, the characters (superheroes) spend a lot of time in costume, fly around quite a bit and kick a whole lot of ass. And is it just me, or do DC Superheroes tend to fight like a million underlings (and one main villain) when we compare it to the likes of an X-Men or Deadpool? The camera angles were good, dialogue fair and CGI overused (sadly the norm for a lot of films these days and probably not a criticism on Justice League's shoulders alone). What would have made this brilliant for me, would have meant spending couple more minutes on character development - heck, why not the villain as well. Slowing down some of the scenes and getting some dialogue with substance or dramatic pauses. Hoping Zack Snyder can build on this a little or maybe someone else can give it a bash...?",1
46,"I don't know what critics were thinking, but all of Y'all haters are missing the point because the Justice League Movie is dope in my opinion. I highly recommend it!",1
49,"""Justice League"" is everything a good superhero movie is not: broken character introductions, a lifeless script, terrible visuals, a confusing plot, joyless acting...",0
50,"The worst DCEU movie so far. I can't believe how the DCEU has the ability to ruin comic book cinematic events, with Batman v Superman, they ruined what should've been the most awaited moment for comic book fans, the comic book crossover of the century, and they turned it into a pretentious, boring, convoluted mess of a movie and now with Justice League they ruined what should've been THE comic book crossover of the century and turned it into a convoluted, unfunny, cheap-looking, boring movie.But it was kind of expected, the DCEU was already ruined and all the messes they made with previous movies would naturally make this movie turn out to be pretty bad.The pacing is just horrible, the plot is generic and cliché (Oh, the villain has to get an item that will make him destroy the universe how creative), there's no character development, the Justice League has zero chemistry and there's no conflict. Like, everyone is just okay with being a team now, they're all happy and good friends now and will destroy Steppenwolf together. Steppenwolf is one of the most generic and cliché villains I've ever seen since Apocalypse from X-Men Apocalypse, I swear 99% of his lines are cliché villain lines and even the way the actor portrays him is cliché and cartoonish.The CGI is TERRIBLE and makes Cyborg look awkward to watch, and you might say it's not that bad but it is considering the HUGE budget this movie was made with.Batman is wasted and that's one of the worst things in this movie, Batman was awesome in Batman v Superman and was one of the only goof things about that movie but here, he's just there, he doesn't do anything, he barely has any screentime when he's in the Batman suit.Nothing about this movie is good and it's one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen, I expected so much from this movie and that just makes my feelings about this movie even worse. I don't give it a 0/10 because that's only reserved for movies that I seriously can't watch.",0
51,"Justice League not only satisfies causal fans, but it allows fun for everyone. Sure, Batman is a murderer, and Superman is dead, but there's just so much FUN. Sure, I'm not that big of a fan, but this movie made me a fan. Zack Snyder is the greatest director since Steven Spielberg. He has not only directed 3 films for this universe, but he also got kicked off of one. If that's not cool, I don't know what is. What a LEGEND. Ok, now to the movie. I don't know why Superman's face looked odd, but you can tell they worked really hard on the CGI. Like. yeah, it's amazing and all. It just could've been better, at least it was better than THANOS. Like, who wants to waste 300 million dollars on Thanos, when you can waste, I mean use, it on a mustache. Also, the story is great. To be honest, I couldn't really follow what happened, and yeah, I almost feel asleep, but these are such MINOR complaints. Next, the actors were great. Ben Affleck and Henry C are done as their heroes, but it's because they wanted to go out on a high note. Some sources are speculating that they are leaving because they want to be in better films, but what better films are there. It's all happening right here at DC. Lastly, the action was just great. At first, when the film started, I though that a video game cutscene was playing, but it was just Batman jumping around. But, again, this is just a MINOR complaint. In the end, PLEASE WATCH AND SUPPORT THIS FILM. DON'T SEE SOMETHING LIKE CAPTAIN MARVEL, WHICH IS JUST A COPY OF WONDER WOMAN, a terrible film btw, BUT HIS IS SUCH A MINOR COMPLIANT. With love, DcShill12",1

89,"This is the only DCEU film where I disagree with the critics. It is a good movie, though I can't say its awesome. The plot is well done and the action is there, together with a bright but serious tone. Perhaps another problem with this movie, as with many other DCEU  movies, is that many characters were not properly introduced yet and the DCEU is indeed rushing too much to compete with Marvel. The villain is also not so well known, which may be a problem. However I can only give it a 7 because many scenes from the trailer were ommitted. Still you are going to enjoy this movie though and I believe the DCEU is improving.",1
91,"""Sound and Fury... signifying nothing"", completely empty, no feeling, whatever the opposite of 'thought-provoking' is. It's fitting that the characters are half-cgi, and Steppenwolf is all cgi - to signify how plastic it is. The whole story is just some randomness to create a pretext for violence and explosions, and to give the characters an excuse to pose and say one liners. The casting is all terrible too - everyone is totally forgettable and can be swapped out without being missed, and completely wrong for their roles.",0
93,"This movie was a terrible disappointment. Quality of CGI is surprisingly low, acting was wooden, the plot is completely cookie-cutter and the interactions between the characters lack any depth and are simply a chain of trite tropes stringing the viewer along to the mercifully funny ending. The antagonist is completely generic and quite frankly, this movie acts more of a poorly thought out resurrection device than anything else.",0
94,"It definitely wasn't bad. First off, I don't know what was the deal between Zack Synder and WB Entertainment, but they did ruined a possibly great movie. Overall it's decent, the pace was quite a mess at the beginning, but the final battle turns out to be quite a fun to watch one. The Wonder Woman rescues hostages sequence in the movie was freaking gold, Gal Gadot is literally WW now. All the other actors also did a great job, they deserve a better director and script writer.",1

104,"It feels like watching a movie of 2 halves, one half is trying to be dark and edgy, keeping the tone of the previous DCU movies but then you have the far too upbeat flash come in and drop one liners every time he opens his mouth. Imagine watching the Godfather but now in all the quiet sober moments include Adam Sandler at one side of the screen making a fart joke or shouting out ""ohhhh maaaayyyyyyy gawwwwwwwddddddddddd"" at the goings on from the rest of the scene. That's how jarring Justice league feels as it was torn from Zacks hands and tried in vane to inject some colour and humour into a absolute disaster of a film.Also I found myself wanting to shout at the screen when Aquaman keeps calling Bruce Wayne Batman in front of around 100 civilians and again later when people insist on calling Superman Clark in front of people who don't know his identity, one of the people who calls him it is Lois Lane... the person who recently lost her work mate called Clark Kent the same day that Superman died... it wouldn't take a super villain genius to put 2 and 2 together, although as Warner Brothers showed us... sometimes you can take 2 and 2 and just get a mess when you put them together.",0

108,"Justice League is not a flop. The main members of the league are enticing against a weaker villain, which was more menacing at the start and in some interrogation scenes. The twist of bringing superman back actually got me, and seeing the green lantern was AMAZING, but I feel like we could've had a better villain. Mamoa brought a good edge to aquaman, and miller and fisher did amazing jobs for their roles. The film needed to be longer I think. The humor worked 40% of the time, other times it felt almost like awkward dialogue. Personally I think that the batman in this film was not as good as the BvS batman in some senses. I really liked the ""frank millerie"" batman from BvS and that bruting warrior for justice sense. In this film, he is more witty, which is fine, but his jokes moved from dark to almost slapstick, which broke the character for me, but I still think Batfleck is the best on screen batman ever. Henry Cavil is now only one more good film away for tieing with christopher reeves with me for the best superman. His ending jokes and giggles provide a great sense of hope to him, which was needed. The flaws are already said by everyone else so pick that apart to your liking. The movie is fun, it was good, and I would wait for the directors cut if your really skeptical.",1
109,"A compelling yet ultimately flawed movie, it deserves a lot of praise for its action, characters and world building. However the Villain Steppenwolf is a bore, and the CGI looks very cheap at times.The first 1/3 of the movie feels very rushed, and the characters are given little room to expand. With some hilariously cringy dialogue. Lois Lane and Martha Kent are particularly pointless at this point.  The 2/3 has some great action, great character interaction and reintroduces Superman in a much more positive manner. He is great in this one, despite the ccasionaly noticable phantom moustache, and the way he destroys the rest of the justice league is entertaining, albeit making the league a bit redundant. The league at this point haven't all reached their full potential yet(Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg).  The finale is a lighthearted spectacle, with genuinely endearing moments between characters, and an almost too easy final fight. In many ways it's not great, but I was thoroughly entertained for most of it, and I was never bored.  I would love to see a directors cut which expanded on some of the characters, had more emotional moments, better music in some sections, and a darker tone which was established by man of steel and Batman vs Superman, with some levity. I hope DC takes its characters in a darker direction, but not to the point of it being crushing and oppressively boring, like with some moments in BvS. This film feels like it has less ambition and I wish it could have had more. However all in all a fun, entertaining ride which has a lot of spirit, and leaves me excited for whats to come.",1
111,"I guess I must be a real critic then. The grim parts don't work and the jokes are tacked on. Perhaps next time they could work on putting some plot together, have an interesting villain and use characters effectively.",0
112,"Complete and utter crap. I wasn't the biggest fan of Batman v. Superman but this just takes the prize for worst movie in the DCEU (not counting Suicide Squad since that was barely a movie to begin with). Given a budget of $300 this should at least have been a movie worth watching, but save your money and go see something else.",0
113,"This is a tale of two halves. The first half of Justice League suffers from some of the same nagging issues its predecessors do.  It's sloppy with putting the team together and lengthy scenes of exposition just grind the film to a halt. The first half gets a low 5. Then the surprising turn happens and suddenly you start to see a vision of where these characters are heading.  The dialogue is better and as sloppy as the team forming was, the team in full gear is a lot of fun to watch. For all the problems DC has had they seemingly have gotten the team right which is most important.  The second half would get a low 8. So overall the film to me is a low 7, with the caveat that DC may finally have a blueprint from the second half to use in the future. B",1
117,"Solid movie. It has issues, but this production was really troubled. What it gets right it what it needs to. The movie is funny. The characters are likeable. It doesn't waste time on unnecessary side plots or characters.Most importantly, it understands that this is a comic book movie, and for the first time in a LONG time it finally feels like WB understands that.",1
118,"Justice League is filled to the brim with just the right amount of comic relief and DCEU nods to satisfy any fanboy. Although the film is certainly not perfect, and far from it, it makes for an entertaining adventure and doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. What BvS did wrong, Justice League mostly makes up for, but a stronger story is what this film desperately needs and the only weapon Zack Snyder doesn’t have under his belt. While normal moviegoers might find Justice League to be normal fair and nothing more than the flash and bang it viciously shows off, people who are genuine fans of the genre and backstories of the heroes will find a film that accomplishes the goal it sets out to reach.",1
119,"It´s not epic like Logan or The Dark Knight but it´s still a good movie. Positive points first. When the League finally reunites it´s exciting. The humor of the movie works. The post credit scenes are amazing and Superman comeback is simply epic (it´s not a spoiler because he was in several posters and Cavill name is in the cast list so please stop crying because Warner, Cavill himself and many others said Superman is in the movie since 2016). Negative points now. The villain is terrible. His motivations are weak, generic and his CGI is terrible (like a PS3 characther). Also, in some scenes the CGI is bad. But overall the movie is great and IMO is better than Avenger 2012 (whoch is a good movie too). My score is 8/10.",1
122,"Not the best story but it's a comic book movie, you expect that. It's funny and has a good pace. The cgi could be better. Overall, it's enjoyable to watch.",1
123,"Justice league finally has the DC universe going In the right direction. Superman was closer to the classic film versions in this movie. Batman was not as dark and brooding as BVS. The rest of the league had great scenes and each given their own time to shine. The first half was more origin and team building scenes but the second half really was a pleasure to see the league mesh well and fight as a team. Superman was as powerful as he should have been portrayed in earlier films, was confident and had a great dynamic within the team. Flash and Aquaman were interesting and both had funny scenes. Between the slow down effects of the Flash and brute strength of Aquaman, They were amazing in action sequences and broke up what could have easily been basic superhero fight scenes. Coming from a life long comic book and any thing superhero related fan. GO WATCH IT!!!",1

128,"Worthless Bullcrap/Dumb Confusion. The only things WB/DC are good at doing when it comes to this cinematic universe. May as well have said ""Directed by Uwe Boll"" in the opening credits.As for the perfect 10 scores. Your reviews are bad, and you should feel bad :p",0
129,"'Justice League' is one of the better DCEU films to be released, it is action-packed, exciting, fast-paced and fun. Ever since the death of Superman, the world has been wondering how they can cope without their ""god like"" hero. Batman (another solid performance from Ben Affleck) tries to get a team together when he uses his sources to find them, and have them join to defeat evil and protect the world. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is game for this as it is revealed that the evil they must face is Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), a ""god-like"" enemy who will unleash ultimate power, and can be hard to defeat. It doesn't take long for Barry Allen/""The Flash"" (Ezra Miller) to enthusiastically join, but Arthur Curry/""Aquaman"" (Jason Momoa) and Victor Stone/""Cyborg"" (Ray Fisher) have other plans, or is lacking motivation because of what they have become. The movie does a good job at being a fun superhero adventure, without skimping on the deep moments to develop our characters. What stops it from being amazing is its short run-time. It was rumored that this film was supposed to be 2h 40m long, but was stripped down to just 2 hours. There are aspects of this movie which felt rushed, and some things do get glossed over to the point where I felt some discussions could have been easily brought up, but were probably left on the cutting room floor, amidst all the reshoots and editing complications. 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (2016) I felt had an unfocused narrative and unclear character motivations, though, the dark and grim tone worked for that story. This movie corrects what last year's ""BvS"" did wrong. Every character here is used to their very best, and certain big reveals are definitely very surprising and worth the wait. This is definitely as good as any other superhero ensemble movie, the chemistry between our heroes is developed somewhat well (as I mentioned it was - at times - rushed), and how they team up to use their powers against their enemy ended up being a solidly entertaining third act. Overall, this is the DCEU stepping in the right direction, after 'Wonder Woman' (2017) and now this, it seems that the DCEU filmmakers have finally found a formula that is working. Keep it simple, add some levity when needed, showcase the characters teaming up well, and don't rely too much on referencing past DC films, or foreshadow upcoming ones. Keep these films standing on their own. This is another good comic book movie we've had in 2017.",1
130,"esto es como un reinicio al universo DC, la película la encontré correcta, ni idea los críticos, solo me hace pensar que ya no haré mas caso a los críticos para ver la próxima película.",1
131,"Trata-se de um ótimo filme do gênero ""super-heróis"". Fluido, ágil, divertido e impactante. Não é memorável como Batman V Superman, porém, está no nível dos aclamados filmes de heróis que se tem produzido ultimamente",1
132,"Let me be brutally honest. There are no redeeming qualities about this movie. The plot is a large ball of string that has been tangled beyond recognition and the characters offer absolutely NO emotional investment.The movie jumps from scene to scene with no real flow AND no clear direction. Halfway through the movie I genuinely wondered how I got here and why the movie is halfway done when it feels like it's been 5 minutes of ""story"".I truthfully cannot understand how people can be rating this 9 and 10 stars. WB do not make good DC movies. I understand it's frustrating but pretending it's a good movie is hurting your chances of ever actually making them good in the future. Telling a lie enough times might make you believe it but still does not make it true. WB have no incentive to make good movies and it is very sad. The whole thing stinks of a cash grab. Do not waste your time with this garbage",0
134,"Not the greatest superhero movie I've seen, but a lot more deserving than what professional critics are giving it. I'm noticing that the tastes of the people more and more are becoming the opposite of ""professionals"".",1
135,"I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. It has the same format as the first Avengers movie. An impending threat, some recruitment, some banter, and some CGI mayhem. It checks off every box, and entertains the hell out of you. Superman's badass. Flash's fast, and funny. Cyborg's mysterious. Aquaman's energetic. Wonder Woman, well, of course, she's wonder woman. Oh, and Alfred's funny too. Personally, I was surprised by the number of jokes in the movie. I thought they had exhausted them in the trailers - Boy, was i wrong! The theatre laughed so much! And, Superman scenes, the Amazonian battle, the JL - parademon battle too were all fantastic. Barry's running scenes were phenomenal!I have absolutely no idea why this movie has a 37 on RT or 46 on Metacritic. Personally, I felt this could've been even better if had a longer run time. 15 mins or so, just for the scenes to breathe. Nonetheless, it's pretty darn entertaining. Worth the wait !!",1
136,Everything I wanted to see in a Justice League movie was in here. My checks were hurting from all the smiling. Justice League gets me so excited for the future of the DCEU. Loved it!,1
137,"Recien termine de verla, y la disfrute mucho, se apresuraron en juntar al equipo, pero la ejecucion fue buena a mi parecer. Excelente, espero con ansias lo que viene para DC",1
138,Whilst the plot is nothing special the movie itself is fun and enjoyable in no small part to the actors portrayal of their characters and the interactions amongst the team. The movie delivers the versions of the iconic heroes fans have longed for and sets up what looks to be a very exciting future for the DCEU.,1
139,"Its the same old story when it come to films. Critics demolish a film and people who are interested to watch it don't and end up watching it illegally then realizing it was amazing. I experienced this when great reviews came out for guardians of the galaxy 2, I went to watch it and hated it. I enjoyed this film personally but don't take my word for it go watch it for your self. The movie brings together what we all hoped for, a team. its fun, bright and energetic with a balance of seriousness.A piece of advice don't go into this movie expecting to watch a movie on the level of the dark knight. In my opinion the only film to ever get close to that was the dark knight rises. As for the DC cinematic universe expect an array of bright movies the next possible dark movie you'll get is probably THE BATMAN.",1
140,"Disclaimer: I'm not going to say any plot in case someone wants to go in blind even though I think that's where all it's faults are. What. A. Mess. It was just as poorly written and disjointed as Suicide Squad but lacked the element of fun. You know those dresses at the Grammy's that are flashy cocktail dress that clearly were expensive but it just looks cheap and tacky? That was Justice League. Good Characters:  Wonder Woman: Wonder Woman is the strongest superhero movie of the year and she definitely was a plus in the movie. That being said there were some things that I thought went against the character we met in her movie. UPDATE: I just watched a video on all of the creepy things Whedon added to the movie about Gal Gadot. I missed some of them. I saw some of them. My score was originally 3/10 but now being reminded of all the objectifying. I had to mark it further down. I am sorry for Wonder Woman and I do remember wondering why the Flash was laughing because I guess I missed that split second. Gross. Aquaman: I can not believe I liked Aquaman. I can not believe I am admitting to liking Aquaman. But, the Atlantis scenes were stunning and I genuinely thought his hair added an eye catching look. I will say I preferred but his tatooed self and his suede jacket self to his aquaman outfit which I thought was too snug and poor costuming compared to the gorgeous costumes the other Atlantis people wore. Bad CharactersBatman: Have we seen too many Batman movies? Am I bored of it? I sure think Ben Affleck is and I'm sure he's trying to get out of his contract. He had chances and dialogue to make an impacting performance but I don't think he committed to the drama and high stakes.  Cyborg: Ehh. Out of the bad characters, he's probably my favorite. I don't know. Sometimes the CGI worked and sometimes it didn't. We didn't have enough of him for me to care what happened to him.Steppenwolf: I'm sorry but his name is Steppenwolf. That just sounds stupid. The name ""mother boxes"" is stupid. Mothmen are not scary but stupid. Stupid. THE FLASH: I feel like this movie could've been way more cohesive without Miller's character. Yes, I am a fan of Gustin's protrayal and didn't think I would like Miller, but I was going to give him a chance. Instead, he seemed to young and inexperienced to be hanging with Wonder Woman and Batman. He had one funny joke but the rest of them were randomly out of place and very very forced.",0
141,"Es buena película merece la pena verla, creo que cometieron errores pero frente al producto final no son nada se puede decir que la película paga la boleta superman se lleva el show por fin muestran todos los poderes y ya no es tan oscuro o buscan algo moralista ahí acción en varias partes y el villano cumple un mensajero de algo mas grande que no queda muy claro creo que ya están aprendiendo que van a hacer con su universo, y ya no es tan oscura y mala como las anteriores",1
142,"I went to the midnight showing and I'm going to be completly honest with this review. The plot and narrative have issues more to do with the condensed nature of the movie, however here's the thing there are some of the most amazing battle and comic book moments ever seen on the big screen. The opening is solid with Wonder Woman being so heroic and just beautiful, the back stories of Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg are well executed given their limited time and then about a third of the way through the movie and pace becomes electric with four absolutely stunning comic book action scenes rolled off one after the other. First the Amazons battle Stepenwolf to save their Mother Box which is flawless, beautifully shot and movie perfection, then Wonder Woman tells the story of the history lesson, which shows subtle little things like the Old Gods being 9 to 10 feet tall, ancient Mythology fighting an Alien threat, An Alien GL being killed by Stepenwolf, now Ancient Greek Gods fighting Aliens, that's never been done on screen before!   The third great action scene involves the team coming together and bonding in Gotham Sewer to stop the  parrademons from taking the Third Motherbox from the Starlab Scientists! The stakes increase as Stepenwolf kills one after another for not revealing it's location and a very reak World danger threat level looms! Finally we then get the highlight of the Movie Superman's resurrection and the sheer uncertainty of what state his mind is in! This was the part of the film that I most worried about  with fear of  yet more dark sinister Superman on the big screen, but it was handled brilliantly from Aquaman and Wonderwoman getting their arses kicked To Flash and Cyborg's uncertainity and where for a split second the  stakes in the film are raised to an even higher threat level, not knowing if reborn Superman is good or evil but Bruce being Batman always has a contingency plan!    So here we go, I loved Cyborg, liked Ezra Miller's Flash but not his running style! I loved Aquaman and wish we had more of the beautiful under water scenes, Mera was interresting and Wonder Woman was as always perfect. Ben Afleck was brilliant again and a very different Batman from BVS but star performance has to go to Henry Cavil's true portrayal of Superman, it was perfect and worth the admission on its own. The last final battle scene is not as good as the earlier ones but it doesn't matter because the connection and the interaction between the 6 founding members of DCEU's Justice league is so good that you forget that the villain is poor and simply not equipped to deal with Aquaman and Wonderwoman let alone the whole league including Superman.The ending is beautiful and nuanced if a little corny but who the **** cares, it's the Justice League. The two aftercredits are great and for all those people giving it under 6 or a 10, you have not seen the movie. I want to give this film 8.5 out if 10 but you can't so it get's 9 because of some truly memorable scenes in Comic book film history!",1
143,This year super hero movies from best to worst...1. Logan. 2. Justice League 3. Guardians of Galaxy 4. Wonder woman5. Thor 3 Ragnarok.One thing i din t like in movie was at the begining that muslim propaganda when cops arrest  guy.,1
144,"The critics are being way too harsh on this film. This film opens the door to so many possibilities for the DCEU. The end credits alone are worth the price of admission. It was awesome seeing Superman be Superman again and Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman were something special.",1
145,46% rating from critics  ? seriously. this movie is supposed to be enjoyable to watch and it does accomplish that hands down. Actor playing Flash is really good. Don't listen to the critics. Just go and watch it. you will enjoy it !,1
146,Yet again the critics get it wrong. It is a good movie with a coherent story and a great cast all the characters are portrayed well and there are enough tidbits to give some backstory to the members with no standalone movie. There are some noticeable distractions (some CGI upper lips if you have been following the development of the movie) but they do not take away from the experience.,1

148,"this movie is fun to watch. looks like a snyder movie but Indeed its not all the snyder's work i guess this movie would be better if this movie was directed by one director. Joss bring back all the cheesy jokes which doesn't quit work at all some of the jokes were his previous recycled work from Age of Ultron. the first half the chemistry of all the heroes WORK. i the 2nd half of the movie there is Bad CGI and a weak villain not only weak Wolfie is a Bad villain.superman's mustache CGI was bad his upper lip was weird.all his scenes are the part of Re-shoots. story is simple fast paced but characters are great the recruitment part is very fun to watch. characters are having fun on screen with mutual clashes of personalities and perspectives . Batman recruits the team still weakest charecter for me. Cyborg is badass, Woner women is was not great as in WW movie or BvS,Flash steals the show most of his jokes work some didn't, Aquaman has less screen time but still leave the impact and at last SUPERMAN is what you want to see for a long time",1
149,"I've never seen such a divide between fan vs critic reviews. this movie was awesome. it becomes more apparent to me that paid agitators exist in the movie business just as they do in politics. Hypocrisy ensues as the very things that critics blasted BvS for not doing, now they blast JL for course correcting. Pick a lane, guys. You keep changing your mind on what you want to complain about. I loved how these characters were portrayed. I loved the chemistry. I loved the music. the villain was not as much of a threat as he should have been. He wasn't as great of a challenge for the team. But I think that element is being saved for another movie. This was about uniting the team and the Superman we have been waiting for to arrive, and he did! Challenging the team comes later. This movie restored my faith in the DC universe even more after Wonder Woman. I would have loved for this movie to have been even longer, honestly. The parts of the trailer that were cut I wish would have all stayed. I think, just as with BvS, the Directors cut will be even better. And I am REALLY excited about Flash, and Aquaman solo movies. Bottom line, stay off the review sites about this movie. Trust the fans. We loved it.",1
150,"Justice League reminds me of the classic cartoon, Justice League Unlimited. The film feels like a 2 hour episode of the Bruce Timm animated show. The film isn't perfect, but it is very enjoyable.",1
151,"La pelicula funciona bien, buenos actores, una historia interesante con excelentes escenas de accion, solo un par de detalleges con el CGI del villano. Parece que ya es moda exigirle mucho a DC y no exigirle nada a Marvel.",1
152,"The movie could benefit from more time to better develop the villain and has some CGI problems, but overall it's solid and does a good job in your first contacts with some of these characters wile redeeming others. Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman are the soul of the movie, and while a little underwhelming for the long awaited Justice League introduction, it's guaranteed fun.",1
153,"Yes, it's true, this movie has problems, and yes, it's also true, that Justice League is a lot of fun! I enthusiastically recommend this movie, as it is very entertaining, with it's humor and the spot on depiction of the classic characters. Yes, this movie more than likely could have benefited from a longer run time, yes, the CGI is lacking in some places, yet despite those flaws, it does not drag down the overall enjoyable and fun experience of watching a demigod, an alien and man dressed as a bat get together to save the world from an alien threat. If you are familiar with the DC mythos, and or are a fan of the animated Justice League series, then you will love this movie, oh yes, yes you will!",1
154,"Much more enjoyable than expected! I’m forgiving of a cookie cutter villain & straightforward storyline considering how perfectly the actors fit their respective roles with the expansion of the DCEU, teasing some intergalactic goodness and a fully-realized Superman.",1
155,"What movie did the critics watch? This movie was great. I didn't even mind some of the bad CGI. Really good balance of action and dialogue. Not too much is revealed about the character origins, but at the same time lots of easter eggs if your a reader of DC material.",1
156,"Definitely not as bad as critics are saying. It’s not perfect and a bit of a mess, but the group chemistry is great, it’s funny but not goofy. I wish it was more epic with a better villain but overall was really happy to see those iconic heroes together.",1
157,"it was a comic book, like comic book movies should be.better than most marvel movies.i seriously don't understand why critics are so mean towards dc, Justice league was great, fast paced, action filled, and gorgeous looking.i enjoyed every minute of it, and came out of the cinema completely stunned by it. looking forward to watch it again.",1
158,This is a horrific development for the DC Franchise. Batman was never that ridiculous since Batman & Robin. Please don't go see it. The jokes fall flat and there are so many gigantic plot holes to get a jet carrier through. The CGI is terrible and the movie has this cheap outlook which is mind boggling and common for a direct to DVD production but not for a movie with a production budget of 300 million. I can't give it a low enough score. 10 of 10 puking **** for this stupidity of a movie.,0
159,"Amazing ! A nice, exciting film with a very good synergy between the characters.At least for me it was a very exciting and funny time.I wanted to see more. The film is a bit short to present more fully some characters.",1
160,"After the ''Wonder''ous surprise (God,i hate doing puns) that was Wonder Woman,Zack Snyder is back at the director's chair (almost...) with Justice League,a movie so messy and flawed,you could surprisingly find some enjoyment on it. But anyways,i expected it,it's a WB movie,so....Let's start with the good news. No matter what movie is he going to be in,Ben Affleck will always shine as Batman,same with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and Ezra Miller as The Flash (who kind of feels like the ''Spider-Man'' of the DCEU,because of its comedic timing). I was also surprised to see that there wasn't that much Zack Snyder-ization on it,with the color scheme and palette being sometimes bright (like the Wonder Woman movie) and the story being tonally in balance between lighthearted and dark,with scenes where you can tell that some of them are Snyder and others are Joss Whedon (since Whedon did $150 Million of reshoots). And did anyone miss Danny Elfman on the scoring stage? He did a great job on mixing the new generation and the 70s/80s with the soundtrack (when you'll hear some cues of the Batman (1979) and Superman ('89) theme,tears will be assured for sure!). Then there's the bad news...Oh my...The CG in this movie is almost everywhere,where in some parts i was okay with it,but in others i was constantly noticing it (the entirety of Cyborg,when Aquaman flows under the sea,SUPERMAN HAVNG A MOUSTACHE IN SOME PARTS.). The Flash's introduction was too fast and i didn't feel for Cyborg as a charachter. Oh,let's complain about Steppenwolf too. He's as forgettable as your school lessons,and the CG on him was obnoxious. The editing may feel choppy in some parts (that i can't tell because spoilers),so,i warned you. Overall,aside from the glaring flaw of Steppenwolf,it was nice to sit through Justice League. Trust me,with the action scenes and the story,you'll definetly forget Suicide Squad existed,and i'll be curious to see an Ultimate Cut of the movie (if they'll do it,since this movie was supposed to be 2h 45m longer).",1
162,"I don’t understand why critics hate this movie so much, I’m not saying it is perfect, but it is definitely not a 46/100, it’s so much better than BvS in every way .",1
165,"This film was my childhood dream come true!!! Every character had a moment to shine: The Flash was hilarious, Aquaman was a straight up G, Cyborg was THE vital piece in the team, Wonder Woman was the glue that held the league together, Batman was the brains of the operation, but Superman was hands down the BEST part of the film for me; his return is EPIC!!! If you're an avid DC Comics reader, such as myself, you will notice a lot of really cool Easter eggs in this film and whatever you do, do NOT leave until ALL of the credits are done; 2 of the best post credit scenes I've seen in a comic book movie. The 1st one was really funny and nods to something that happens in the comics but the 2nd one is truly an AMAZING one that sets up the future of the DCEU in a really cool way.",1
166,"If I had listened to haters, ""professional"" critics, and various whiny geese, I wouldn't have gone to see Justice League. I didn't listen, so I did go. The movie is practically flawless from plot and characterization, to action and special effects. It felt like Justice League with a huge range of emotion for the viewer. Intense excitement, seriousness, dark where it should be dark, light and humorous where it should be light and humorous. I don't feel the need to nitpick because there is something called gratuitous nitpicking and I refuse to do that. The ending was beautiful, poignant and promising of even greater things to come. Like other reviewers I don't know which movie those who bash it saw, but it must have been a different Justice League.",1
167,"Movie is awesome. It does have some issues, but nothing bigger than any other superhero movie. Certainly not bigger issues than any Avergers movie. Cast is awesome, and the movie is genuinely fun. Critics seem were expecting a different movie, but make no mistake, this is pure comic book awesomeness in the big screen. Worse issue by far is the poor CGI related to Cavill moustache removal (no joke). Seems the postprod team had a very short timespan to get it done after last minute reshoots, and the result is less than satisfactory, but if you can put that issue aside, movie feels epic and certainly more ""friendly"" and enjoyable than the darker and almost depressing BvS. Please, don't rely on critics reviews for watching JL. If you need an informed opinion ask a friend you trust who had seen it, or take my advice and go to the cinema without wasting any single more second. If you like the superhero genre you will enjoy it. And even if superheroes are not your cup of tea, you may be surprised after the two hour running time (again, that is if you can ""forgive"" the crappy FX moustache removal job :) )",1
168,"It was actually a dream come true for me. I am a huge DC fan. Though the movie was not perfect, I enjoyed it. It's not an unwatchable movie. I think everyone will enjoy the movie. I watched it two times.",1

172,I was totally disapointed. Only one thing to say... The character development is awful.,0
174,"This is by far the best DC movie of the post Christian Bale Batman era. I realise that’s not giving a lot in the way of praise, as the previous movies haven’t set the bar very high.Why so much better? For a start, the two hour running time whizzed by, to the point where I was left wanting more. How many people said that after Batman vs Superman or Suicide Squad? The new editions of The Flash and Cyborg breathed life into the proceedings, and were a welcome counter point to the stuffy old Batman and Wonder Woman characters. But most of all it was good because it didn’t feature too much of Henry Cavill’s perma-frown version of Superman.The story was neither here nor there, and just acted as a vehicle for lots of fighting and running around. I can see that the colour-by-numbers baddie (Steppenwolf – not the same person as penned the immortal rock tune Born to be Wild) has copped a lot of flak. He wasn’t particularly bad, daft yes, awful no. And his CGI was adequate.One slight problem, the story left nothing that needed continuing. I guess there’ll be a Justice League II, but why? Unlike Avengers movies (this lots main rival), I didn’t see the beginning of a multi film story arc. Well, that’s not entirely true. I was left with one question – Aquaman, why? He brought nothing to the film and quite frankly looked very silly (and this is a genre where silly is the norm).If there is a JL II would I watch it? Yes, definitely. Especially if Superman dies again and this time they promise not to bring him back.",1
178,"Remember back in the late 90's/early 2000's when super hero movies were a bit rubbish? We're back there aren't we? Justice league is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Predictable, patronizing, and forgettable.  I wish they had taken more time with this series of movies, rather than rush them out as to compete with Marvel. If it had stuck a little closer to its source material, and taken its time in building its universe, perhaps there may have been a chance for it. DC fans will see through its flaws no doubt, but the average movie goer will not enjoy this.",0
179,"Justice League is a fun superhero movie that takes the DC universe in the right direction. The cinematography is great and Flash/Cyborg bring a fresh new feel to the team. It's disappointing to see so many reviewers piling on the hate even as WB is righting the ship with Wonder Woman and Justice League. Aquaman and (spoilers) Superman both feel a bit superfluous, and the tone is a bit disjointed between the Snyder and Whedon segments, but the end result is a solid superhero entry.",1
180,"Justice League is yet another Super Hero blockbuster snooze fest like every other dull over done super hero movie in a long line of factory produced movies. Designed for the modern comic book movie goer (not actual comic readers pre 2000) Justice League is the onscreen equivalent of a circle jerk. It's comic porn, throw in as many Hero's as possible to get the fake comic geeks all excited, toss in a lame story to hold the sex scenes (action scenes) together and there you have it, another super hero porno for the easily amused. The film is bland and unimaginative. It make's the awful Avengers look like Citizen Kane. All the characters are wetbags that appeal to modern social justice warriors. The days of the golden comic book era are long gone replaced with caricatures terrified of offending anyone or stepping outside the familiar, formulaic box. Justice League is a film for the stupid, the fashionable who will watch so they can act like they are all geek sheek and let all their friends know on social media. It's a film used as a fashion accessory to those who need to fit in with the nerd crowd while buying Pop vinyls and nerd boxes to display characters they've only ever seen on the big screen or read about in the new age comics that no real self respecting comic fan reads anymore.  While the cool kids moved onto reading Neil Gaiman and Alan Moore the new age fashion fakes push the market with comics that were disregarded once you hit 15. And each year Hollywood continues to quickly mass produce more super hero porn for them to consume while the actual film lovers are neglected because no decent films ever seem to be made anymore.",0
183,"Justice League is not a terrible movie in my opinion. If you enjoy and understand the comics you’ll like it. Could they have done things a little better? Sure, but also remember ladies and gentlemen this was not the movie Zack Snyder envisioned.  The CGI could have been better and the plot could use a little work. Curious how much Joss Whedon changed in the reshoots? I enjoyed it and hope they continue to build the DCEU.",1
186,"So basically what they did after Snyder's deprature was cutting the original coherent vision and translating it into a PG-7 popcorn firework display, during which you will be pleased with the eyecandy special effects, but also face-palm numerous times at the general stupidity of the dialogues and the non-existent plot. Gone are the political struggles, moral dillemas and anything that a grown-up (i.e. anyone over 14) would consider at least slightly interesting. At this point, the cinematic DC is just a pathetic MCU wannabe.",0
187,"Aburrida, predecible, lineal, sobrevalorado, tratan de copiar y de innovar y el resultado es una perdida de tiempo, la peor película que vi en el año. Algo bueno? Efectos especiales",0
189,"Dissapointing is one defining word for latest installation of the DCEU. It's no wonder it's failing at the box office. The confusing and poor script remove any sense of simplicity from the story, and it feels as if nothing is linking the scenes together- the editing is awful. Even films like the phantom menace have that aspect of film making sorted. However, on the other hand, the performances from the actors are all quite good and the action and interesting characters make it seem as if there might have been a good movie in here. A sentence to sum up this movie: Even good performances from the cast can't save this poor, confusing and unsimplistic movie.",0
190,"What everyone knows already: The CGI is indeed off (yes, that upper lip is as bad as they say), the story disjointed, and the style differs wildly in places. It seems that WB, in a bizarre loss of reason, decided that the best way to shoot a DC movie is to have the film made, then chopped up, reorganized, chopped up some more, reorganized again, rinse and repeat until you get a product that appears to still need a significant amount of polishing done. There's this knee-jerk approach they've seemingly adopted, and the movies are all the worse for it.Why are Marvel movies so successful? Because it's driven by the same people who have a hand in the comics. DC's movies though? Those are run by people I suspect that do not have a hand in neither the movies nor the comics, Geoff Johns notwithstanding.The main issue I think is that WB saw Marvel's success and decided that they're going to half-ass copy Marvel's approach and make big team-up superhero movies as quickly as they can, only they had none of Marvel's careful planning in any meaningful way.Is it any wonder that Ben Affleck is done with the DCEU? This is the norm for WB DC movies, and it won't change as long as WB has control over it. Sadly that disinterest shines through in some of the actors' performances as well, especially so for this version of Batman.It's bad. Not just this movie (there are good bits in as well here and there, to be completely fair), but the whole current state of the DCEU. It's just bad.",0
191,"Unwatchable. Ugly visuals, stupid story, ridiculous villain, no pace, no stakes. What a mess.",0
193,"This is a pretty unbearable film. The visuals and sound design are possibly the worst I have been subjected to all year. The dialogue is ham fisted. Even the action sequences are sub-par. Worst of all is the way Wonder Woman is objectified by the camera; the is the worst case of the male gaze ruining a film in a long time. There are some shining moments, but not nearly enough to justify the rest of this terrible film.",0
199,"Loved the actors and their characters, but the superman mustache treatment was really weird looking. Wished the movie was longer without all the editing cuts which hurt my score overall. Can't wait to see the director's cut.",1
200,"Is a good movie, fun and functional. The characters are good and interesting, and have a good dynamics between them. The story of the film is very generic, but does not disturb the film. The point that ends up leaving the movie ""bad"" (being that it is not) is the villain, who is very bad. The CGI is also not there, but not bad.",1
202,"This movie is a mess. First of all the plot is incredibly boring in that it has a villain without real motives that are explained, they just are. He is looking for three boxes that are just the tools of the universe basically but like why? We are never really given a clear explanation for this and we just roll with it. Next is the characters, Cyborg is the most boring thing ever. He acts extremely edgy and emotional throughout the whole film and never takes a moment to exercise real human emotions. Flash is actually quite good but only acts as the comedy of the movie, I think the future he could have some real solid moments for him. Aqua Man is far from lame, the dude is a straight up badass but its more of an implied thing. The movie needs more moments with him doing something really cool, like more than just swimming and using water, we know he can do that already. Wonder Woman is probably the best part of this movie, she feels just like a hero should and really kicks ass. There are few problems with her besides some tone moments that mostly come from cut content in the film. Batman was actually pretty good here, he dropped much of his brooding personality from the last movie and acts more like a less memorable version of Christopher Nolan's Batman (which isn't perfect but its getting better). Superman was straight up weird, first of all its stupid that they killed him off before because its better to kill someone and let them stay dead (more emotional impact) especially if they had a real history in the series. He ended up making the plot too easy to finish. Also this movie managed to look really bad, like I could always tell when something was fake or CGI. The budget needs to be used more for practical looking fight scenes between equally matched characters and a lot less computer made enemies being thrown around. Down scale and make these movies watchable please",0
207,"I couldn't stop yelling at the screen. If they wanted a funny Flash, they should have went with Wally West. Despite recent changes in the comic, Cyborg is not a Justice League tier hero. When in the history of comics has Batman been vulnerable or asked for advice from the rest of the team? Why does everyone know every one else's identity's right from the get go?And Aquaman joining was a lot too easy.The only redeeming factor of the movie was Wonder Woman, and Gal Gadot did a really great job expressing the character.And since when is Barry Allen jewish?They spent a lot of time explaining the backgrounds of all these characters (poorly) with little explanation of what is going on with this Steppenwolf; who has all about the same amount of backstory shown as badly rated Thor 2 baddy MalekithGive us what we want.Which is the Justice League (that is, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, and Green Lantern) in uniform the whole time, kicking butt. All of these characters are meant to be ""perfect"". They have more of ""vices"" than imperfections... and those are the things you need to explore. Batman will never accept help... and they chose to make him be the one constantly asking for help. Justice League Doom (Tower of Babel) awesome story; and they basically subverted it. Superman's weakness is he fears his power... so they kill him. Wonder Woman will never give up... they don't explore that at all. Flash... well.. depends which Flash. That wasn't Barry Allen, but Barry Allen's fault was that he had to slow down. He pushed his limits too far for his own safety. Aquaman's fault is that he doesn't give a damn about the rest of Earth (and his pride) and we saw very little of that here.Instead, focus on your bad guys, which should include the whole gamut of baddies. There's so many to choose from and they can all team up. Injustice League, or Justice Lords, or make up a new mixup. Lets see Gorilla Grodd or Captain Cold, teaming up with Lex or Joker or Metallo or Braniac. Lets see Cheetah. Lets see Sinestro. Having just Steppenwolf was a terrible decision. Do they think they're saving the others for later, or do they plan to just build up to Darkseid and nothing else?With the exception of the Wonder Woman film, and Wonder Woman in Justice League, the DCEU has done just about everything wrong, and there's not a single thing shown in Justice League (and their slated movies to come.. though, maybe I'll hold out for Shazaam, but Zach Levi? Really? and no more Dwayne Johnson? Really?) to make us think that will change any time soon.",0
208,"Justice League was a movie with potential, filled with hype all 'round. Sadly it just didn't live up to this expectation. At first glance, the movie looks nice and it was expected to have a solid plot, but under no circumstances was this film good. As a fan of DC movies of the 21st century this film really puts it away for me. We expected after wonder woman that this would be more thrilling and connect the movies together. The only thing this movie did was take it apart, and hear are some reasons why.1. Horrible CGI: Seriously, have you seen Steppenwolf's face? Not to mention the last minute details that cost 25 million dollars to 'remove' Henry Cavil's mustache.2. Stale plot: This film could not get worse in terms of it's pacing. It goes from one scene to the other in a matter of moments, without laying a proper carpet down for entry.3. Useless spectacles: You'd expect this film to have some fight scenes that are worthy of sitting down with some popcorn and having your mind blown. Nope. I have more, but I'd rather not take an extra large crap on this and try to focus on the positives of this film.1. The Jokes: Now the jokes aren't exactly funny, but considering that you're staying in a 2 hour long movie with nothing to amaze you, you WILL be trying your best to laugh at the jokes as much as possible.Now if this review is lower than your expectations, it may have also been to do with the  person that was sitting next to me whispering ""oooooHhhh It's FLASH"" and ""Aquaman is such a badass""In conclusion, this movie is worth seeing if your a die hard DC fan but casual cinema goers beware. Unless you just watch it brain-dead to get rid of some stress. Anyways,Have a good one.",0
209,"I was really happy with the movie. I had absolutely no idea what critics hated about this. The studio had actually addressed some of the feedback from previous movies. They made it lighter, the story was not complex and more coherent, Superman iteration was one of the best, Flash and Aquaman want leave you longing for more. What more do you want from the 4th movie in DCEU. I recommend people to go check it out.",1
210,"The story and action scenes are ridiculous and the acting subpar. The movie feels like a budget version of the Avengers, without any proper character buildup or humor.",0
212,"Me sorprende la cantidad de malas criticas que ha tenido esta película, si es verdad que él villano es flojo y que él cgi en la cara de superman hace ruido en la vista pero como un todo JL es una película muy entretenida con buenas actuaciones y química entre sus personajes. Lo único que yo de verdad le critico es la banda sonora tan transparente y poco epica en determinados momentos contando con danny elfman cm uno de los principales autores.",1
213,"""Good"", ""Ok"" and ""A step in the right direction"" are not the terms you use when you're face to face with Rembrandt's masterpiece painting ""The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp"". Those terms are utterly an insult to a master artist of such caliber. You're more credible walking away saying ""Sorry, this looks good but as a person I prefer to go look at Davinci's work."" And that, dear reader, is what you will be left with exiting the theater. the utter satisfaction of experiencing great art. I'm not saying ""justice league"" is like a Rembrandt but there's no denying this is a great piece of modern visual literature standing next to V for Vendetta, Logan, the Batman Nolan trilogy, The Avengers (First one)..etc...but to discredit such an praiseworthy effort in the superhero genre will only be detrimental to the masses who appreciate it. I had a stupid grin on my face start to finish. A CRAZY STUPID COMIC BOOK JOKER LIKE SMILE. The ""English Patient"" may have QUESTIONABLY won critics praise and an Oscar but I guarantee you ""Justice League"" was made with passion and heart and it will DEFINITELY suck you into the DC Mythology right where You're going to want to live out the rest of your wonderful geeky comicbook fanboy life.",1
214,"Justice League is beyond amazing, the cast shines together, the characters are well served. Love the whole chemistry and the badass scenes are breathtaking. The only thing it bothers me is the boring villain and the movie should be longer. It's a great movie, very entertaining!",1
216,"Amazing movie!Fantastic action done by zack sanyder, characters identical to comics, and a comic villain.The visual effects are great and fear may even be the worst weakness of a wolf",1
217,"Great Movie!! I love it!! this is a perfect comic movie. The best: characters, their químic & the fight scenes. It's not a perfect movie but has the essence of super heroes.",1
218,An amazing movie! It was the Justice League movie I always wanted to see! I don't understand why the reviews are so slow. There was a scene or two with CGI issues but it did not effect the viewing of the movie. The post credit scenes were awesome!,1
219,"Justice League is probably the second most accessible movie in the DCEU, just being beat out by Wonder Women. The entire film is like a photo negative to Batman V Superman both tonally and visually. Brighter colors and characters where even batman gets some laughs. Definitely the most humor in a DC film by far. The characters are the best part of the film, they really seem to get all the characters right making this feel like more in line with the animated films than what has come before. This is a film that I believe more general audiences will like as it feels like DC is finally giving up the grim, complex and adult mindset and adopt a more Marvel feel. This is a movie that parents could take there kids to see and have a good time. That being said, this film is flawed. You can feel that there was more to this film that had to be cut as Warner Brothers mandated it to be no more than 2 hrs long to get more showtimes in per day. It never really slows down and thankfully I don't see people being bored at any point in the film.The villain is one note. Though I understand his motivations, it's more likely because the one or two lines explaining his motivations have more meaning if you know the comic book lore. Even though most people don't like/hate the other Snyder films they seemed to have more meat to them as far as deconstructing the genera. Justice League plays it safe delivering a fun intro to a host of new characters while coarse correcting others. Keeping my bias aside I would give this a 7.5/10. Also Stay through all of the credits for 2 post credit scenes.",1
220,"Фильм очень понравился. Критики что-то там говорили про бессвязный сюжет и т.д., но я ничего этого не увидел. Всё объясняется, всё понятно и логично. Единственное, что вызвало у меня вопросы, это то, откуда Супермен взял новый костюм. На мой взгляд, Лига лучший фильм ДС и лучший супергеройский фильм этого года. Не отрицаю, что злодею может уделили мало времени, но его цель и мотивы ясны. Члены Лиги были очень хороши и отлично взаимодействовали друг с другом. Киборг, пожалуй, как персонаж самый слабый из них, но общую картину это не портит. Он не хуже, чем, например, Соколиный Глаз в первых Мстителях. Аквамэн брутален и Джейсон Момоа отлично справился с ролью. Флеш — тот персонаж, который разбавляет всю обстановку и иногда смешит публику, и всё бы замечательно, но дубляж его абсолютно не понравился. Чудо-Женщина такая же, как и в остальных фильмах — тут и так всё хорошо. А вот Бэтмена чуть изменили: он не такой мрачный и отчаянный, как в БпС, и вот его образ в БпС мне нравился больше. Но он не обязан быть таким, ведь тут уже другие события, он не один и поэтому другие эмоции. Супермен невероятно крут, просто мощь. В одиночку Лигу раскидал, а из Степпенвульфа сделал грушу для битья. Кстати, наконец тут показали его способность, которую до этого в киновселенной не показывали — морозное дыхание. В целом, тут нет такой мрачности и атмосферы, как в БпС, но опять-таки, он и не обязан быть таким. Да, добавили много шуток, чтобы критики могли быть спокойными за это, ведь они почему-то считают, что в фильмах по комиксам обязательно должны быть смешные сцены, но несмотря на всё это, назвать Лигу комедией язык не повернётся. И вот многие говорят, мол, видно, что два режиссёра фильм делали, видно, что усы Кэвиллу замазывали, графика плохая... Типо серьёзные моменты делал Снайдер, а шутки — Уидон? Сомневаюсь, что кто-то заметил бы это, если бы никто не сказал, что некоторые моменты фильма переснимали. Про криво замазанные усы Кэвилла тоже чушь какая-то. Я специально вспомнил про это и всматривался — вроде всё там нормально, даже и не видно, что где-то там компьютерная графика. Опять-таки, если бы про это не говорили, никто бы внимания не обратил. А почему к графике прикопались, мне вообще непонятно. Некоторые сцены с трейлеров не попали фильм. Вероятно будет расширенная версия и я этому только рад. Хотя бы дополнительные 10-20 минут фильма будут очень кстати. В общем и целом, фильм отличный, поставил бы 8,5-9/10. Кто любит фильмы по комиксам — рекомендую.",1
221,"The movie is excellent, a great intro to the JL. The team rocks, specially WW.  It's an excellent set up for future solo movies as the the JL movie itself dedicates its time to the team.  The only negative is that a few superman scenes seemed rushed, the CGI wasn't polished enough, however, it didn't take anything away form the movie, awesome movie.",1
222,"This movie is absolutely terrible. It's boring, it takes way longer to get going than it does it to finish, and one hashtag: #headbuttingcontest. Wonder Woman feels purposely interjected into many, many sequences, and it feels old and tired. I think she fights Steppenwolf three times, and every single time the battle looks exactly the same. At one point I wondered if this was Wonder Woman 2. Also, it's kind of thrown in there that Batman wants Wonder Woman to lead the group (why??), and then later she says, ""On my lead"" with a smile on her face while like 1 or 2 people are there... Showing Wonder Woman that much has revealed maybe what everyone already knew -- Gal Gadot has no onscreen personality -- she's just eye-candy. Steppenwolf is a joke, the conclusion is a joke -- I never thought I'd say this, but the reviews were right. This movie is terrible. But go ahead and see it anyways (if you have to) to see for yourself. I probably would never sit down to watch this movie ever again (same for BvS) just because it's soooo boring. There are a few sequences that are very, very cool. I saw it in 3D, and the 3D was done very well. But overall, I feel so sad for DC. They're too afraid to step out and go with what makes this stuff awesome. Why can't they recognize what's good about their films and what's not?? I personally think that the compelling thing about DC could be it's more adult tone and emotional gravity to each of its characters. I won't just rant on this movie completely.... I'll just say this: they got Aquaman right. They were headed in the right direction with Batman (except he's old and tired in this movie just like how this movie actually feels). They might be on to something with the Flash, but he's also a little annoying. Cyborg was wayyyy too dang moody and upset the entire movie for his own good. I'm surprised he wasn't incorporated into the story more because he seems like he would have some cool powers (instead of the cliche ""let me just sit here and google search a bunch of stuff while you guys do something else""). And then Wonder Woman... well, you get a HEAVY dose of her. Imo there's just too much of her. There are a couple entrances that feel over-the-top cheesy, and she has one of them. The Flash is such a pansy that it doesn't even make sense. His biggest contribution is bouncing a sword off his fingertip. I mean, they seriously thought it would be a good use of money to make a scene like that?? Whoops, now I'm going back to ranting. But I had very small hopes for this movie to begin with and even those were dashed. Just be warned.",0
223,"went to see JL yesterday  with friends, I really enjoy it, it is a very good popcorn SH movie, enough fun, major characters are quite good it feels a lit bit short,flaws exists but no where near the level that some RT ""professional"" critics to condemn it ( as low as 1 point out of 5) my friends hardly notice the visual issue of Henry Cavill's upper lip . and of course we had a very good time, it is not as good as WW, but still a very decent work",1
225,"Justice League tries its hardest to be the superhero movie DC needs in its repertoire, however its not all the way there. The weakness lies not only in the very obvious reshoots, that seem very Joss Whedon (I'd prefer not to leak spoilers, but mostly involving intimate character moments) which change the tone of the film dramatically, but also in the fact that not all the characters seem fleshed out. Overall though it is a decent start to the League's adventures.",1
227,"Like catching malaria after you have survived ebola, Justice League has the DC Universe trending upward.It is a Frankenstein of a film, obviously a bigger film lurks behind but it has been stitched together by Joss Whedon in post production, so we get some lighter touches but I think we all know who shot the 6 scenes where the camera is trained on Gal Gadot's butt. In 2017. In Hollywood...in the same year that Patty Jenkin's directed the exact same goddamn protagonist...it is beyond imagining.Steppenwolf is the CGI villain. He is the worst superhero villain in a few decades. All the CGI is horrible. This film had a budget of 300 MILLION...The cast are not bad and I give them a break looking at the screenplay and direction. Ezra Miller is good as The Flash and Jason Momoa at least brings a different energy to the crew of heroes. The rest look like they are trying to survive a death march. The exception is Amy Adams, pay her everything to keep being Lois Lane.This is just insulting but like a 7 year old playing the flute, I have given one extra star for trying.",0
228,"i want to start with all the critics but i will not , the movie was great the first justice league movie is here and it delivers almost everyone's performance was stunning especially ezra miller. From first to last the movie was entertaining so much is there to be revealed and those credit scenes were epic, i will not say anything about all the movie critics but they are making things unfair for everyone, anyways a fun and absolute sharp movie loved it.",1
229,"Went to the theater with a good friend expecting nothing, or at least nothing special considering the critics slammed it to smithereens. After seeing it, I honestly cannot understand where all the hate is coming from. Sure, it ain't perfect, but definitely not worth the 43 that Metacritic is giving it.",1
230,"Wen into the movi with high expectations and I was still blown away. I love this movie for me at least is easily in my my top ten superheroe movies of al time. As far as cgi is concerned did not bother me at all. The villain was perfect for the film. I mean it's a movie about getting the Justic Leauge together so I was glad they did not focus on Steppenwolf so much I mean even in the comics this guy was not amazing. Also that introduced scene with that song was powerful, reminded me of the Watchmen intro. I understand the plot was not the greatest but once again it was about getting the JL together so it was a more character driven story. I plan on seeing it a second time and was not disappointed",1
231,"gives battlefront II a 76, but **** justice league gets a 45? sad. donald trump should become the president of whatever company reviewed this movie so he could fire some ****",1
232,"Justice League is a much needed change after BvS. The biggest change is the fantastic cast of characters. Every character is cast perfectly, with Ezra Miller standing out as the flash. The story was simple and fairly average with the villain being weak and uninteresting. However, this is often overshadowed by the cast and the chemistry between them. There is more comedy in the film and most of it lands. The CGI is great at times and passable at other times but it never takes you out of the film. When all was said and done, I walked out excited for what’s to come in the DECU.",1
233,"As usual, dont believe the critics. Go and see it for yourself. Its very worth it. I was never a fan of cyborg or Aquaman, but they did a good job making both appropriately bad-@$$. The comedy was solid, and the story was good. I'd like to see them add Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter and Shazam (the REAL Captain Marvel) later. As it is, Sups mops the floor with the Boss while the rest struggle with the pions. At least Wonder Woman holds her own and Aqua Man is a mix of bad@$$ and funny (just not as effective on land). While I hated when they cast Ben Affleck as Batman at first, I'm on board now. DC did good here.",1
234,"Besides the story line that is a little out of nothing, the movie is really good, there are amazing action moments and really tense moments, all characters have a great chemistry with each other without being funny or only using jokes, amazing movie by DC, totally will see it again (I hate DC but this one is great)",1
235,"Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat",0
236,"Excellent movie. The characters played out straight from the comic book, I really don't know what critics are smoking theses days. I watched it twice in 2 days and still enjoyed every single scene.",1
237,The Movie was great and fun to wactch. Action scenes were incredible. Batman was somehow weak in the movie but at the same time cool. Superman was amazing together with wonderwoman. Cyborg was good. Flash and aquaman was pretty good. The only thing maybe the thing is that it was somehow short and not enough. It was somehow bland because of the cuts,1
238,"As with every review, please take with a grain of salt. You are best going into any film with an open, independent, and clear mind. Now of course, that being said...A few critic's reviews that align with my thinking:https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/fun-justice-league-cleverly-assembles-a-superhuman-fight-club/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/justice-league-2017https://blackgirlnerds.com/justice-league-review/MY REVIEW:JUSTICE LEAGUE, which comes in hot on the trail of the universally-lauded WONDER WOMAN, is a fine, pop-culture superhero flick that, unfortunately, bears an unnecessarily large burden of expectation and judgement.To say the DCEU up to this point has been divisive is an understatement. Launching in 2013 with the Man of Steel, which I credit as one of the best comic book films of the past 15 - 20 years, things came crashing down with the darkly grim BvS: Dawn of Justice (2016), a film that polarized audiences more than any big budget film in recent memory. I appreciated its adult, operatic nature — a dizzying epic that touched deeply on themes of alienation, humanity, immigration, xenophobia, and fascism vs democracy.  That type of film, however, was just not something people were looking for in a superhero film featuring the first on-screen appearance of Batman and Superman together. I do think once time passes, the film we have, especially the true Ultimate Cut, will be appreciated and acknowledged for its daring and unique nature — a true mythological epic, not a disappointment to be derided for its dark tone and different characterization of well-established characters.Things turned around with WONDER WOMAN in 2017, with the critically-lauded origin story of Princess Diana aka Wonder Woman. A fantastic, equally progressive yet old-school superhero film, WW gave audiences around the world a glimmer of hope that the DCEU was finally on track after the disappointments of BvS and Suicide Squad (not mentioned above, but that film like BvS was rejected by critics, but somehow eked its way to nearly $800 million worldwide).Enter JUSTICE LEAGUE, which brings in years worth of reports of behind-the-scenes issues (some true, many not), skepticism due to the previous installments of the DCEU franchise, derision, comparison to Marvel, and the expectations from DC fans to live up to their personal visions (with decades of daydreaming, who can blame them?) — all weight that no film in recent memory has had to shoulder.While sometimes clunky, sometimes rushed, and a tad too narratively and thematically streamlined, JUSTICE LEAGUE is a fine, exhilarating, and deeply enjoyable flick hat lives up to the hype. It's an immersive, fun cinematic experience built on character, and all of the actors shine in their roles — Ben Affleck is solid as Batman, Gal Gadot continues to build towards icon-status with her performance as Wonder Woman, Henry Cavill IS Superman, and Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, and Ray Fisher all explode onto the screen as the newcomers to the DCEU universe. In particular, Jason Momoa and Ezra Miller both ooze with charisma, and one cannot help but feel excited for their solo flicks. Personally, I can't wait for Aquaman next year; James Wan is an incredible filmmaker, and cannot wait to see what he does in this world.Although choppy in the first 45 minutes (this is definitely where the bulk of the narrative was cut to make the 2-hour runtime), things kick into high gear with the first action sequence featuring the League together (although Aquaman arrives a tad late to the festivities). I was grinning from ear-to-ear, and this sequence is a major standout among films in 2017: funny, propulsive, tense, exciting, and exhilarating... everything you could want from a film featuring the Justice League. Will have to wait for a second watch, but it could eventually rank as one of the best action sequences in a superhero film. It certainly already ranks up there with Batman's warehouse seen in BvS in terms of recent standout DCEU sequences.From then on, JL moves forward at a breakneck pace, with jokes, quips, and action coming at you right until the final credits roll (and including during and after the credits, so stay in the theater). One thing I enjoyed was a Spielbergian mini-narrative (also recently done in Sicario) built around a Russian family, that adds dramatic heft to a scene during the third act that, had they not spent the time to build, would have been a throwaway.Running out of room here, but overall, JUSTICE LEAGUE is a fun, comic book film and experience that, although a tad lightweight, excels at characterization, adventure, and overall feel. I left the theater grinning, exhilarated, and feeling hopeful, and I hope you have the same experience as I!RATING: 7.7 / 10",1
239,"JL is admittedly going to be more difficult for non-DC fans. References to characters / lore aren't filled in and will no doubt prove confusing for some. Steppenwolf is not quite the 'blank page' villain (there are hints at a backstory and motivation perhaps left on the cutting room floor), but the fact that he exists only as a CG creator is a problem.That said - this feels more like a character course correction, one steeped in DC lore, for which I'm grateful. Superman feels like a mix between Reeves and Morrison. Batman's violence in BvS has consequences. Wonder Woman's forced to take on SM's mantle. And the new characters (Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg) each have space to breathe and establish themselves. All three could support a solo movie, although I suspect Aquaman and Flash moreso than Cyborg.The overuse of CG can be a problem. The main villain needs a physical presence next time. WB should have allowed a slightly longer edit. But many of Geoff Johns' creative instincts are present here, as is Whedon's humour and Snyder's style. It makes for a good blend.",1
240,"Justice League after the mixed opinions of the people by Batman v Superman and after Wonder woman was a success he had his doubts about a film where a team was formed without making individual films first, and I do not know if it is the fan inside ò the boy who lived with episodes and episodes of such a great animated series, but I just can not hate this movie, love every moment I saw, but with respect to this ensemble, the film is an amalgam between two creative minds, one visual and the other argumental, and it is noticeable when one began and the other ends, it is noticeable when the film falters and it is in the CGI, the visual effects are good at the moment, then as they fail and this is noticeable in his villain steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) because of moments see well other moments like no, Cyborg (Ray Fisher) also suddenly notice the very simple effects, regarding the plot is simpler and easier to digest something that many discussed from earlier I think it goes more in a straight line and that can help you not feel boring, on the contrary it is very entertaining and fun and having humor is not synonymous with bad jokes or comedy every five minutes, there is a balance in this however there are some holes that leave you in doubt if that was still missing or explain something and this is due to two factors the first is Warner not wanting to risk making a movie that lasts more than two hours and the second is that the change of director did not help at all with the final edition, even with these flaws there is something that makes one of those mistakes forget and is what we come to see the league of justice, the chemistry between the actors is amazing it is seen as a fairly united family that get along well you want and want to see more of them in action everyone makes their excellent role Ben affleck is Batman, Gal Gadot is still the amazing Wonder Woman, Ezra miller is an excellent Flash you just can not not love him, Jason Momoa takes over a rude Aquaman and dive As you feel like watching your individual movie, Ray Fisher as Cyborg maybe the weakest link but still the plot works for him and Henry Cavill as Superman is the hero that everyone expected him to be is the boyscout that fans asked for, the band sound of Danny Elfman is very much in line with the situations, nothing memorable (except for his batman theme and the classic theme of superman) but still very present in the scenes, without a doubt this movie I loved, I would see the times they were because it has the essence of heroism that was needed that fun and charm that had the animated series, the animated movies, an era of heroes is coming and this was the prologue of better moments.",1
241,"Acredito que a liga da justiça foi mais pra mostrar o que estar por vir no universo da DC. A verdadeira liga da justiça ainda vai chegar, isso ai pra mim foi mais um aperitivo. Enfim, o universo da DC esta dando seus primeiros passos ainda, tenham paciencia. Mas afinal, o filme é bom? Logico que é, ainda mais com a volta do superman, Ben Affleck esta fazendo historia como o Batman. Ben affleck é o Batman que todos queriam ver, calculista, espiao, e porradeiro.",1
242,"This is the kind of movie where you should listen to the fans' reviews, and not the critics. Justice League is far from being a perfect movie-- it isn't mind-blowingly spectacular, the CGI is often mediocre, and the film feels a little choppy, a result of Joss Whedon filling in for Zach Snyder near the end of the production & reshooting parts of the film. But it's fun to watch-- something lacking in Batman v Superman-- and it gets the characters right. Jason Momoa rocks as Aquaman, Ezra Miller makes for a comical, yet socially awkward new Flash, and Gal Gadot continues to nail Wonder Woman. More importantly, it gives fans reason to be excited for future DC movies like Aquaman, Flashpoint & Green Lantern Corps.The DCEU is still a work in progress. After the huge success of Wonder Woman, Justice League needed to build off of its momentum, in order to get the DC train up and running. It certainly does that, but certainly not as well as it could have done. It may be time for Warner Bros to part ways with Snyder, and hand the wheel over Whedon & Geoff Johns, in shaping this movie universe.",1
243,"I loved it! It was exciting and fun to see these heroes come together to form the Justice League! There is plenty of action and surprises. In the end, I thought it was a good story. Plus, the post credit scenes were great!",1
244,"It's a good movie, all characters do a good job, finally we can see a Superman that represents the really hope, the stereggs are magnificent, I don't understand what movie the critic saw, yes the movie isn't perfect, the CGI could be better, but meets with entertain. We can see a growth in all characters, principally in Flash. Watch the movie without paying attention to the ""specialized critic"", you will enjoy the movie",1
245,"Best DC Movie After The Dark Knight Trilogy.I don't understand why all that unjustified hate to the movie. Very well written and the story is great. Action scenes were excellent. i was afraid they won't be able to build the flash, Cyborg & Aquaman characters to fit in the movie but they brilliantly did. If you are a hardcore Dc fan, i promise you that you will love it. there is one scene that you wouldn't wanna miss and for me i would have paid money just to see that scene.",1
246,"Just like Superman v Batman, critics hated it, but I liked it.  The characters were far less than flat.  The dialog was solid.  I read that the villan was lacking...why?  He seemed pretty monsterous to me.  The story was tough to follow, but I don't see how that is any different from 90% of today's 100 mile/minute movies.  I need a pause button for all of them.  These superhero movies are fireworks shows, let's face it.  And this was a good one.  With a terrific finale.  I liked this movie as well as Wonder Woman.  Go see it, especially if you are a DC fan.",1
247,"Not a perfect movie, and suffers from pacing issues, but the movie is a lot of fun, and seeing the heroes on the screen for the first time pays off. The banter within the team makes this film work.",1
248,as a MCU fanboy i should just give it 0/10... but its actually really solid and fun movie with weak villain but awesome JL characters and good fights. Even i enjoy it so if you are DC fan you will most likely love it,1
249,"It is now loud and clear that there is a bias against DC Films. I agreethat the movie is not perfect and so are 90% of MCU. It is just thatthe film is not well polished. It could have used another 15-20 minutesof time that might have made it a better film more coherent with betterconclusions. (blame Warners for that). Even though its good now it justfeels like it skips. (hard to explain, you should see it for yourself).They should have released it in July' 18 where they got an empty slotfor a DC Film. (only in case Zack does the work as Joss would entirelychange the film given time). But here Joss really tried to make thefilm better for non-comic fans too. And it lays a path that drives DCFilms into greater places. I think that the 2 hours restriction madethe film what it is. If not it might have been perfect for those whoask for it. Anyways it is good enough and you can put it in the samespot along with AoU if you need a comparison. There it is. I go with8/10.",1
250,"I went and saw this movie last night not really expecting to much but wound up enjoying it more than any of the DC movies that have came out recently.  I mean I hated BVS and was thinking this was going to be more of the same but was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed JL.  The cast works well together and found myself smiling during certain scenes. The beginning left me wanting to see a batman movie after seeing more of Afflecks batman in Gotham.  There are some issues with this movie its by far not perfect but its a step in the right direction, its a great set up and an awesome action flick!",1
251,"This is a very fun movie. I could see the Joss Whedon touches in the script, it feels a bit more lighter, and even Superman seems more relaxed. But i think the movie suffers a lot with Zack Snyder's poor directing. First half of the movie was really slow paced and just an exposition show, which they should have made way more interactive instead of just people staring at eachother.Then there's the scene of Steppenwolf vs The Amazons which was so awesome that i almost stood up and applauded, supermans entrace against Steppenwolf was also genius, flash dialogue tried a lot to be funny at times, but sometimes it actually worked, cyborg character development was really good, as he was suffering from a tragedy, but after that interaction with The flash digging supermans grave that he was little by little starting to have fun, until the end where he says ""Booya"" in such a cool way that i screamed on the inside.So i had fun overall, but this movie suffers from poor directing specially in lack of pacing consistency",1
252,"This movie has some obvious flaws. It has plot holes, a few jokes that kinda fall flat, has a generic villain, and also has a bland/generic soundtrack. Weird thing is though, those are all the same things that most superhero movies released have. A lot of those movies get a pass though for some reason, and it honestly makes no sense. I don't have double standards, so I'm calling them all out. This movie is actually decent even with it's flaws. It has some great humor, great action, amazing characters and acting by each cast member. It also brings the DC comics to life on the big screen. It is an enjoyable and entertaining time, and definitely is a must see. Yeah, like I said, it has some flaws, but so does every movie, especially in this genre. It is no worse than the typical superhero movie you see. Give it a go, and see for yourself. You'll probably enjoy quite a lot about this film. It's definitely got heart.",1
253,Loved it. A proper mix of the previous films' take on superheroes while bringing in the Marvel styled comedy and pace. A Superman that smiles is the movies biggest improvement over the rest while the plot and message stay in form to MoS and BvS,1
254,"The critics (on this and Rotten Tomatoes and everywhere else) are out of their freaking minds.  If Wonder Woman is a 97, this is a 95 easily.  Easily as good as most Avenger films etc.  (Not as good as Thor: Ragnarok which I give a 10/100 or Guardians of the Galaxy 2 which scores the same 10/100to me).  My friends and I discussed it afterwards and we all agreed that it was fantastic.  Only issue was the CGI on Superman's face...and that gets explained once you hear the mustache story so this was not their fault, it looks like the Rogue One Grand Moff Tarkin stuff and is noticeable in one or two scenes then quickly forgotten about.  The supervillian is perhaps a bit mediocre (but my friend pointed out that five members of the team got handled by him), but that is what this movie had to have...it is about the formation of the Justice League.  There is comedy throughout, funny one liners, that the audience did seem to be afraid to laugh at.  Go to the theater, pay the ticket price, get some popcorn and a drink then enjoy the show.  Stay for BOTH scene extras.  You will be glad they took your money!",1
255,"Amazing that this movie is getting positive reviews. Sorry for all the hard work that was put into this movie but it's at best for children, every scene is predictable, the acting is terrible, almost a comedy, the dialogues are blend, not interesting, the special effect are not too bad. This caters to the masses who are amused with idiotic scenario. I almost fell asleep watching. But I guess people like garbage, like people like McDonalds.",0
256,"ABSOLUTELY what I (and plenty of others) wanted from a DC movie. This is the best version of the characters that we've ever seen on-screen, and I can't wait for the future.",1
257,"The critics, I don't really understand what happened? The movie is really awesome, go watch it! It was really a blast I'm sure the critics are biased and they have all been bought by Marvel.",1
258,"Excelente película, entretenida de principio a fin. Si quieres ver una gran película de super héroes esta es la tuya es un comic en movimiento.Recomendada.",1
259,"Brilliant movie, it sure has a lot to offer. It's a good step-up from previous movies, and a new start for the next ones in the DCEU. I recomend you to go and watch it.",1
260,"Critics are drunk i guess, the movie was great, and audience were cheering for this one saw this for the first time for a Hollywood movie. Don't listen to critics, you should have your own head to make decisions. Watch it and decide.",1
261,"I didn't think the movie was bad as critic says... Only the CGI and the villian are not as good as the rest... The comeback of superman was pretty good too. I recommend this movie to anyone. Is not the best movie of super-heroes, but it is good",1
262,"As much as I enjoyed watching “Justice League”, it could have been so much better. You absolutely get some great performances out of the actors and can tell they’re having fun. “Justice League” did the impossible really, bringing the Justice League together and giving them enough rapport with each other to believe they’re a team. If you can make it past the horrid visual effects, odd story choices, and the film being dictated by the critics, you’ll have an enjoyable experience. And at the moment, this is the only way to see the Justice League other than in comics or animation. That’s not really a ringing endorsement is it?  for more go to: https://wp.me/p93it6-1MC",1
263,"Please don't be discouraged by the really low numbers, this is a great comic book movie! Do i think it is perfect? No. I also didn't think the latest Thor movie was perfect either.. Its much better than 46 I promise you...",1
264,"Justice League, for the shorter than expected time we have with the movie, entertains and delights as DC and the WB see a turning point for their brand. The makers of this movie have listened to the criticisms of Batman vs Superman and created a superhero movie that is uplifting and most of all... Fun. The characters finally seem to enjoy being superheroes and being part of a team to save the world. Each character is given their moment to shine and no one feels ignored or marginalised. While the editing of the film cuts many worthwhile scenes to create a 2 hour max runtime, you dont feel like you were robbed any crucial part of the story. The movie leaves you wanting to see the next adventure of these heroes and that's a great place for a movie to leave its audience.If you enjoy superhero films and enjoyed Man of Steel and Wonder Woman, this movie is a must see for you. A solid 8 out of 10.",1
265,"it was a great movie, a lot of action, character interaction was great, splendid acting, though the cgi was a bit bad, and the movie was a bit too fast, it was still such a great movie, it was beautifullpeople hate what they dont understand - martha kentthe one who say this movie was bad , just dont understand this movie very well",1
266,"Great film, very enjoyable. Batman is great, Wonder Woman is impressive and Superman is more super than ever. The new characters are really good. Ciborg is serious, Aquaman is cool and Flash is... kinda silly but you end up liking him as he is.",1
267,okei the CGI effects on Superman mouth because of hi mustache ist way too horrible!But the movie itself is very enjoyable. Sometimes i thought flash is a bit too goofy.,1
268,"Don't listend to the critics or those who score it with 0 (really? worse movie ever made?); They are only marketing and fanboyism victims! This movie is great! You are really missing out if you skip it! Action secuences are impressive, WW, The Amazons, The final fight!",1
269,"I went into this with pretty low expectations - some of the reviews were pretty positive, but most seemed mixed - with the exception of a few negatives that seemed to be from reviewers with zero interest in this type of movie.By the time the credits, and the two stings, were finished - I was really pleasantly surprised. I went with a friend who hated both BvS and Suicide Squad and he loved it - preferring it to Wonder Woman. The CGi is fine for most of the movie - one or two effects I didn't love, but no worse than the effects on earth towards the end of Guardian of the Galaxy 2 - which I saw no mention of in any reviews.Story moved on quite swiftly - I think another 15 /20 minutes in there wouldn't have hurt, but that's more down to me wanting to see more of this movie than being a criticism of the movie as it stands.Overall it was a lot of fun, very funny in parts, earnest in others. Just the right mix as far as I'm concerned. Will be back in to see it again this weekend",1
270,"I liked Justice League but I really wanted to love it. Some of the Pros for me were (Spoilers incoming):  It had some great scenes. Wonder Woman saving the children from the terrorist, the Amazons conducting an awesome relay race with a Mother Box, seeing a Green Lantern in the flashback,  the Flash trying to come up on a deranged Superman and realizing too late just how fast Superman is, Aquaman surfing through a building on a parademon and crashing through the front, the Flash being proud of saving a family in a pick-up truck only to see Superman fly by with a building of people, and the mid and end credit scenes were pure DC fanboy service. I also liked the brighter color palette and lighter tone in the film. In terms of character's I really liked the Flash and the more happy and hopeful Superman. Aquaman didn't have much character development but I liked what little bit I saw. Justice League deserves credit for making Aquaman look cool, a feat I would have said was impossible just a few short years ago. I liked that there was a callback to the old Christopher Reeve Superman theme.The cons for me were: Batman. He was unrecognizable to me from BvS. He seemed almost campy at times (that's not good in my book). Its ok for Batman to be dark and brooding. That's integral to his character. Just don't make every character dark and brooding. Find each character's core.  Some of the humor felt forced, especially from Batman. Aquaman was reduced to basically a collection of one-liners and catch phrases. The CGI around Steppenwolf's face was not every expressive at all. I really liked his voice, I just wish he had more interesting dialogue. He was a pretty thin villain in terms of motivation and backstory (though most comic book movie villains are other than Loki and Magneto). I thought  Wonder Woman's civilian wardrobe was too revealing and really walked back some of the great characterization Patty Jenkins did in creating a strong, female hero in Wonder Woman. Some of her shirts were ridiculously and unnecessarily low cut. Cyborg didn't do anything for me and he is the only character that I'm not interested in seeing in future films. Overall, I liked the movie but really wanted to be blown away by it. I liked Wonder Woman, Superman, Aquaman (I still can't believe I'm writing that), and the Flash. I was a Batfleck fan but now would be fine if he retired from the cowl and someone else stepped in with a bit more gravitas. There were some moments where a potentially great movie peaked through but never materialized. It's worth a viewing and you'll probably enjoy it if you go in looking for a basic comic book movie with some great action scenes.",1
271,"This movie is by no means perfect. It does feel rushed at only 2 hours. There is a lot happening and it does seem like a bit more time with the stories of the villain, Victor, Barry and Arthur could have helped the audience connect even more with the story. The villain is one note, but it does leave us with more time to focus on the heroes and their journeys to becoming a team. There are places where you wish the effects team had more time with the CGI to refine it and make it better. The best comparison that I can make would be the DC animated films that have come out over the last few years or some of your favorite episodes of Justice League United, if you liked those, you’ll like this. Overall, what wins you over is the team, their dynamic and the charisma they bring to each moment. Justice League is rated 4 out of 5 resurrections.",1
272,"Loved it. If you liked Batman V Superman or Wonderwoman than you may like this. We loved the direction these movies started with in Man of Steel, this, like the marvel movies, is a continuation of the narrative and style set. Cyborg CGI was lame, only complaint really, they should have learned from Iron Man and went with practical effects. Aquaman rocks, Flash rocks, Cyborg rocks, Wonder Woman rocks, and Supes showing up at the end to save the day was awesome. Cant wait to go see it a second time in the theater.",1
273,"I didn't like Suicide Squad even though I was really excited for it, I didn't like Batman VS Superman even though I was excited for it and I didn't like Man of Steel even though I was excited for it. However I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The characters were all great, starting off with The Flash, who they made to be a very likeable character. Meanwhile Aquaman was well acted and developed and also was likeable. I was expecting to hate Cyborg, but they made his backstory interesting and also not long, so I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked the character. Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman were all what you'd expect them to be. The story flowed nicely and there wasn't any scenes where I wanted to skip, or was bored in, like in other superhero films. Some downsides are that the villain wasn't very strong in my opinion, and I didn't really understand their story or appeal. Another downside I thought was that sometimes the CGI was a little shabby, in fact it bugged me at points when it was only the villains on screen. Any CGI where there were the heroes involved though was very good. Another minor complaint is that I thought there were quite a few jokes that I felt were rushed in there for the sake of getting a joke in, and simply weren't funny. At the end of the day, I highly recommend getting out as soon as possible to watch this film, it's a super fun ride.",1
274,"I really enjoyed this movie! It is true that it is far from perfect (no movie is perfect though). The story is lacking and the movie too short in my opinion. Also, the villain isn't quite what we would have hoped for, but the team chemistry is really fun! Cyborg is a revelation to me, The Flash steals the show and there are some humor in the movie. The 2 post-credit scenes are a must see! This movie is a stepping stone for other movies. Go see it and make your own opinion because the best critic is yourself.",1
275,"Filme bem legal, um de seus pontos fracos é seu filme antecessor, os personagens estão bacanas e a ação é boa mais nada memorável, o vilão é genérico não foi digno de uma Liga da Justiça a Liga merecia mais é a Liga da Justiça Man. Tinha que ser Épico, mais fechou satisfatoriamente pra mim.",1
276,"For what it is the move is very fun. I mean, it's not Lawrence of Arabia, but for a pretty basic popcorn action movie with super heroes it was pretty fun. I enjoyed the the action, I laughed at some parts (mostly involving the Flash but Aquaman was kinda awesome too). This movie was also the first time I have liked Superman since Superman III. He had a really interesting depiction in the movie. There are things which I found to be drawbacks in the movie. Some of the CGI was particularly awful. The villain wasn't really particularly great, it kinda reminded me of like an oceans movie where they are just getting a bunch of awesome dudes together to fight something, and most of the plot seemed to be about getting the people together rather than actually fighting evil. Once everyone was together the stakes seemed pretty low, I basically knew they were going to win. At the same time, I did have fun, which I think is the biggest thing I look for in movies like this.",1
277,"Excelente pelicula, quien quiere verle peros y problemas los ve, yo fui al cine a ver una buena pelicula y me a parecido muy entretenida quiero mas de DC.",1
278,I have enjoyed the film.Honest confession guys.If you like super hero action flicks then it's a must see film.Gal gatod & Ben Affleck were pretty cool also.,1
279,"League Of Justice is a fresh breeze for what had been the DCEU, it does not become what Wonder Woman was, but it certainly surpasses its other predecessors.In this film you can notice the workmanship of the two directors Zack Znyder and Josh Whedon, the two put their personal touches that are more noticeable in some than in other scenes. The most pleasant and endearing of the film is the chemistry of its characters.It has several mistakes and errors such as: Arguments holes, overflows of frames and subplots that do not always have a solution and a villain without any sense and it seems that its sole purpose is to have an excuse to unite the league.But all these errors can be in the background, because the fun of the film may not pay much attention.In conclusion: League Of Justice is an entertaining film, necessary for the DCEU. It has its errors that sometimes can overcome the successes of the film, but quickly fix it with the presence of the characters, which are equally presented and each has its exact setting on stage.",1
280,"Pay no attention to the ""professional"" critics out there, this movie is worth the time. It definitely takes the bad taste out of my mouth from their previous movies. The movie has non stop action, some pretty funny moments, and all the actors hit their stride giving a great performance. I wish it had a bit more superman in it, but at least he uses his heat vision for more then warming up an old woman's porridge!",1
281,"if people stop giving a damn about the critic reviews/ratings and stop comparing it to any marvel, previous DC movies or think who directed the movie - and just once., go watch it(after getting to know the basics of the characters of'course), they would LOVE ""ALL of it""!! *peace*",1
282,Justice League is a great continuation in the DC cinematic universe. The film has great action and comedy. Most people that love comic book movies will most likely love this one. This is a film that everyone should go see in the theaters.It was a blast to watch.,1
283,No movie is perfect and this is a movie that DC fans will love. I have been waiting for so long to see a movie of my favorite heroes. And everyone should see this movie and have their own opinion about it. Not what others are saying.,1
284,"Finally a DC movie that makes you happy. In a 10 minute scen from this movie I got to see what I wanted from Batman v Superman and none of the crap. Only bad scen is the last credit scene, but you can skip that. Worth a watch.",1
285,"This was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a very long time, and has to be my favorite super hero movie of the year.The character interactions were great, and if you're a comic book fan, you'll like it.",1
286,"Absolutely loved it, went in fearing the worst after ‘critics’ reviews but it was fun, exciting and the chemistry between the heroes was spot on. Much better than the awful Wonder Woman and builds on BvS, injecting humour and heart. See it, judge for yourself and ignore the Critics reviews.",1
287,"Seriously, this movie is great! The characters feel lifelike, the plot feels ripped right out of the comics, and the only real drawback is the abhorrent CGI. Well done DC.",1
288,What a wonderful nostalgia to relive this dream of a child. A Justice League movie was always a great yearning for me. It's exciting from start to finish.,1
289,"It is a fun and enjoyable movie to watch with very cool caracters that just need a back grownd storie to be more imersive. The real complain about the movie is around the villan that should have been explored, on his motivations and to whom he is connected.I guess that the low scores that the movie is receveing is because it doesn't reach the critcs' expectations...",1
290,"A fan since MOS, BVS, SS, and WW; I thoroughly enjoyed Justice League.  Although a bit choppy and short with the editing I am sure the extended cut will be amazing!  This movie is a must if you love DC!!!",1
291,"This movie was exactly what I was waiting for. Only problem stands with lack of origin story for heroes like Cyborg, Aquaman or Flash, but we know that the third one will get his solo movie. In my opinion strong 8.",1
292,Trash movie. Ben affleck is the worst batman ever. Cyborg and Aquaman is useless. Flash is unfunny,0
293,"Creo que es una de las mejores peliculas que se han hecho sobre DC, espero que sigan con ese buen ritmo y nunca se combiertan en marvel que es para niños.",1
294,"simply a good movie, i don´t understand the hate i was sleeping with the generics mosnter in avengers 2 but here they are no so much and the fight of the menbers of the justice league against superman is fantastic, fantastic scene, really. When critics talk about marvel movies they say is just a movie and it´s fun bla bla, well here they expect the answer to the meaning of life when the casi is the same",1
295,"Didn't defend BvS/SS, will gladly defend Justice League.It's got some rough edges, sure, and we'll likely see a definitive cut at some point, but it nailed the heart. I found myself grinning at the spectacle, and the warmer scenes where our heroes questioned each other, etc.Not a 10, but that's to offset some of the overly harsh reviews we're likely to see here. Overall, it played like a great episode of the Justice League animated series (a bit messy but made you love it in the end), rather than a great Justice League animated movie. Which means that it could have been a 10, but powered through closer to an 8. Which means it's certainly worth watching.",1
296,"I saw this movie there 2 hours and unfortunately this movie is the worst ""super-hero"" movie I have ever seen ",0
297,"I'ts a beautiful movie! A dream come true to watch this movie! Zack Snyder is an excellent director and it was sad not to have finished justice league. Even so I loved the action scenes and all the scenarios. Negative side is the uninteresting villain, but already better than most of marvel-disney. I recommend everyone to watch !!",1
298,"**** the critics and go see the movie. It's very good, well balanced, has the right tone of humor and serious moments, each character have their highlights (especially Flash and Aquaman), great interaction between them, really cool action scenes. Best DC movie ever and one of the best movies I ever watched.",1
299,"Just got back from seeing the Justice League and I absolutely loved every minute, from start to finish. The heroes bond well together and it was a joy to see them on screen together. There was plenty of action and also the occasional moments of humour. Definitely wait until the very end of the credits as there is a worthwhile scene at the end. All in all, I cant wait to see it again and also see the future films down the line",1
300,"A bit better or maybe even better than Batman V. Superman, but not quite a masterpiece. Justice League delivers awesome action and likable characters, but some of those characters could've used more screen time or moments to shine and stand out. A nice step away from the darker grittiness of Batman V. Superman and into the lighter humorous side of a new team of heroes. Justice league provides a good handful of Easter eggs and hype for future heroes and villains to come to the DCEU.",1
301,"Went in and had a good time. Seriously, **** the critics. Too dark, too humorous, too convoluted too simple. For the love of god make up your minds and quit comparing these films to Marvel. Not all superhero films have to be the same. Anyone curious should judge it for themselves.",1
302,"This is a flawed movie sure, but I still got plenty of enjoyment out of this. The chemistry between the heroes was great andI thought the action was a lot of fun. Plus, they finally got Superman right. I'd recommend it.",1
303,A dream come true for any COMIC BOOK reading fan... most of the negative reviewers of this movie probably have never even picked up a comic book in their lives,1
304,"This is definitely the best superhero film of 2017! It features a great cast of characters and does a good job of introducing the newer characters into the fold. The team up overall was thrilling. Was very entertaining. The CGI wasn't nearly as bad as people are making it out to be... and the villain wasn't too bad either. Also, don't listen to the critics, they praised Marvel movies with good reviews on key points that they bashed Justice League for with negatives reviews. If you are a fan of superhero movies.. this is a must see!",1

306,"La Liga de la Justicia ha sido lo que tenía que ser: la continuación del arco que comenzó en Batman v Superman. Entretenida, sabrosa recomendada, fue más al grano con la historia, aunque, faltó ese detalle del suspenso casual, pero fue firmes con el enemigo; ojo no al estilo Michael Bay, pero faltó quizas la presencia de espectáculo de explosiones en lugares con mayor concurrencia, pero se manejo la situación en un punto determinado.a película se siente como el fragmento faltante de Batman v Superman, como si se hubiese fragmentado en dos películas, y que para comprender la película de la Liga en su mayor expresión, se debe retomar ver Batman v Superman, porque si las unes, estas viendo una sola y verdadera cinta, como si fuesen unidas a una versión extendida (a pesar de que Batman v Superman individualmente si posee su versión extendida), haciendo que ambas películas se completen entre sí. A eso, se jugó para este filme, una pieza de rompecabezas que hacía falta, se notó que el recorte fue adecuado en ciertas escenas menos dos, pero son pasables, el villano, parecía algo atolondrado, pero no es porque fuera malo que decepcione, porque el personaje ve con otra mirada al mundo contemporáneo que fue distinto al visto en los flashbacks; además, este villano como malo no es como tal, en el sentido de aburrido o o tonto, sino que es el malo haciendo cosas de villanos de cómics, dándole presencia y un carácter de un ser extraño en tierras extrañas, haciendo de este personaje que buscaba complacer a su lealtad del lugar de donde proviene, si le faltó la mascota característica de Steppenwolf, de hecho, se le extraña la mascota canina Apokolitana, hubiese puesto más en aprietos a uno que otro personaje en los cómics, si tuviese que definir como villano a Steppenwolf en un podio, estaría tan solo detrás de el General Zod; por delante de Ares y Doomsday en el DCEU. Por otro lado, muy buena reaparición de Superman.Quizás si faltó la presencia de las autoridades globales y mostrar algo más global que la película se desarrollase escenarios donde los héroes combaten separados al momento de enfrentar una crisis, pero, lo compensa que ya lo habían hecho en Batman v Superman, al menos en pequeños fragmentos.Prácticamente, esta película se desarrolló derivando que la ligereza le cayó anillo al dedo, porque la necesitaba, después de que se concentró en asuntos donde los personajes iniciaban al comienzo haciendo sus cosas casuales, por eso mismo esta película es como si hubiese sida dividida una obra literaria como cuando dividieron la saga de El Hobbit en tres películas, y asímismo lo sentí de Batman v Superman a Liga de la Justicia: Un arco duro y luego un arco ligero y así se puede entender mejor ambas películas, que es casi como cuando sonó en su momento existió ese rumor que Batman v Superman iban a dividirla en dos películas que al final nunca sucedió, pero la Liga de la Justicia realmente el desenlace de lo visto en Batman v Superman, por lo que debería considerarse BvS en la precuela que armó a la Liga de la Justicia. Aunque noté que existían pocas referencias a los cómic, quizás no me di cuenta, pero una de las escenas post-créditos si es una clásica referencia a un cómic de Superman post-Crisis. Y quizás otra razón más para comprender un poquitín mejor las incongruencias de Batman v Superman que la gente comenta.Personajes:- Cyborg: Se notó muchismo que su personaje abrió esperanzas de ver su película, a pesar que en los cómics hasta ahora le han ido creando sus propios villanos, y gustó porque se sintó su tragedia personal.- Flash: Muy cómico, pero resalta un poco exagerado su forma introvertida de mostrarse con las personas algo molesto, pero es un detalle que hiera al personaje, sino que muestra una forma de trauma a causa de la muerte de su madre como en los cómics, pero al final, es el carisma inocente.- Batman: preocupado por compensar lo hecho en BvS, pero que logra acentuar a un gran personaje que me recordó como guiño la etapa de los 60's- Aquaman: el Rudo y el chico clásico sufista, que vive retraido, pero que logra evolucionar una quimica con el equipo. Tuvo un buen humor.- Wonder Woman: Inmejorable, como lo fue en Wonder Woman simplemente sensacional.- Superman: Aunque muy poco tiempo en su regreso, al final termina volviendo como característica principal, como la esperanza.En cuanto al CGI a veces es tan difícil de observar en 3D, pero lo vi normalito, y no soy experto en eso, tendrías que estudiar animación o alguna carrera donde los defectos se detecten, pero eso es porque la escenografía y la fotografía de la película compensa el estilo oscuro y se va dislumbrado en una tonalidad cambiante, algo que ya es casual con el cine de Zack Snyder",1
307,"Una gran película, los integrantes de la liga tienen muy buena química, bastante acción y varias referencias al comic, el humor funciona muy bien,  100% recomendada",1
308,"Não entendo esse rage todo desses criticos contra a dc e seus filmes,o filme da Liga da justiça é um filme bom e bem executado,com algumas falhas mais nada que possa causar uma media critica tão baixa como está tendo,reclamaram tanto de BVS que a liga foi usada pra conserta o que tinha em bvs que pra mim é um filme muito bom,o filme tem suas falhas infelizmente por varios problemas de produções coisa que os criticos não levam em consideração,pra mim foi um filme bom e que só acrescenta mais a esse universo que a dc criou,vou ver novamente e depois só esperar pra ver Aquaman que acredito que vai ser um ótimo filme.",1
309,"Novamente a DC com o mesmo final previsível que tira toda a graça do filme, em que o surper heroi (bem mais forte que o vilão) aparece e da uma surra no vilão (Obvio).Fora os finais em que o super-herói ganha forças ""do alem"" após uma frase de efeito ou um aliado morre em combate(Lanterna Verda, Mulher Maravilha, Batman Vs Superman, Homem de Aço).Chega a ridicularizar a participação dos vilões no filme, denegrindo a imagem do Lobo.",0
310,"Un desastre. Guión inexistente, el villano es patético, los personajes no tienen química y se ven viejos. Superman tiene menos expresividad que una piedra. Y el resto no genera empatía.",0
311,"Before I begin, let me remind you that this is a 'movie' that was reportedly made on a $300 million budget after extensive reshoots and post-production. To call this diabolical disaster a film, is doing a great disservice to the idea of sanity and competency. Yet after 5 years of half-arsing to mimic Marvel's success, the band of ponzi schemers known as Warner Fraudsters manages to produce a film more inchoherent and boring than your grandparent's racist rants. Justice League by far is the worst disaster of a movie I have seen come from this genre and that is saying something compared with cancers like Fantastic Four and Schumacher's Batman accident. Yet I have never seen something so stupid and uninteresting at the same time.As a kid that has grown up with the animated justice league series, this so called 'justice league' takes a huge dump on its own universe it tires to set up previously, filled with gaping plotholes and a CGI sheetshow that makes Catwoman a masterpiece. There is nothing remotely interesting about this film with so many inconsistencies and and cringe that you wonder which poor disabled person did they force to write this disaster. For a film that is supposed to feel epic and aatually be the crowning jewel of the DC Universe, its safe to say the only enjoyment you will get out of this film is the couple of cheeky butt shots of Wonder Woman throughout this bore. You think you saw a bad film with Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman, wait until you see this disaster. Not only does this film bore you with tedious character expositions and barebone character development, the action (the only thing decent from previous entries) manages to be the most mindless mishap since Bill Clinton forgetting to put on a condom. There is literally a scene where Batman and Wonder Hore walks alongside the beach dumping exposition whilst the black cyborg stalks them like the stereotypic image one conjurs. Remember when the DC fan boys had a whinge about Marvel being too 'fun' and 'jokey', well guess what, this is just as stupid and dry as anything put on screen. The humour is forced and you will be laughing how bad it is as a result. The tonal inconsistencies are also something to behold. At one point you'll be watching a Snyder film, then suddenly a Whedon film and then suddenly a Terrence Malick film. I cried with laughter as midway through the film when the writers decide to introduce to the young innocent children the beautiful concepts of grave robbing and breaking into government property without persmission are all perfectly fine because our heroes decide it is. At this point, I'm not even sure why its called Justice league given that justice is the least of their concerns. Warner Brother also continues with their maternal fetish, when we have our animated in China villain Steppenwolf decries his love for 'mother' as many times that Martha popped up in B v S. Oooo remember how you were excited to see Jk Simmonds to play Commissioenr Gordon? Well he literally pops up briefly in two scenes and both where he does literally nothing. Also don't expect any references to any other characters or possible future members because literally this film adds nothing to the loreAt this point, the DCEU hates their own films and the audience so much that they don't even bother with logical consistencies and the universe they set up with previous films. Where is the military in this film? Why does Themesclyra suddenly have like 10,000 of soliders? Why is Wonder Woman suddenly in Paris fighting crime whenever she wants? Why is Batman not capturing the criminals he baits but then just leaves? Where does Flash get his money from to afford his hangout despite not having a job? Many more questions that will pop up in every scene which surely must be some sort of records. Even watching this mess with my brain turned off, is more cancerous than **** The soundtrack is also abhorently lazy with a lack of any themes that was established previous as even the composer knows there is nothing heoric here. Not only does Danny Elfman not give a crap, people are praising him literally stealing his own music theme for Batman over 3 decades ago as though this is good? Does fricking John Williams just play the first Star Wars music for all his film? No, that's because hes not a hack. This film manages to make me appreciate Batman v Superman more as that mess attempts to actually create a world and a somewhat believalabe plot. I don't blame Snyder here because his visiual flare is clearly absent here meaning someone else had control into what we seen and that can only be attributable to the Warner Hacks. In summary to what you will see, or what you have already saw, Justice League is a disaster that only a studio that hates comics and superhero can ever produce. This is an unmitigated disaster that not only is cancerous but demands to be taken to the back of the farm to be put down from its miserable existence.",0
312,"I think that the batman scene was very good at the beginning and then cut very fast. Poor repair, okay movie.   I'll wait for the next movie.  cheer up",1
313,"Justice League has surprised me, because in this new installment of Zack Snyder and Wheedon have unified in a uniform way in terms of surprises and humor that is favorable in this saga, I really did not expect much from this movie and maybe because that same thing I was very pleasant surprise to discover that it is fun, with a villain that imposes and know that this delivery is about true gods.",1
314,"Fun movie. Full of fan service and with great post credit scenes also. I laugh, felt the drama and walked out of the cinema with HOPE RENEWED. Not an exceptional movie, but a really great one.",1
315,"I truly loved this movie. Usually I hate DC movies, but this was genuine fun - maybe the professional critics didn't get the memo - we want our movies to be fun, our heroes strong and the unlikely friendships to be real. Bring the kids, this is a great ride!",1
316,"Pros:The opening scene with Superman The intro song and the old school scoresThe Chemistry of the cast is goodFlash great Superman OP!!!!The Fight choreography is gr8The 2 post credit scenes with the race and legion of doom are amazing !!!ConsShorter LengthScenes of certain characters and character arcs are noticeably cutNo Seventh Member Hal Jordan- Green Lantern supriseLess Steppenwolf(main villain) action All in all a great movie, would like to watch it again and recommend to any casual/ hardcore fans.",1
317,"OMG, had so much fun. I was quiet impressed the even with a very boring bad guy this movie could be so good. Every character was so well balanced, even aquaman man us very interesting (now I wanna see his solo movie).Great movie, go watch it. Mavel should learn from this movie how to make comedy, don't make the whole movie a comedy like thor ragnarok. Learn it with the flash. :D",1
318,"As far as superhero action films go, this was a great one. It had great action scenes, memorable moments, and was a lot of fun to watch. It is a must see in the theater as the small screen could never do it JUSTICE. As far as action goes, it's in a LEAGUE of its own. Ignore the naysayers, these comments, generally speaking, are probably from people who either dislike the genre altogether, are overly critical of minutia details, or are Marvel Superfans.",1
319,"It's good.  Not like OMG the best, but enough that I think its a bit of a toss up Avengers 1 or Justice League. The beginning is a bit rough, and obvious that the sexists had a strong hand in it - the Amazons in leather bikinis, the lame, stilted dialogue between Amy Adams and Diane Lane - takes a incredibly poor director to force a bad performance by those two very fine actors - but once you move past the early stages of the movie that include the ham-fisted treatment of women, it gets better.  I really hope Zack Snyder never makes another movie.  The cast and the writers carried it.",1
320,"#JusticeLeague was a enjoyable blast. Its fun, it partially answered to the critiques of previous DCEU movies, and compared to other DCEU movies it gave you a simple enough plot to just set up all the great humor and action. Its not ""perfect"" & the narrative isn't the smoothest -- but JL gives the audience high-energy escapism, with plenty of great moments, and the promise of great things to come from the DC Universe. Its a blast compared to BvS & Suicide Squad; and although it isn't the game-changing 180° push that Wonder Woman provided, it still provides a good enough push that highly entertains as much as it satisfies. Seeing the League members' interaction & chemistry was all great & crowd-pleasing, and every member had their own moments to shine. It actually felt like watching the ol' Justice League & Super Friends cartoons of yesteryear, which is definitely a plus, tapping into the pure ComicBook fandom & nostalgia of it all. We also get many great visual shots & dialogue, as well as a solid musical score. Loved the #GaryClarkJr cover of ""Come Together"", which perfectly fits the purpose of bringing these heroes together for the world to see, as well as the tone, excitement, and fun that the movie delivers",1
321,"The Justice League movie far surpassed my expectations. After a mediocre film in Man of steel, followed by the disappointing BVS and SS, I thought the DCMU was dead in the water.  Wonder Woman was great, but I was afraid it was a one off. The JL movie made me breathe a sigh of relief. The film was fun with just the right amount of seriousness, the new heroes were great, and it had a simple coherent plot. I really think DC learned from its mistakes and is moving in the right direction.  New comer Ezra Miller as the flash is definitely the best addition and Bro-quaman and Cyborg brought some interesting dynamics with them. Some reviewers stated that they disliked the early scene transitions, but to me it was a small flaw for the sake of run time. The tone did feel off at times, but I didn’t feel as if it was a game changer.Not saying this film is for everyone, but for someone that didn’t like other DCMU (other than WW) I left the theater entertained and happy.",1
322,"There must be something wrong with the critics, I admit the CGI was flawed but the character interactions and their humor makes this an awesome and entertaining movie, better than what the ""blind"" critics are saying.",1
323,"Before I start, literally just registered to review this film. I gave it an 8/10 because while it did have flaws and issues with being too predictable, it's not a bad film! ==================Coming from a Batman fan, I gotta say they toned his darkness a lot in this film relative to BvS. Still, I had to remind myself that this isn't a Batman film. But hot damn, Affleck's acting was watered down compared to what we saw in BvS. It's like Ben wasn't even trying or perhaps the script handed to him didn't make him try hard enough.Wonder Woman, Flash, and even Superman was portrayed really well whether you're a comic book fan or a casual. They actually succeeded in making a League film that didn't portray Batman as the go-to guy, opposite to what the animated franchise almost consistently dishes out (much to my joy, of course).Cyborg...he's a bit edgy and emo, but I totally don't need a film to know his **** I can't say the same with Aquaman, and I have to say Aquaman's character lacked depth. He needed a previous film for sure.And yes, the villain choice could've been so much better or at least introduced into the series from another film like the MCU does with Thanos.=========================So I agree with a lot of people saying it's better than Suicide Squad (LEAGUES better), only 3/4 of Wonder Woman's standards, and a notch above BvS in terms of story telling, but a notch below for character and plot.Justice League listened to the audience and made sure it was light and funny, but I think they also forgot about the fans who actually want something different than what the MCU is currently showing. I guess you can't please everyone.With that said, Justice League played it safe this time and to many comic book and ""new"" superhero fans, they played it too safe. They will always be compared to Marvel no matter what they do and I think they made the error of trying to look like a Marvel film rather than being better or at least something else entirely.PS: The aspect of teamwork is so much better than the Avengers and don't you deny it.",1
324,"I don't know where to start. The movie lacks anything. I laughed maybe once during the entire movie. I noticed that there were moments that you were supposed to laugh but was rather lame. The Flash is the worst. Okay, he tries to be funny but all I see is lame attempts. Also, why is Flash such a **** I like the Netflix The Flash but he does not live up to that. Also, a 2 Hour movie introducing 3 new characters and resurrecting another? The movie just sucks on all fronts. I had a hard time watching it the first time.",0
325,"It tends to be a bumpy ride at times, but overall, ""Justice League"" is a fun and ultimately enjoyable watch that was worth the wait. I'm just hoping that Warner Bros., DC Entertainment, and everyone else involved can learn from the lessons that their 2017 releases taught them. Try your damnedest to keep it simple. Try your damnedest to keep it light. And try your damnedest to make it feel like it matters. These are three things that I think the powers-that-be at least attempted with ""Justice League,"" which is a good sign, but you can tell it was a trial to meld the parts that they had into the product they wanted. Here's to hoping that the ensuing DCEU properties are more in line with the two we received this year.",1
326,"While JL ain't great, it has the hallmarks to be it. First a little of the bad stuff.Its clear there was a lot more in this movie then we got to see. Because of it, a lot of the backstories for these characters were sacrificed. And Steppenwolf is a sh*t villain. Now the good stuff. The characters work. And work well. When all 6(hint hint) of these heroes get on screen it's pure magic, man.The action is pretty awesome too. Nothing ground breaking but one particular ""clash of the titans"" scene at the end of the second act was just awesomeness.The critics are valid, but the rating is wrong. This had problems but nothing too terrible.This ain't great but its pretty damn good.",1
327,Pretty good movie you can tell it had two directors though. I had to dock a few points for the really racist part in the beginning with white guy attacking the Muslim woman and the cop steps in is really insulting in a world where Muslims drive cars into crowds of white people too often so yea 4/10.,1
329,I really liked this movie. It showed the group coming together to fight the oncoming visit of doomsday. It was linear and made more sense than Batman vs. Superman. Gal Gadot does such an excellent job of playing Wonderwoman showing the heart of that character fighting for love rather than hatred. I hope there is another movie with Darkside.,1
331,"Go with an open mind and teenage heart!  Loved this movie and waited a long time for it.  Don't listen to all the naysayers - great fun!  Wish they made the movie longer and not so much CGI.  Still, a great experience.",1
333,"""Justice League"" "" is, to some degree, DC Comics' equivalent of ""Captain America: Civil War"". You have superheroes meeting each other (with obvious tension and conflict). You even have a wet behind the ears young superhero who practically steals the film. With that aside, it's great to see Aquaman FINALLY get some due respect. This film is likely to further secure the careers of Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, and Ray Fisher (Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg respectively). Steppenwolf makes an awesome villain as he comes on the screen like heavy metal thunder (You really didn't think I was going to let that get by, did you?). I do find J. K. Simmons as Commisioner Gordon to be a bit misplaced (as much as I admire him as an actor). The action and cinematography are nothing short of spectacular. I didn't find this movie to be as much of a ""knock out of the park"". Still, this movie is worth seeing and will have you looking forward to the next installment. Check it out.",1
334,"Critics are not getting the tone of this movie. They seem to be comparing it to marvel and the mistakes of the BvS incident. Which I don't mind but they really have to get with the times. DC have learned a lesson from the dark tone duds and lightened up a lot even when it is dealing with the end of the world. The start is a bit rushed in bringing the team together but it calms down and creates a good chemistry and team effort in the vein of the old justice league comics and animated series. Highly recommend this to any DC fans out there,you won't be disappointed.",1
335,"To be honest I feel like most of the viewers always finds a way of disliking a DC Movie, (Colors are darker, Running time is too long & now with all fixed CGI is poor) Common now, Be done with it. DCEU shows you the real image of what happens If these characters are introduced to you in real life, Which feels awesome and gets me more interested for their next movie. With DCEU delivering ""Justice League"" introducing more characters with rich back backgrounds. MCU have a silent storm coming for them. Think real for a second saving the world doesn't mean you have to include more jokes in the movie (It's a superhero movie not a standup comedy show). For me evaluating a proper superhero movie of 2017, JL wins by miles. ""GO WATCH & SEE FOR YOURSELF""",1
336,"nice conclusion to the snyder trilogy, although you can feel WB's executives presence and that 2 directors worked on the project. the chemistry is real and everything looks interesting for the future. btw, man of steel and BvS are my favorite comic book movies...",1
337,"Yes the movie has a couple of flaws, (not the best CGI villain and pretty pathetic way to lose a Mother Box), but it is hugely a fun film. The character interaction is spot on, the action sequences are spot on and although it is a simplistic story line it is straight forward and logical. All the heroes are well cast and I look forward to future movies. Can't see why the critics are gripping about this.",1
338,"For the first time the Justice League comes out to the comics and TV. The epic reunion is wonderfull, amazing to see all those legendary characters. Wonder Woman steal the show yet, the amazonians, old gods and atlantes are the best, but wanted to see more. Batman is less dark and serious but still is that great Batman from BsV, Steppenwolf and de parademons do their job, Aquaman is a badass man, Flash is sooo nice and Cyborg is fine, and superman ... When they are all together is just brilliant, 30 years waiting to see this epic cinema fact. I needed more time one screen, a list 50 minutes, the soundtrack is forgetable. And the last post credit scene tells a lot for coming. Hope Snyder could've done and finished all the job. Whedon didn't do that well. But the movie is amazing. Let's wait for Shazam, Aquaman, The Batman, Wonder Woman 2, Man of Steel 2, Gotham City Sirens, Suicide Squad 2, Justice League 2, Cyborg, Green Lantern Corps, Nightwing, Black Adam, Deathstroke... and everything.",1
339,Justice League have problems with a generic villain and a start a little trouble but Is extremely effective in the presentation and development of this group in a spectacular and Fun way.Justice League is a love letter for DC fans,1
340,"Despite its flaws, it's one of my top 5 entertaining movies in the last years. Great portrayal of the characters, most scenes are really well done and a good twist ( that DC can go lighthearted, as well).",1
341,big fail justice league hahahahahahahahahahahhahaahha syndercult hahhahahahahahahha,0
342,"Dont let the DC fanboys bully you into liking this movie. It is not good, period. I cant imagine why anyone would force themselves to like a poor film. How are you ever going to encourage film makers to make good films if you dont call them out when they fail.",0
343,"Huge disappointment, First batman vs superman now this. 1. Poorly written story2. Predictable plot 3. Joke of a villain,4. very bad attempt at humor5. Bad and unnecessary use of CGI6. BoringZack Snyder is killing DC universe",0
344,"Decent flick, great characters, some gooood action scenes from Snyder, bur rushed because of WB and tough situation regarding the movie. Zack's version would be better",1
345,Critics are either terrible liars or they just didn't bother watching this movie. It is much better than the Avengers to be frank. Zack Snyder saves himself with this film. A great start to stand alone films coming from DC.,1
346,"Not bad, leaps and bounds over Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad but falls incredibly short when it compares to Man of Steel or Wonder Woman. The cast and characters make this movie what it is, to start, from top to bottom, the cast is great and share exceptional chemistry and a sense of unity. Theres alot of exposition and some pretty well shot scenes and action sequences. Its a very entertaining movie, very light-hearted and not as grim and brooding as past DCEU films. My main gripes with the film are definitely the story, its extremely bare, theres no meat when it could have benefited the film and Steppanwolf as a villain leaves much to be desired. The run-time restrictions set by WB and Snyder's inability to coherently tell a story really affect the pacing, many scenes aren't as fleshed out as they need to be. As with many complaints on here, the CGI at times can be very pedestrian, the film also could have benefited from better editing. Like I said, its a very entertaining movie to say the least, the characters and getting a chance to see them come together really make the film a nice ride from start to finish. Again, my thing with these movies is they could benefit from getting Zack Snyder out of the directors chair and away from the creative process, he is too focused on flash and making things look pretty to tell a compelling and even coherent story. While Justice League is no where near as bad as people are making it out to be, my advice for DC and for Warner Brothers is to take Snyder away from the controls, find someone who can tell a coherent story(George Miller, Patty Jenkins, Edgar Wright, Matt Reeves, Gareth Edwards to name a few) as well as take themselves away from the controls and let the film-makers and guys like Geoff Johns do their jobsOverall score: B",1
347,"Good movie, not perfect, but good.  Zack Snyder does some really great stuff to help bring comic books to life.  I liked the villain too.  More work to be done, but fun, and enjoyable in 3D.",1
348,"Don't pay attention to the critic score, those who can't do, critique  solid action scenes, they set out to make a team super hero movie and they did that.Worth the watch.",1
350,"It is a very good movie. I think it is one of the best superhero movies out there. It is that good. How do I come to that conclusion? Well, this is one of the few movies that I hope was longer. Longer! It doesn't drag on. It keeps me glued to the screen. There are times when watching superhero movies that I feel bored. ""Just get to the point,"" I thought. All superhero movies suffer from this in varying degree. BvS was one of the worst, but the avenger movies is pretty close to the top worse offender. Even Thor Ragnarok has some boring moments. Not the Justice League. It goes straight to business. I know much of the background story of most of the characters so that may help. But even for the characters that I don't really know the introduction is sufficient. The Cyborg, for example, has pretty straightforward background story that was clearly explained in the movie efficiently. [SPOILERSS START!!] A Top of the class college boy that had an accident and died. His father miss him so much and just so happen also the scientist working with cryptonian tech. He decided to try and bring him back to live, and it works. [SPOILERSS ENDD!!!] It doesn't give us anymore than needed and it is fine. More story would make the film boring.The main villain is a bit unexplored, and scenes of him can be made better, but I think it takes second place to the excellent relationship building between the characters. They are very different persons that have real reason to band together. And how the relationship develop from cynical strangers to close buddies is believable. And again this is done very efficiently.  This is feel good movie about building friendship first, and superhero movie second, and I'm fine with it.Overall, It is an excellent movie. I would have given it a 9, but I feel it is unfairly treated by the critics, so I give it 10 to balance it out.",1
351,"It's a really cool movie, certainly not worse than 1st Avengers (having over 90% at rotten, LOL). There is a little bit too much action, but the movie is a fun, well-paced spectacle, full of cool interactions between DC's most iconic heroes. Worth a watch!",1
352,terrible terrible movie.... RIP DC and their so called films... MCU just win give up... batman and superman were always boring characters and the rest of JL was just nothing... even worst MCU movie is still ten time better than this.,0
353,"A nail in the coffin for the DCEU. The series was doomed from the start, and it needs a reboot to save it.",0
354,"It's awful!!! The worst superheroic movie I've ever seen! Flas and Cyborg are ridiculous!!!! The ONLY good thing in all the movie - wonder woman, the rest - graphic, plot, antagonist, flash, cyborg - a complete lack of talent...",0
355,"I actually preferred Suicide Squad. At least it had substance that was fun to mock. This felt like a 2 hour version of the trailers. It felt like a movie with no substance at all and by the end, the audience was struggling to care.The Good- The Characters are fun and played decently by the actors.- Some scenes were fun but all were shown in the trailer.- It was short.The Bad- The Plot was rushed and felt like it came out of left field. The pacing was spectacularly bad and I felt bored at several points.- The Villain was worse that Marvel villains, and that's saying something, he was an angry demon thing with no understandable motivation made of horrible looking CGI. Talking of which...- The movie looked horrible. The CG was not good and there was way too much of it. Shout out to Steppenwolf and Cyborg for looking worse than most video games.- Joss Whedon's influence is noticeable and its horrible. The one liners are not only bad but clash with the tone and we've seen the best ones in the trailers.- Return of Superman comes out of nowhere, and both the tone and his character are all over the place.- Character backstory, motivation and archs are rushed, incomplete or non existance. I think I cared less about most characters at the end of this film than at the start.- The Final battle was all of the above: seen it in trailer, was rushed, badly written, out of nowhere, tonally inconsistent and looked awful.- The movie just ends feeling unfinished. (This can also be seen as a positive because I just wanted to leave at that point.)To conclude all fears about this movie being bad because unlike the Avengers it came before most character introductions are founded. Wonderwoman was the only character I cared about and that was only because I liked her movie. They had to cram in both introductions for everyone and a plot into 2 hours and hence do both badly.",0
356,"Went in not expecting much. Walked out with a fun smile on my face. Having the team come together; with new threats on the rise is very exciting. Thanks for a great Justice League, looking forward to more!",1
357,I thought this movie was great. A lot better than the trailers made it look. Woman Woman opening scene set the tone. The CG was subpar in some of the reshoots but who cares it was still awesome and the story was interesting. I think the critics just nitpick the DC movies.,1
358,"I appreciate the work and attention to detail given to this project but once again DC fails to direct a comfortable sequenced movie where aspects are taken with baby steps instead of hitting the wall full force. The transitions of plot devices hit each next scene faster than the flash tripping over his Rubbermaid suit. Steppenwolf brings to the table yet another obvious forgettable and expendable villain masked in 600 layers of CGI and zero attention to character development. The justice league only presents itself as a bunch of halloweeners posing for the picture shot before causing billions in taxpayer money in both the movie and in real life. The actors fit into their roles like a transgender man inside of a woman's bathroom. The over-reliance on showing white people as being villains is sickening, for one, it is ok to be white.   Superman's entire existence in this movie was an eyesore that had me closing my eyes begging time to change the scenes. His brokeback mountain sequences offered nothing to the movie and were clearly filler. There needed to be many things in the movie ripped out. The mastermind that is Zack Snyder comes out in true colors in that he does not communicate enough outside of his property, his diaper fetish is on full display in the details of the characters, sets, crayon drawing plot devices.",0
359,"There is so much slow motion in Justice League I wanted a fast forward button just so it would finally end. The DCEU is a mess. No effort was ever put in to setting up Justice League so it's not surprising it turned out the way it did. A dull story with underdeveloped characters all pieced together by an unforgiving amount of CGI I genuinely feel sorry for anyone who went to see this in 3D. Nolan's Batman trilogy raised the bar and nothing DC has done since has ever come close and Justice League is no exception.Superman is dead, the world is depressed. Batman is trying to gather a team of heroes because Suicide Squad worked out so well. Meanwhile a super evil CGI villain called Steppenwolf wants to collect and combine three evil cubes which will cause the end of the world complete with blue lasers and a whole bunch of other overwhelming CGI effects that will assault your eyes and if you nearly fell asleep reading that take a minute to think about how I felt. A villain so lame, so pointless you'll almost miss Jesse Eisenberg's overacted Lex Luther. Jason Momoa is only there to look pretty with a rushed three minute intro into his character just so he could be in the movie. What a waste. I liked Ezra Miller as the flash but everything he says is a forceful way to get as much comic relief into Justice League in the hope that the humour will distract the audience from everything else. Don't think about the bland and unoriginal story, stop focusing on the video game like effects and certainly don't think about Henry Cavill's CGI removed moustache (psst Snyder, the CGI baby didn't work for Clint Eastwood so it definitely wasn't going to work here) just laugh at the funny movie and forget. The comedy works for Marvel so why not DC too? Gal Gadot was by far the standout performance, yet the leering camera work was weirdly similar to what Joel Schumacher was doing to Poison Ivy in Batman and Robin. So instead of subjecting yourself to this trash just re-watch Wonder Woman again. Although that's far from perfect, put it next to Justice League and you've got a masterpiece.Danny Elfman's score using the original Batman and Superman theme was a nice touch but that's not enough to save Justice League, not even close. There's no life to it, everyone seemed to be going through the motions. I suppose the main cast have all signed multipicture deals so they have to do this but did anyone really want to? It doesn't show at all. Powerfully boring. Not recommended.",0
360,"Maybe my expectations were low, but this movie exceeded my expectations. I kept checking my watch to see how much time was left for them to screw it up. They never did. This movie is better than at least half of the Marvel movies if not 3/4. I feel DC is more criticized than Marvel, BvS had some issues but was pretty solid, where as bombs like Iron Man 3 and Ultron get a free pass. Well, DC did it this time. No doubt. I've heard some complaints about the CGI (I don't really see it as being any worse than Star Wars TFA) and pacing (I actually thought the pacing was fantastic not only in terms of action but the development of characters). I never see movies twice in the theater and I'm considering seeing this one again. Solid. A.",1
361,"It's a grand popcorn movie. Turn off your brain any just enjoy it. Flawed? yes, especially the CGI in parts. Terrible? No. I can say I enjoyed this far more than Age of Ultron at least.",1
362,"ok,i think its a great movie about this story!we waited this about 15 years and ofcause not everything looks like we want,but!at first,i like that not all film was dark, because its team film,i dont think so that it must be full dark! at second,evrybody saw the Whedon's parts, but its not bad!at third,i really like that we didnt see stories about aquaman,ciborg,flash before justice league, but we saw enough for understending for a moment!!at last, humor in this film was cool, everything in its place!",1
363,"JL is a great movie, entertaining, visually impressive and good performances, maybe the post-production work is notorious in the final result but the movie is cool",1
364,"Some bad cgi in parts, but it really did a nice job continuing to establish the DC world that started in bvs. It also has highly engaging and fun personalities. They nailed flash and setup justice league 2 to be even better. Much like the animated series, the characters all have their own unique bonds with one another. The wonderwoman Aquaman scene was hilarious.",1
365,"Muy buena, aun que le falto el factor suspenso. Estuvo genial muy entretenida de principio a fin los personajes se introducen de una manera estupenda para que no tengas que saber mucho de su pasado, esta genial",1
366,"The film is awesome. I really liked the whole team. Actually, I think a lot of scenes were cut and it isn't so good. For example I didn't see a scene with a hologram (where was Supergirl or someone else)that was in the trailer.",1
367,"I was very pleased with what I saw and wonder what ""hot mess"" the other people (Critics) were watching. The movie had a story that was in line with Marvel movies in its story basics. In this film, there was a supervillain one of the new Gods trying to terraform the world and conquer its peoples. The superheroes after a time come together to fight and stop him. Marvel has done that twice in the Avengers and will do it again when Thanos comes to earth. The interaction between the heroes is Marvel's strength and is well done in this movie. The movie was funny and had its dialogue had moments of greatness. The plot worked for me and the risks were real for the heroes against a very powerful villain. The CGI of Steppenwolf may have been not the best but it was adequate and he was a formidable foe for the whole league of superheroes. He was not as much fun as Hela in Thor Ragnarok but just as effective. The dialogue between the characters was fine and was one of the movie's strengths. While the editing of the movie seemed abbreviated at points there was enough background to tell the story. It was an enjoyable fun experience and I am sorry if some critics thought it was painful.",1
368,"A fun movie that definitely shows improvement for the future of the DC Cinematic universe. The heroes and their interactions with each other are by far the best part of the film, and sets up potential future DC movies. Only real problems were that CGI was noticeable a few times, story and villain were fairly lackluster and the music was nowhere close to what it was in previous DC films. The Leaguers themselves are the highlights by far, everyone fit their role perfectly and brought the heroes to life. A massive improvement over BvS and Suicide Squad, but not quite as good as Man of Steel or Wonder Woman for me.",1
369,"Lifelong comic fan of both DC and Marvel.  Zach Snyder has single-handily destroyed this franchise. Slightly less dark and depressing than BvS, but still way too dark and depressing causing the moments of humor to feel forced. Most boring comic villain of all time and poorly cgi rendered.  There is hope, but it relies on ditching Snyder and forgetting these movies exist.",0
370,"It's easy to determine the mark of a critic. If it doesn't have blood, sex and old rock and roll or if it's not a documentary they will hate it. They are as predictable as the movies they love. This is a fun movie, and if you need help to determine if a $10 night out is right for you -- I guess that says a lot about your character or lack thereof.",1
371,"Justice League is a film that fans of DC will definitely enjoy. For those who loved BvS, you will absolutely love this film. If you didn't enjoy BvS, you will be pleasantly surprised. The film does have some flaws however the team interactions and the introduction of new characters was very well done. JL is a good mix of fun and action and an awesome film.",1
372,"I believe that the Justice League movie is good enough but lack of DC, installation due to the large amount of cut scenes are too visible. The film is much better Avengers especially in terms of jokes.",1
373,"This movie is one of the best in this year. It has heart, humor, as well as great chemistry between characters. A must see. Although it's a shift from the style of MOS and BVS, it still has a strong ""theme"" like all DC movies do.",1
374,"Very fun movie with a lot of action. Great Characters, specially Flash, Wonder Woman and Aquaman. But the CGI and the villain are very bad. Don't listen to the critics. See it for yourself",1
375,This is the best superhero movie made to date. Each hero had a good amount of screen time. It emphasized team work and what heroes are. We finally have the perfect Superman.,1
376,"Justice League is everything it should be and also the best DCEU movie today. It has nonstop action, lots of humor, memorable and exciting moments and above all, a great cast that puts together the super hero team!",1
377,"idk whats wrong with these ""critics"" this is the film DC needed and im saying that after **** about this film after watching the trailer and i came with a mindset of hating to no end, but i really enjoyed it.Ben affleck is finally redeeming himself as a great batman wonder woman was just wonderful as she was before jason momoa as aquaman really surprised me.I hated him from the trailers but he was one of my fav.Ray fisher as cyborg did an admirable job.My fav definitely was erza miller aka flash.I liked him more than quicksilver from xmen and cant wait for his own movie if they plan to make one.The antagonist(called steppenwolf) was a bummer and the biggest negative for this film, but that still shouldnt hold you back from watching this film.This is the step in the right direction for DC and ben affleck you ve finally showed us how good you can be, so please don't leave DC",0
378,"Based on the hate this movie was getting in went in very apprehensive about it. I can honsestly say the movie is good, not great but good. One gripe would be the constant attempt of humour with one liners strewn throughout the movie. All the actors fit and suit their comic counterparts. The action and character interaction during the film was good as well. People need to realize that it’s too late to have origin movies made for all the DC characters as Marvel did, that’s why DC is going in head first with this group. Because Steppenwolf isn’t not a well know villain to some general comic fans and general populous,may have hurt the film and the critics understanding of the film. I would say this movie is worth the price of admission and for you to go see it and be a judge for yourself. Lastly I kinda missed the Martian Manhunter J’onn J’onzz being in the film but this is based on the new 52 direction DC is taking.",1
379,Justice League is GREAT!! the characters are awesome I've waited a long time to see The League come together like this on the big screen and it doesn't disappoint. I love this film and I can't wait for the director's cut.,1
380,"A great movie! Best in the DCEU. A wonderful cast, powerful characters, absolutely the whole League is chic. Batman, shooting the parademons, Wonder Woman and Aquamen battling with Steppenwolf, Cyborg with awesome abilities and Flash young, inexperienced but charismatic and positive. The main enemy was not left only at the end of the film, he represents a threat throughout the film. He is powerful, self-confident. Fights like this. as if he saw no threat in the enemies, only toys for whipping.Exceptionally positive emotions)",1
381,"Its a pretty good movie, go see it. It gave each character enough time to get to know them and want to see more of them. Its almost as good as first Avengers movie, though the narrative is pretty simpler (?) and villan is powerful and evil though after they defeat him its forgettable. Visual style stunning to watch, making gifs and rewatching them millions of times will be an immense joy. It looks very good (batman!) and has pretty classic plot for a superhero movie.",1
382,"Fun movie, but has a lot of problems. You will enjoy and worth the ""popcorn"" in theaters, but it's not a ""memorable"" movie. Kind of GENERIC ACTION MOVIE. But its fun, so... :D",1
383,"A superhero movie. Yes, this is how I need to start this critique, why? Well because are the insistent comparisons between MARVEL and DC and this beginning explains exactly where each one differs. DC / Warner does not make movies to please adults and fans, their view, whether you agree or not is that we should rather keep alive the flame of what it is to be a superhero, than it is to be an icon to the world and that's what the new generations needs stories that go far beyond punching, putting visual effects, and linking different comic book characters. Alias ​​exactly this premise causes that they can aesthetically change their heroes because in their core their essences are there and even that this is expanding, these characters who were always dense are still dense but with a lightness that is necessary to inspire a whole new generation and movie theaters are with them, these kids leave with their bright little eyes and they are quiet and concentrated watching the movie and if this is not a sign that they are correct in the formula of heroism, then I do not know what it is this formula.",1
384,"Sure it's a tad short and a CGI fest, but wow, the team members were a thrill to watch. So many cool, geeky moments. It had heart, humor, action, and set up the universe that I'm truly excited to see more of.",1
385,Que filme horrivel!!! Esperei tanto tempo pra ver um filme da Liga da Justiça e os caras fazem uma porcaria dessas. LIXO LIXO LIXO LIXO LIXO LIXO LIXO LIXO,1
386,"I don't like giving a 10 but I cannot find anything wrong with this movie or anything that could have been done better. There is no way this is a 3, if you are proffesional critic and you rated it a 3 perhaps you missed the opportunity in life to start a career in something you're competent at. The CG is great, music is great, tons of quotable lines, the tone is highly serious but it's perfectly paced with comic relief that had the whole theater laughing... I liked it better than the marvel movies. I see nothing wrong with Ben Affleck as Batman, in fact I think he rocked the role despite my initial doubts. IMO they picked the perfect people for each hero.The entire theater clapped at the end. There is no legitimate reason for rating this under an overall green score. I keep reading that there was a lot of bad CGI. I wonder if those people watched it in 3d? 3d is always bad if it wasn't shot in 3d. At any rate I never once thought about the CGI while watching it in 2d.Ignore all the over the top ""hit piece"" articles you see online, it truly is a really great movie and the best I have seen in a very long time.",1
387,"Warning Spoilers aheadMy honest opinions about Justice League MovieJustice League improves from Batman v Superman with a lighter tone and more action. DC is starting to find its footing in their movies. While not as good as Wonder Woman the movie is still a fun ride with plenty of action and jokes. Plus the second after credits scene sets up a very interesting plot line and is a type of story that DC could beat Marvel to.Other reviews have said that the CGI is terrible. The only two bad examples of notice in then film was the very evident airbrushing of Henry Cavill's mustache (which thankfully is only in a couple scenes) and the villian Steppenwolf's face. Not sure why they didn't use a real person for villain as he looked rather human. But that isn't enough to make or break the film.I thought it was a brilliant film and worth a much higher score. Go see it, and stay to the very end for a post-credit scene.My favorite moments were the League Fighting Superman and The Final battle between Steppenwolf and the JL. The 2 post credits scene were just the beginning how big the DCEU is going to be. WHoever is reading this just watch the movie I am sure You'll love it. Warner Bros. Entertainment As always your movie was great. But it should have been a bit longer. Zack Snyder visuals were just great as usual and Whedon's storytelling saved the day.Henry Cavill You ll be my best Superman",1

389,"A long-awaited teaming of some of DCEU’s beloved superheroes that exceeded expectations! Went in with an open mind, came out highly anticipating the follow-up Justice League film! Characters all played off each other ratherly naturally. Really fun seeing them use their superpowers together as a team, with the spotlight on each of them at times as well. I preferred the 3D version even more than the 2D because it clearly was intended for 3D viewing thrills! Forget the nitpicking critics who simply cannot enjoy a film for what it was intended to do, historically unite the DCEU six in a live action adrenalin-pumped thrill ride of a blockbuster movie! SENSATIONAL!",1
390,"I think the movie was great, really like this DC main storyline (watched Batman v Superman extended 3 times already). The Joss Whedon parts might be fun, but some of them is out of place and I REALLY hope, that WB/DC is going to release an extended cut of this, packed with Zack Snyder's original scenes and vision. The CGI was decent as well and I did not find any scenes with Cavill's invisible mustache disturbing. Even the musical scores turned out to be great, though I was afraid when I heard Elfman's tracks on YT first.Recommended",1
391,"While not the saving grace that the DC Universe so desperately needed, I wouldn't call this a flop either. Yes while the villain was atrocious and the writing was about as dull as possible for most of the characters, it still had alot of charm that I didn't expect to see here. I loved Ezra Miller as the Flash and having Cyborg such an integral part of the story caught me off guard in a good way. The DC universe has a LONG way to go to catch Marvel but, for the first time in this franchise, I'm going to disagree with the critics. Justice League was a fun movie to watch and I hope that the rumored Flashpoint spin-off of this takes the universe to a whole new level.",1
392,"The only issues I had with the film are a few editing ones and some CG issues, Especially the faces (removing Cavill's moustache, Steppenwolf's and Cyborg's face). Aside from that, I thought it was a fantastic movie. The cast works great together. Affleck is a bit more comedic in this one, Gadot still plays a typical WW but she's enjoyable, Miller is a great comedic relief as the Flash and Momoa is just a gem as Aquaman. I'm kind of on the fence with Fisher as Cyborg because he's not given much to work with and rumour has it that a lot of Cyborg's story was left on the editing room floor. A lot of Aquaman's story was cut as well. I am glad that Jeremy Irons got a lot more screen time though, He's not appreciated enough as Alfred.What I did like about it is that it's fast-paced, action-packed and while the story is a bit generic, The way the team gets together and fights is where the magic is at. I am a bit disappointed with some of the editing choices. The first two intro scenes involving Superman and Batman should have been cut, There was no reason for them to be in the film. Taking that away and added more to Cyborg's or Aquaman's story would have made it a better investment for both characters. I think fans should have been more than happen to watch another 10-15 minutes of the film to see those characters fleshed out more.Overall though, It's nowhere near as bad as critics make it out to be. Then again, If you don't have Marvel attached to your name you are already in the red.",1
393,"I am a fan of these Superhero movies.  Marvel has taken them and made them fun to see.  They do not take themselves seriously and I think that is the battle when you take over-the-top comic book characters and put them on film.  Zack Snyder landed the prize in getting a contract to run the DC Universe.  It all started with Batman vs Superman, and it seemed to me that DC choose the wrong guy to carry that torch.  Zack wanted us to take these/his superheroes so seriously that we actually got bored.  I could not fathom that the 2 greatest comic book superheroes in one movie could ever make one bored, but Zack did it.  It should have been a no-brainer of a successful flick, but noooo, it was friggin boring.  So instead of DC firing his ass, they gave him another chance and got help from Joss Whedon who had to replace him in the final stages of making the movie.  I am not sure how much credit to give Joss, but it worked.  Justice League is still not Marvel level of enjoyment, but it was a vast improvement over the Bat vs Sup failure.  DC take note of what director Taika Waititi did in Thor: Ragnarok and make that your measuring stick for future movies.  There is hope DC Universe lovers.  Wonder Woman was the start and now Justice League gives us fans hope.  In the end, we all want superhero powers, but the dilemma is could we handle it and would we use it in a selfless manner like these icons in the comic world?  I believe it is this element that brings us to the theater to watch these type of movies.  We live in a troubled time and we all wish we had these superheroes to give the world a better tomorrow.  Justice League is the fantasy we need and want and it is why we pay to see it. Just take your thinking cap off and enjoy the ride.",1
394,"I do not understand why the critics were so hard on this movie. It is funny, it has great action sequences, and the characters were great. Overall, really great movie.",1
395,Goes to show you..Critics sometimes are just plain to..Over critical!! I enjoyed this movie. Was a little reluctant to go see it initially But found it to be quite entertaining. Not many dull moments and the villian was actually quite interesting.,1
396,Next best DC movie after Wonder Woman.I loved it. I don't know why all these critics are complaining. After all its a comic book movie. Flash steals the show!,1
397,"Enjoyable film with great action scenes , some comedy here and there , and a mature audience friendly , thank you . With all the hate it got from the media , I was expecting a weak film , but I had fun watching it.",1
398,"This movie was awesome. Not as good as Thor Ragnarok but still an enjoyable movie. Great action, villain felt powerful for the bulk of the movie and brought reason to the need for a united team to fight him, acting was good, some cool lines. I really don't get why critics gave it such a ridiculously low rating. I hope we see a justice league 2, but maybe with a recasted lex luthor from dawn of justice.",1
399,"This movie is a 7/10. Lets face it, this wasn't the big time justice league movie we've all been waiting for. Instead it barely eeks out a 7 and that's mostly because the action was good. Warning-spoilers follow.Let's start with Batman. If your a Batman fan you are highly disappointed with this Batman in this movie. He pretty much plays the scaredy cat in this movie. Not only that, the Batman I know always looks for ways to get **** done and is always on the move saving the world with or without you as it is apparent in almost every justice league show and comics but here he is assembling the team and trying to get Wonder Woman to lead it. Batman don't take orders from nobody(for the most part) and most definitely ain't going to be wasting time trying to get someone to lead the team. Then there's the fight with parademons in which he struggles to fight and again they go with him taking their guns and using them against them. What's up with this batman and guns.The flash. I'm not sold. I get that he is supposed to provide laughs but all the jokes were practically on the trailers and the jokes in the movie just weren't that funny. I really wish we a little older flash here than this guy.Superman going bad (for a minute). Just stop WB. It's bad enough how ridiculous this scene is when supes fights the justice league but the reason does not make sense. The fight starts with cyborg not being able to control himself and shoots supes and supes retaliates. Since when would Superman go all out and fight like that just to fight yet at the same time this is supposed to be Superman that inspires and brings hope. What a contradiction. Not only that the next time supes talks to cyborg it is like he is ok and his robot part isn't trying to kill supes. In fact they don't even mention or explain that at all. They just used this as an excuse to start a dumb fight that don't make sense.Weak villain. I think everybody is on board with this.Wonder Woman has super speed? There's a scene where she blocks all the bullets from a machine gun by moving incredibly fast which makes me think... ok if your going to give her super speed than why isn't she moving fast all the time. This is the only scene in the movie(or at all) where wonder woman moves this quick. Don't make sense.Now that's the bad out of the way but there is some good. For one was the action was looked pretty good and enjoyable. The way the Batman suit looked was cool and I enjoyed looking at the suit even though I didn't enjoy Batman himself. Of course the amazonians were awesome. Lastly, the last scene with Bruce helping Clark get the house back for his mom, I felt, was really good. Though it was unearned, the way the scene planned out and the way Bruce and Clark were talking to each other at the end... this is the chemistry I would like to see from Batman and Superman similar to the Public Enemy movie and other movies where they show off the chemistry between Superman and Batman.Overall, the movie wasn't trash but it was from how big the movie was supposed to be especially considering that this was the Justice League movie. I would say that if your not dying to see this or already figured that this movie wasn't going to be that great then just wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray, and hopefully the Blu-Ray has some uncut features since apparently a lot of scenes were cut out of the movie. So the Blu-Ray might actually be better than what was shown in theaters if they do this. Other than that I hope this universe gets rebooted already cause, come one, when you only have one movie that was good(Wonder Woman which wasn't that great just good and better than what WB has put out so far) then there's a problem.",1
400,"The movie was a nice setup to how the Justice League came together. The pacing could be better, but that's what you expect from the limited screen time. You don't need to watch other DC movies to understand the concept of Superman dying by Batman's side. The promotions kept a nice little surprise hidden from us. The movie had a great mix of comedy and action. The Flash especially had the best lines, even if it felt like they made him autistic.",1
401,"Criminally underrated. Flawed (lame bad guy, pouty Batman, too much CGI), but generally fun and funny (Flash). Audience loved it -- especially Wonder Woman and Superman.",1
402,"As much as it is a visual spectacle, it lacks a depth of story. For a comic book reader and DC comics characters lover since my early years, I loved how the movie dealt with the justice league members, but apart from that, it felt a little bit rushed.",1
403,Fun popcorn flick. Flash was awesome. Whedon and Elfman saved this film. Get rid of Snyder’s involvement all together to save the DC movie universe.,1
404,"Finally the DC movie fans deserve. Worth the watch for sure, specially for those who like the characters and are hopeful for the future of the DC movies",1
405,What a Blast!!! Everyone was great playing these amazing comic book superheroes.Could'nt believe it was over so fast (Tthat's how action packed it was!).,1
406,"I liked the movie and can say that DC made the turn to the right direction with this movie. The movie brings a right balance between action, story, drama and comedy, and the good moments in this movie far outshine it's flaws.",1
407,I come here after see Star wars: The last jedi. Suddenly Justice League dont seem too bad. Or even Suicide Squad I think is better than the other trash that disney did.,1
409,"Unfortunately JL has too many problems, which make it a complete disaster and a waste of time and money. There are a lot of ridiculous and pointless situations. Wedon's additions are just dialogues and jokes that ridicule characters that should not be ridiculed, like Batman. The biggest culprit of all this is the script (written by Snyder and Terrio). The only good thing was to listen again to the typical song of Batman by Elfman.",0
410,"The most fitting synopsis I've seen to date is that this is a live-action, two-hour long episode of Justice League Unlimited (the Cartoon Network show). If that's your thing, welcome! :)The casting is near-perfect. Gadot, Cavill, and Affleck already have proven themselves as their comic book counterparts. But Momoa, Miller, and Fisher go the extra mile. The Flash is lighthearted enough to remind us of Wally West, but illustrate an extremely young Flash who isn't even a cop yet. Miller gloriously captures the brooding and conflicted young man who wanted to die, and resents his father's decisions while still caring about him. Momoa's Aquaman has phenomenal potential, clearly drawing from the late 90s to mid 2000s gruff, vigilante-style Aquaman. But Momoa keeps both hands.The CGI is no more gratuitous than any fandom-based, big-budget film that relies largely on sci-fi/fantasy elements (looking at you, Pacific Rim, Hobbit Trilogy, Marvel, and Harry Potter), but there are a few scenes that give you pause to wonder why they went with a certain animation. Hardly movie-breaking. Nonetheless, the settings, the varied color palettes, how each environment reflects its hero, the cinematography, and the rich score make this movie so vibrant, it should be difficult for anyone to criticize that aspect.While I imagine many folks wanted more from a villain, that was never Steppenwolf's obligation, nor the purpose of the film. The film itself is about the League coming together. The League fighting. And the League lighting a path to a new era of hope; the Snyder loyal will argue this was the plan all along: construct a conflicted world that has no shortage of pain, despair, and mistrust. And I would agree with them. Even with slight inconsistencies from Whedon to Snyder scenes, this film and its lore seem thoroughly fleshed-out.Steppenwolf is a lackey. Darkseid will come one day, and the world will tremble. Until then, who knows? Starro? Amazo? Grodd? We'll see.Stay until after the credits.I give it, flaws and all, an 8.5/10. I found it similarly enjoyable to the Avengers. I would've likely given it a higher rating if there were more content.",1
411,"A good time even if rushed and a bit choppy. I really enjoyed the second half where everything comes together. All our heros are perfectly cast. The villain is very menacing,and unlike the critics, I think he's great.",1
412,"Fun movie.  Had an absolute blast watching this film. In my theater people were laughing and cheering, and when Superman reurned clapping. Fun ride. Judge for yourself, and forget eh critics.",1
413,"Justice League is another bad DC Extended Universe movie.In 2018 DC are still trying to catch up with the juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Instead of taking their time to properly build their cinematic universe, DC act like mad dogs. They try to compete with Marvel on the same grounds but their films are utter garbage (the only exception so far being the great Wonder Woman film). Justice League is no exception to the rule.DC know they are far behind Marvel and yet they release an Avengers-like movie before even having introduced half of its super hero protagonists in solo films. This leads to a chaotic mess of a plot where 6 unrelated heroes hastily unite  to combat a super villain before even getting to know each other in the first place.Not everything is that bad, though. There are a few funny scenes involving Superman and Flash who antagonize over who is the fastest of the two. They offer a couple of good laughs, but they can't save this disaster of a movie.At least Justice League is better than Suicide Squad, but it's on par with Batman vs Superman. Which isn't a compliment.",0
414,"Critics are absolutely wrong on this one.I thought it was very enjoyable and could have gone on longer actually, I still wanted more by the end. The great: - It is happy to be it's own film, whereas some big movies coming out now try to tick all the boxes of cliches and stick strictly to a commercial formula.- Great chemistry between the leads and the screen time was naturally balanced well between them. Unlike some of the marvel films, Civil War especially, where it is a constant, grating competition to equally show everyone being impressive.- Superman scenes were some of the best in the film. - Aquaman is portrayed fantastically here and was the most likable superhero we have seen on screen in a long time.  The average: - Villain could've been more threatening and tougher to take down - While the Flash was funny, maybe they could have cut down on some of his jokes to give a slightly more serious characterization Overall: Great experience. The critics are way off here. It's not perfect but is still a great comic book film and well worth watching in the cinema.",1
415,"First let me get this out of the way: I was SUPER excited for this movie. I am a huge DC fan, and when I found out that my favorite superhero team was finally getting their chance on the big screen, I nearly fainted from excitement.That being said, the movie is not perfect. It had some obvious flaws that, if mended, would have made the movie practically perfect. But damn, is this movie KICK-ASS!I honestly don't know for the life of me what all these harsh critics are griping about. Whether they are biased or just being overly harsh for the sake of being overly harsh, one thing I am sure of is that I don't agree with them at all.Let's start with the flaws and errors in the movie. First of all, it was too short. As we all know, over 20 minutes of scenes were cut from the movie by WB, and I feel like that was really unnecessary. Moving on, I wasn't that crazy about the CGI. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was ""abysmal"" or ""the worst ever in any movie"" like many other reviewers but rest assured it could definitely use some work. Also, I'm kind of mixed about the way that Superman comes back to life. I would have expected him to be evil or insane for a longer time, and even don the Black Superman suit from the comics (Henry Cavill even posted a picture of the suit on social media, so its being a no-show in the movie was a downer). Instead, he just returns to normal after ten minutes. My final conflict with this otherwise awesome movie is this: It appeals more to the comic-fan-audience than the casual-movie-goer-audience. What I mean by this is that if you are not a comic book fan and/or have not seen the previous DCEU installments, you might be a bit confused by some of the happenings in the movie.. Don't get me wrong, there is still a great chance that casual movie watchers will enjoy the movie, but still I wager the casual acceptance could improve a fair bit.That's pretty much all that I saw wrong in the movie, so now for the good stuff. First of all, the chemistry between between the protagonists and the protagonists in general is amazing. They have some great moments, both in terms of banter and working together to fight the Parademons. Each hero (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg) gets a chance to shine and show off their powers and abilities (both alone and working together), which was my foremost expectation in this movie. Needless to say, it exceeds that expectation greatly. In addition, Snyder and Whedon do a bang-up job of balancing out the humor and seriousness in this movie. It's never good to have a movie consist mostly of darkness and cynical toning (cough cough, Batman v Superman, cough cough) OR to have a movie consist mostly of humor and cheerfulness without any good dynamic (cough cough, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, cough cough). Excellent work on that front.Story and plot is mostly good, nothing to be too crazy about but still all right.So, to summarize, Justice League is a great movie that exceeds many personal expectations. My overall rating for it is a 9/10, pretty solid. I highly implore anyone who hasn't seen it and/or is deliberately refraining from seeing it just because of the somewhat unfavorable critic reviews to disregard all that and see it, because I promise you that your money will not be wasted. And if you are a comic book fan like me, it is nearly guaranteed that you will like this movie.",1
416,Absolutely terrible!! Starred Fatman not Batman!Superman was overpowered and there is a lack of enemies as they are all the same. The cgi on Steppenwolf was absolutely terrible and took you out of the movie. It broke immersion and made you feel like you were watching a video game. It tried to copy the Marvel formula and failed. I had just watched Ragnorak and laughed my butt off at the jokes in that. All the jokes in this fell flat.They shouldn't make another one!! The original Batman and the Nolan movies are just better movies. They get Batman right.,0
417,"This is a set up movie.  The story is very well done it is a great job introducing cyborg, Aquaman, the new movie flash, and trying play of a **** story line in batman vs superman.  The setup is there with the L.O.D and the Hall of Justice.  Slade Wilson looks amazing.  The throwback to the cartoon for Cyborg was a nice touch.  Steppenwolf is a nice set up to Darkside(3ed movie I hope).  It is just a really fun movie just go and watch it and turn your brain off.",1
418,"As a comic book reader I was fine with this movie. I understand that some comic book material doesn't translate well to big screen. Of course somethings could have been better and I truly believe that this is a step in the right direction for DC. I dig both Marvel and DC properties, but Steppenwolf wasn't that bad of a villain actually I liked him better then Ultron.",1
419,"Not the DCEU's best movie, but it's definitely that step in the right direction they thought they were taking with Suicide Squad. Wonder Woman is definitely the glue that holds this universe together, but there's enough in this movie that has me excited for what comes next.",1
420,"Justice league was not the best movie I ever saw, but it sure is damn great. The team does good working together, and the villain was, well, id note it under OK. It was also hilarious, unlike Batman vs Superman. It also was short, which was another tiny flaw.",1
421,"I echo the sentiments of those who ask ""What movie did the critics see""? Cause it surely wasn't this one. I saw ""The Avengers"" again and have to say I saw practically no difference in either movie. And to those who say I should've skipped this one, I'm letting everyone know to GO and see this and form your own opinion.",1

424,While I won't say that Justice League was great but it's is not horrible given DC's current track record of horrible movies such as Suicide Squad. With Wonder Woman and now Justice League DC seems to be turning around. Gal Gadot aka Wonder Woman is the breakout star while Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck are supporters. As for the other Justice Leaguers they were great especially Jason Momoa and Ezra Miller. I really liked Jason cause he is a good action hero as Dwayne Johnson. The only weak spot is the villain Steppenwolf. He has no personality and no presence.,1
426,"Yeah, it has flaws, yeah the CGI looks terrible sometimes and yes the villain isn't quite memorable. But you know what? It doesn't take away from the fun. And I think that was BvS's primal problem; it was clustered with all sorts of unnecessary details and the audience felt overwhelmed. Not that this doesn't do that...but it does it in insignificant quantity.It does feel rushed,to be honest, by the start of the third act I was surprised how fast they got there. But there's one thing that helps this movie and that is the chemistry between the characters. It works great, better than expected even. Ok-ish individual moments and overall nice bits and pieces that construct believable characters.I'll end by saying it's a step in the right direction for DCEU. ""Justice League"" isn't what we deserve, but it's better than we expected.",1
427,"the truth the movie started well but i feel that they have abused a lot of special effects and that in my opinion the quality is low in the movie, the characters sometimes are very simple and do not stand out.",1
428,"It's a very fast movie, but it's still an interesting movie. The villain really is not good, the cast is talented and charismatic, but even with all that, the movie deserved to be much better.",1
429,"Justice League surprised me. I did not expect the film to be that enjoyable. It has issues, but there are very bright moments in the film that had me smiling. A great popcorn and coke film and for my fellow DC comic book fans, you won't be disappointed.",1
430,"Way better than I expected it to be. I'm not a Marvel nor a DC fanboy I am  just a movie fan. And all I wanted this movie to do is entertain me and it certainly did just that. Was packed full of action with just the right amount of comedic moments to keep you laughing now and then. The Flash was the surprise for me he was the best in the movie in my opinion, played greatly by Ezra miller. He provided many comedic moments and lots of memorable lines. Movie was a little predictable at parts and slow at times but still very enjoyable. A shorter than expected run time of this movie was a little shocking but to me felt just long enough. Was defiantly surprised by this and was glad that it was so good.",1
431,The movie is not bad at all. It is not a revolution and it doesn ´t deserve a prize for originality but it is entertaining. Low critic ratings are really strange. From my point of view it would be fait to rate it at least like the Avengers movies.,1

433,Finally a good DC movie. It was exciting from start to finish and i recommend it to everyone i know. Life is to short to miss this for once good DC movie. see it today!,1
434,"First off, go see this film. It's fun, has just the right amount of action and the right times and is your childhood heroes brought to life. I waited a week because some of the comments made about bad CGI and a weak villain. Let me tell you, those comments are either made from Marvel fanboys or people who were just looking for something to hate. The villain is probably one of the strongest villains I've seen in ANY superhero flick. He doesn't order a bunch on lackeys around only to finally get his hands dirty at the end nor does he tell the heroes his entire plan. Anyway, go see it. Better than 2/3rds of the superhero flicks made by Marvel or DC.",1
435,"I THINK DC and Warner Bros have finally figured out this superhero movie thing — and not a moment too soon, either.The latest chapter in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) series, Justice League, is a welcome sign that the franchise finally knows where it’s going.Following on from the events of Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Wonder Woman, Justice League sees a new threat preparing to devastate the Earth, a Steppenwolf — no, not the band, more of an alien/demi-god/interdimensional bad guy kinda deal. It pays not to think too hard.Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciaran Hinds) is trying to find and reunite three mystical boxes, in order to unleash some sort of all-powerful force that will allow him to dominate the entire world.Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) are aware of the danger, but know they can’t stop him alone, so Batman enacts his back-up plan: assembling a team of gifted individuals who might be able to help.He enlists Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller) and Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher), the beginnings of the Justice League.Despite their differences, the league of heroes must work together to stop Steppenwolf.Yeah, so that all sounds like a very basic, cookie-cutter plot, doesn’t it? And, quite frankly, that’s as it should be.Batman v Superman took a reasonably simple idea and turned it into a plot so overwrought and convoluted that it no longer made sense and was no longer fun.Justice League has a bad guy who needs to be stopped. The good guys get together to stop him. Simple.And we really do get to see plenty of costumed hero action in this one, as well as some strong character development and interactions among the ensemble cast (I smell a bit of Joss Whedon’s influence here).I finally enjoyed watching Batman. Affleck is wonderful in the role (yes, I was wrong when I said he wouldn’t be, we all make mistakes), and Justice League finally gives him the scope to just BE the Batman.",1
436,"This movie is a mess. The plot is convoluted. The CGI is bad. The villain is terrible. There is very little to like about this movie. Yet, with that, it is still way better than Batman versus Superman. Almost every character has a fun moment. There are laughs to be had and it is still fun to finally see all these characters on the screen together. Superman's return is a bit confusing and is a major reason for the confusing plot. Characters seem to have information just to move the plot along. It is also short... I think it could have benefited from a longer run time. The final battle is boring and predictable. Overall, I would say there is a lot more bad than good. I would skip out on this film.",0
437,"Seen it in Italy, Day 19. I'll be short, the question I liked to answer: Yes. Ask the question it's perfect: No, this is a choral movie like they have not seen for a long time, everything runs smooth even if some cut is obvious. There are very deep characters and in-depth little characters. Barry Allen seems to look like Wally West but, but it does work. There is a wonderful Diana Prince as always since Wonder Wooman (2017), in fact there is also Victor Stone aka Cyborg character I did not believe because of CGI and for the fact that it has just been introduced, in fact he like all the other characters, even in my opinion even more than the other characters, is a supporting column of the whole plot. There are Bat and Superman similar to BvS, very obscure, very good. And finally there is Arthur C. alias Acquaman, this character really works and opens a new world, as WW opens that of the Amazons Acquaman opens that of the Atlanteans, which belongs to the splendid sister A.E. I must admit that this movie has a lighter tone at BvS. I like it.",1
438,"A Joyful ride, really entertaining. As the geek that I am, there were moments that I was jumping on my seat like the kid in front of me. The CGI could have been better in some parts.. But in conclusion this movie is near perfect, and far from a disaster.",1
439,"The story is simplified, fun and all DC fans can enjoy itThe cast is very solidI'd prefer Gal Gadot and Ezra Miller's actCan't wait for the sequel",1
440,"I dont know why ragnarok is review by critics higher than this movie. They both are essenstially the same, bit serious, bit comedy and in the end quite fun. I liked both of them the same. Must watch for fans and and casuals alike",1
441,"This is a wonderful movie; just because you like a song, the way it is, the shape it has (Marvel) is not a reason to say that the others are bad; this movie and DC has they own way to do movies and that its okay, i really enjoy and recomended, its a movie that show the superheroes that you always wanted to see together.",1
442,"It was a good movie, it had humor and action. The reviews aren't doing justice to this movie, it is a good superhero movie. WB just need to stop micromanaging everything!",1
444,"Justice League is the movie the critics got wrong. Before I get started with my gripes about the critics I will simply state this movie as a whole is simply good. Justice League is a entertaining movie with flaws, simple as that. What I enjoyed about the movie was the heart and the league members. Flash, to me and many people I've talked to, was my favorite character. He shows that he is still a novice hero with quirks and humor to balance out the league's varied characters. Batman is still the stoic hero but he has since evolved from BvS from a man without purpose anymore full of rage to a man driven to right his wrongs and save the world again. Wonder Woman is a little under developed but she has lines in this movie that are great and the action scenes with her are splendid. Both Cyborg and Aquaman are great supporting characters, both introduced to us with succinct backstories and excellent fight sequences. Superman's resurrection may have been somewhat anti-climactic but when he returns the movie's action sequences (and humor) is brought up a notch. This Superman is the closest Superman that most people are familiar with. The movie is not without flaws, however. Steppenwolf's character, unlike our heroes, is underdeveloped. He does have a few scenes where he demonstrates his strength but I find that the re-introduction of Superman nullifies his strength and made him far too weak of a villain (on par with Ares and Enchantress so far in DCEU). The story is still a bit discombobulated but after a 2nd viewing it flowed a bit better. And lastly, the CG was good as a whole but there were moments where you can notice flaws in the CG such as the notorious Superstache in the opening sequence. All in all, this movie does not deserve the flack that the critics have given. In the end, Justice League is an entertaining ride from start to finish with heart, humor, and gravity. Easily an 7.5/10 in my book but since I cannot rate it a 7.5/10 it will be bumped to an 8/10 here.",1
445,"This movie is one of te funniest movies I have ever seen in theatres! It is a great combination of action, comedy and drama! I don't know why people expect a lot of this kind of movie! For Crist sake, Zack Snyder did this movie! HALOOO! He is not known for good movies, but I was kind of surprised when i saw it! To sum up, it was fun, Batman was funny, Aquaman was funny, Superman was funny, but the most entertaining character was The Flash! He actually carried the whole movie! Although, Diana was 'mother' of the movie, she didn't carry the movie like Flash did!",1
446,DC got a bad reputation and Marvel is doing great we all know this but i belive because of this DC got stucked with bad reputation and people who go to a DC movie is very prejudiced (critics) included.JL has it problems it's true especially on pacing.Some parts of the story is not developed properly but on JL we finally see some course correction.It is more lighthearted than previous DC films and it suits to tone since Batman is moved by Superman's sacrifice and world needs hope again.Villain is weak and underdeveloped but we know superhero movies usually fail to deliver a great villain.So i am going easy on this part.Production quality is great though except RED CGI background in the finale.Fights scene are superb and we get some awesome battles bettwen our heroes.Movie proves that casting choses were right but they needed more time to develop.JL is a fun movie it has problems yes! but i think JL is the most enjoyable DC movie yet because it lightens the universe's tone and feel.,1
447,"The movie was great. However too many parts of the movie was skipped and also they portrayed batman so weak. DC has great stories , the comic books of DC are so great. I know that after a box office disappointment of this movie DC or WB is not going to introduce Justice League 2 before 2020 and maybe I have to wait many years to see DARKSEID.",1
448,"Criticos falaram tão mal e só viram as coisas ruins e simplesmente ignoraram todo o resto, mais ridiculo é o povo que ler a critica e nem vai assistir o filme pra tira a propria conclusão, até pq que ler a critica? tudo bem, mas assiste o filme pra ter a propria opinião e não seja um manipulado de merda que chama o filme de ruim só porque os criticos deram nota ruim, vejo que esses criticos todos são comprados da Marvel ou são muito a favor de tudo que a Marvel faz, basta presta atenção, Marvel faz um filme eles só dizem as coisas boas e nem prestam atenção nas ruins, mas quando é a DC que faz eles vão logo no error do filme e não ligam pra mais nada, ou seja, é ou não uma clara diferença no tipo de julgamento? claramente os criticos tão favorecedo os filmes da Marvel e só falam mal dos da DC e obvio a critica sendo ruim faz o povo que se influencia por ela nem ir no cinema assistir pra tira a propria conclusão, povo burro, o filme é muito bom e praticamente tudo que os criticos falaram não é verdade, chega a se ridiculo de tanta merda que falaram, mas o filme é mega bom.",1
449,"A great episode of Justice League Unlimited. Felt like seeing the animated series. And this is great. For a universe that don´t had time to evolve properly, thanks to Warner, its a great super hero movie.",1
450,"Zack Snyder's Justice League is a film that once again has DC fans divided. I think its a fantastic film. I liked the mix of a darker tone with humor. The team had a great relationship with each other and they didn't always get along, which shows their ideological differences. My favorite characters were Ezra Miller's Flash and, surprisingly, Ray Fisher's Cyborg. My problems with the film were the villain, the fact that the studio cut down the runtime, and some of the CGI looked a little unfinished. Overall, I love this film. My rating would be a 9.2/10",1
451,"IT is a step in the right direction, but still a very flawed movie, that suffers from over production. The CGI at times is really good, but there are parts that are so bad you would have thought this was a movie from the early 90's. The character development for the newbies Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg is good, but we were left a bit wanting for more. Superman was more like Christopher Reeve like but the CGI stach was to hard to look past. Wonder woman was Wonder woman and Batman was okay but felt out of his depth, some that never happens in any of the comics or animations. Overall I enjoyed the movie and will be expecting more to hopefully push the series forward, even with a soft reboot after Flashpoint. The one thing I wouldn't want is a total reboot as I like some of the casting and I think they can really develop into there roles more in future films.",1
452,"Worth DC movie ever, so far...I want to recover my 2 hours wasted watching very bad fan service",0
453,"Despite the fantastical CGI showpieces, I really can't give anything to this  movie on basis of that. For Marvel surely has done better in that department and still manage to resemble bare-minimum and average act story-lines in their movies.Justice League does try to do what Avengers had to with 5 to 6 prep origin movies and much more prolonged and sustained storytelling which they knew has a future beyond the today and immediate box office. JL hurries through characters, their intros, their dialogues, camaraderie and the cast doesn't even look comfortable. Ben Affleck seemed a grizzly sort of fine before but now, he's just bland and without even a proper thing or two to say. Ezra Miller has an acceptably enjoyable quirkiness that could be associated with a very young Barry Allen but that's that; he's no quicksilver from X-Men Future of The Past irrespective of the speed matching debate. And Cyborg, well that character was simply unnecessary beyond the point of ticking some sort of checklist. The only saving grace is Gal Gadot's existence as Wonder Woman and Aquaman's (I hope they don't ruin the legacy of machismo that is Jason Momoa) Ode to her. Lastly, Steppenwolf is a straw-man baddie that could be anyone, possibly even the dark master Darkseid himself.Justice League is obvious failure of an overcooked hotch-potch that Zack Snyder (He had personal problems during that period) and Joss Whedon (perhaps, his sneaky feminist ally act kept him busy,, hmmm...) indulged in DC's corporate kerfuffling.",0
455,"It's the simplest superhero story that you could possibly tell, and the movie fails to do even that. Every single scene has a plot hole. The villain is terribly written and the CGI on him is garbage. I endlessly enjoyed its everlasting stupidity.",0

465,"If you are a big fan of DC comics or fan of Batman, you will be seriously disappointed. They don't have harmony. They just fight. In Avengers, they had harmony, and each character did their job as a team member. In Justice League, everything was all about power, so Batgod just became Battrash. It was even worse than Dawn of Justice. I was fan of Batman and Ben's apple face, I started to hate WB.DC had lost hope. I will wait until Steven Spielberg creates a shine of hope an I will wait until finally Christopher Nolan creates new Batman movie with Hans Zimmer.",0

Those that rate such types of movies negative are the same posters, commentators and wikipedians that spread ******** in our culture using the internet. They have in real life a sadism second to none, they have very deep ultra sadistic schizophrenic cramps which make me happy to know that whenever they see a damn good movie, their sadistic cramps trigger in with schizophrenic noise creation as life and earth may not be ethical or good, not to mention the production of any good quality superheroes with values etc. This all collides and boosts the schizophrenic sadistic cramps of such ""critics"" until one day a key movie element is created in which hopefully their sadism turns against themselves, smashing their heads against walls, before they can write a review and rate it...

Superman, BvS, Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman and now Justice League.  All excellent movies.",1

Muy recomendable.",1

482,"Justice League was very entertaining. The pacing was on point, there was never really a dull moment, the characters don't require an immediate origin story for you to really like them. The humor was on point and didn't feel forced like some movies do. If you are a fan of comics you will enjoy this movie quite a bit. It has plenty of easter eggs and tidbits alluding to other characters in the DC universe, yet if you know nothing of DC this movie stands alone very well. The CGI/backstory could have been better for Steppenwolf, but wasn't terrible, the characters really carry this movie. Cyborg was much cooler than I anticipated. Be sure to stay for the end credit scenes.",1
486,"Again a DC-universe movie I liked much better than professional reviewers.  I dreaded seeing this after Thor Ragnarok was so good about--nothing.  Justice League engaged me in herding interesting cats into a workable team.  I liked each hero and learned something about each one.  Henry has never looked better as Supe.  Flash as a Jewish kid on the autism spectrum is simply wonderful.  His obvious use as comic relief did NOT reduce him as a character for me.  Gal Gadot's smile remains extremely healing.  Aquaman is a far cry from the orange-scale-suited nice guy of the 1950s.  Bruce Wayne's self-sacrifice was played up convincingly for me.  I think as good as many of the Marvel films and maybe better than  the first Avengers film; as, more focus on character.",1
493,"Justice League was better than it had any right to be, Cyborg, Flash & Aquaman, all cheesy beyond belief, but somehow they pulled it all together rather nicely.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.",1
494,"JL is a massive step down for the DCEU, it is a pretty enjoyable movie, sure, it's also a better movie than Suicide Squad, but it takes the universe to a route that is honestly f*ckin sad, by trying to recreate the marvel formula .Snyder (wether you like him or not) was taking the DCEU to a different path, he wasn't just recreating Fox's, Sony's or Disney's universe, he was creating more experimental superhero films ( if compared to the current releases, of course), sometimes it didn't work, they **** up Batman's character in BvS by taking his detective skills and making him a remorseless killer and, i honestly think MoS is overall an fine average film with nothing to special about it (except the soundtrack, Hanz Zimmer is a god), but when it worked, it was honestly pretty terrific, providing us amazing moments and action sequences that we don't se in those marvel flicks today.unfortunately, WB wanted a more safe approach, so they got Joss F*cking Whedon to finish the movie after Snyder's family tragedy, Whedon reshoot to much stuff, lots of ""funny"" moments were added to the films and the more serious tone that was present in the other Snyder films is completely gone.Taking all that out of the way, the film is fine, it's fun overall and has some pretty good moments, they get almost all of the characters right, but it just feels like a another generic superhero movie, it's no better than Ant man, and that is such a sad thing to say, the best characters from comics history finally unite at the big screen, and in the end it just turns out to be a fun, average movie.",1
496,"After the disappointing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Justice League is a fairly good superhero movie.It doesn't use too much time setting up a massive plot (a trap that other superhero movies have fallen into); rather, Justice League gets into the action fairly quickly. In this way, it feels like a more streamlined and therefore enjoyable experience. Gadot, Miller, and Cavill's performances as Wonder Woman, The Flash, and Superman shine here.I found the villain to be underdeveloped and too easily defeated. Justice League doesn't quite reach the heights of Avengers, but it's still a superhero film worth viewing.",1
499,"Los sucesos de la película avanzan muy rápido y eso no me gustó, no me gusta como se forma el equipo, parece que no tenían ganas de pensar en algo desarrollado. Las interacciones entre los personajes es genial, cada miembro de la Liga se lucieron y me encanto como los manejaron. Aquaman y Flash son asombrosos. El villano bastante cutre como nos tiene acostumbrado DC. La película como está ahora es buena pero sin duda estoy ansioso por ver las escenas eliminadas.",1
500,I dont get why there is so low critics score. The movie is definitely not 10 out of 10 but it is a good movie. Especially I enjoy the characters personality and how they interact with each other. The athmosphere is great. It is not so fun and ease as it was in the last Thor movie for example and in the same time it is not so dark like in BatvsSup.,1
501,"all of the critics i follow gave it a thumbs upi.e Chris Stuckmann gave it a B-Jeremy jahns said it was a fun time no alcohol requiredIMDB gave is a 7.2/10 and it's stayed that way for a month,IGN gave it a 7 and most of the audiences liked i think this criticism i am hearing are only from some uptight sell out critics who feel necessary to blow the smallest flaw out of proportion and give it a negative score , WATCH AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELF is all i have to say",1
502,"I'm not into writing reviews but after my need to express my anger for what they did to Star Wars, I thought I'd take the chance to write a couple more about controversial movies that I like.Yes, you may call me shallow or empty but I'm into comics and Star Wars and Game of Thrones and all those fandoms you may have heard of. And well, I remember recently reading how critics were despising Justice League as a bad movie and another bad installment for the saga.Yes, the same critics that now applaud the ""piece of junk"" that the so-called genius Rian Johnson filmed called The Last Jedi. The same critics that say Thor Ragnarok is a masterpiece.Well, I won't hint what many people think regarding their professional opinions and will limit myself to saying I really enjoyed Justice League.After suffering with how Zack Snyder deconstructed Superman (pretty much what Rian Johnson is doing with Luke Skywalker), I had very low expectations for this film but surprisingly, it turned out to be quite the opposite of what I read in the critics reviews.I won't spoil the fim and will just say it's got its flaws and subplots you may not enjoy but overall it's a very nice and decent movie based on comics. You can actually imagine the movie as emerging from the frames of a comicbook and that means it's accomplishing its main goal.",1
504,Justice League was a massive disappointment considering that it was DC's first team up film. The humor feels forced. The story is boring with an unmemorable villain. The characters are uninspiring. The CGI is bad (particularly in the final act). This was a massive letdown.,0
507,You can almost touch the greenscreen in some scenes. It's not a bad movie but it's a bore and that's the worst thing a movie can be.,0
510,"Despite the many things wrong with the film, it is still enjoyable thanks to Wonder Woman and Aquaman as well as the great CGI.",1
511,"The CGI is a joke but the sory is even worse. It's a mashup of my childhood heroes (I only read DC comics) but there is no chemistry between them. Next time (I hope there will not be a next time) please search for a more creative word then ""box""...",0
513,"Accurate comic come to big screen. Action wise perfect. Simple story without too messy. Villian the weak link, but not stray form the plot. Easy watchable movie.",1
515,"Après un étonnant et même bon Batman vs Superman, ce Justice League est une douche glacée... l'ersatz d'histoire a été confié à un ou plusieurs stagiaires (?) et Zack Snyder a été chargé de meubler d'effets spéciaux ce merdier pendant deux plombes. Bonjour les dégâts !Donc, on a un encorné super-vénère qui ressemble à rien mais super-rageux, sans doute parce qu'il a les cornes (cornuto en italien) et que du coup, il veut tout casser ; et on a notre équipe de justiciers en collants de plastique qui va s'y coller. Superman a un coup de mou mais il va (re)venir faire un coucou plus tard... c'est d 'ailleurs la seul scène intéressante du film à dire vrai.Car le film est bien mou, bavard et bien mal dialogué, bien mal écrit aussi (c'est le stagiaire, on vous dit). Et les tacherons de seconde zone sont venus prêter main forte comme la guirlande ambulante en armure, le très gai Flash et Aqua Velva le barbu glouglou. Heureusement que Wonderbra est là, toujours aussi gracieuse mais bon... ça reste pas bon.Malgré quelques ralentis, la mise en scène n'est pas terrible et aligne surtout les ""boums-boums"" et les étincelles. Et les explosions. Je mets 2 quand même, ce n'est que justice...",0
516,"WOW!! ""The Room"", ""Birdemic"", Neil Breen's ""Fateful Findings"", and now...Justice League. It's awesome to watch such a big budget production fail so miserably on almost everything, only with the exception of one or good 2 scenes, and Ben Afflect's acting (which gave Batman some depth)...However, no clear story structure, shallow character development, and the worst CGI imaginable really give this turd a beautiful spin. It was like watching Blue's Clues level of backdrop artwork. I could go on and on about other beautifully bad details (like the editing) but what made this movie even funnier was the comically shallow and underdeveloped villain Captain StepenBadGuyWolf; just an amazingly weak character that does bad things because the script says he's supposed to. I totally recommend this laugh-out-loud comedy for its genuine attempt to be an EPIC movie and failing with the same level of EPICNESS. -5/5",0
517,"Justice LeagueTellement attendu par certains amis que je ne pouvais le rater.Un humour qui ressemble à Marvel en moins lourd c'est déjà un bon pointDe très beaux effets visuels! J'avoue que quand j'ai regardé les bandes-annonces j'ai eu peur, mais après avoir vu le film je suis satisfait.Moins coloré, plus sombre tourné sur le rouge et le noir parsemé de bleu cela donne un style particulier qu'on peut apprécié comme le contraire.J'ai vraiment adoré le clin d'oeil [spoiler]    à X-Men #FlashEpee et Flash est vraiment stylé    [/spoiler]    Les personnages sont intéressants j'attends leurs films dédiés avec impatience [spoiler]    La scène qui ma le plus marqué c'est flash VS Superman la puissance des coups est extrêmement bien rendue et la vitesse est impressionnante c'est chouette    [/spoiler]    La scène de fin m’a déçu.. Moins de combats en équipe, des personnes pas vraiment visibles a l'écran.. Oui il parait que la scène de fin est dans une ville peuplée moi je pensai qu'il n'y avait personne... C'est étonnant quand avec Avenger 1 on avait New York qui fourmillait de vie..On verra le prochainLa musique est oubliable, les thèmes de personnage sont posés et on s'en rappelleVu en 3D certaine scène sont intéressante c'est plus pour le style, car le fait que le  film soit sombre n'aide pas la profondeur surtout dans la scène d'introduction avec Batman qui mon fait pensé a Batman Arkam Asylum et Arkam City 2 jeux qui reste sombre et d'une grande qualité. J'ai aimé cette scène  sauf la 3DCe n'est pas le film de l'année, mais il a au moins le mérite de faire en sorte de ne pas laisser seul Disney sur ce secteur #SuperHeroPour les enfants ça peut passer",1
519,"Wonder Woman was okay, but here we go again.Justice League is a mess. It has ok characters, ok humor but also horrble action scenes with horrendous CGI effects, tons of unintentional hilarity, bad editing, uneven pacing, and probably one of the worst villians from any superhero movie EVER.",0
523,"Having seen it months after the theatrical release, and after hearing all of the criticism directed towards Justice League, I was expecting a Battlefield Earth-level disaster.  What I got instead was a perfectly serviceable superhero movie. It certainly wasn't as good as The '78 Superman, Spider-Man 2, or Logan. But it wasn't Fantastic Four or Thor: Dark World bad either.  Yeah, the villain was underwhelming, but so was Ares in Wonder Woman, and fire armor dude in Thor, whomever the bad guys were in The Avengers. I am surprised no one in the movie mentioned the band that shares the antagonist's name. Yeah, I know the mythological character came first, but every time they said his name in the movie I started singing Born to the Wild in my head. Someone should've just made the obvious quip and be done with it - they certainly wore out the ""Aquaman's power is talking to fish"" thing.Additionally, Supes wasn't given nearly enough screen time.  I still don't get why he was temporarily bad, but whatever.  And the CGI-removed mustache was jarringly distracting (Hollywood, please stop with the bad facial CGI). But other than that, I'm not sure what exactly people were expecting. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman continues to be both charming and kickass.  The Nordic surfer dude approach to Aquaman is great.  Cyborg's CGI wasn't nearly as bad as I feared, and was a compelling character, as was Flash.  Still not sold on Affleck's Batman, but I do like the way they portrayed him as being way out of his league (no pun intended) compared to the others with actual super powers.Bottom line, all superhero movies - with one or two exceptions - are the definition of popcorn flicks. Mindless fluff that entertains you for a couple of hours. For me, Justice League was as enjoyable as any other superhero movie to come down the pike in the past several years. And *FAR* better than some other blockbusters that came out last year.... like that one... you know... in space. With the battles.",1
524,"After watching Infinity War and can assure that Justice League has so much heart and truth than the Marvel one.  But hey, the bots will say the inverse. The movie is fun, heroic and has a lot of characters developmente, plus action.",1
528,A shallow depiction of a fun and entertaining super-hero team movie with a cast that desperately attempts to save the tone of the movie.,0
529,I don’t care what anyone says this movie is great and every hero had his shining moment,1
533,"I don't really know what people saw. I just saw a good movie with good likable characters, and fights. It has it's lows... but come on, it's a really good movie to watch and enjoy. Really liked the vibe i got from this, everything seems on point, i wish it was Green Lantern, where is he? Also Stepphenwolf needed to give more fight than just that. But it's really enjoyable i really think the characters can grow by themselves and as a group.",1
534,It isn't really BAD movie. It's good movie but it's justice leage. One of most Historical and Honoured Hero group of History. I'm not DC fan but I like this movie. Also Flash was prefect and another actor were good.,1
535,"Justice League's pacing was a bit slow in the beginning but other than that and a few other minor complaints I have, all and all I really enjoyed this movie. Great character interactions and dialog.",1
539,"From the first moment of Superman till the very end scene Lex luthor this is a true comic book movie adaption. True there are few CGI errors, but ""Nothing is perfect in this world"" and this is just a movie.",1
540,I loved the justice league film. Looking past some of the dated cgi. I found the movie to be extremely entertaining. People were looking for a plot to the movie but i felt that the plot was to bring the justice league together. If you want full stories of the characters wait for there solo movies. Unlike marvel in which gave many character movies prior to the avengers movie I see it as BvS was a prequel to justice league and that from here the movies branch out to solo movies and connecting back to Justice league 2. It is a different strategy and if people give it a chance they will see it as well.The movie was no where near bad and critics make it out to be. Again i loved this movie and cannot wait for the next DCEU film.,1
541,"There is some bad cut senses but it is still the best movie for me. Flash and Aquaman make it well. The smile of WW make me happy, :D. I love watching Justice League at all.Well done.",1
542,"This is the best movie of 2017 so far for me. The acting was awesome, the action scenes were epic and the screenplay is beyond expectations. JUSTICE LEAGUE.",1
543,"This movie is just awesome!!! It's fun, dramatic and much more. Aquaman and Flash are great, WW is so Badass and Batman, is the Batman. I laughed a lot... Really recommended!",1
544,"It's not a perfect movie, but it was fun, entertaining and to be frank made me wish for more to come. (Spoiler)Really good Superman portrail, he is a suposed to be a beakon of hope, a boyscout, this movie delivered that.(End of Spoiler)",1
546,"The harsh reviews about this movie are misleading. The chemistry between the characters are great, the performance is spot on, and they adhere to the source material, which the true fans will appreciate. But more than that, I went to see this movie who knows nothing about the justice league and she really enjoyed it. It accomplish setting up the new characters and establishing a time line and a fresh start for the known one. There are no dull moments or fillers. My only reservation about the movie is the CGI, which is poorly done, especially the mustache fiasco. Given the ground that this movie had to cover and the limited time that it had to tell the story I think it was very well done. Go see it and draw your own conclusion, instead of listening to the bad press, I am sure you will enjoy it.",1
547,"Very good movie when it comes to the team assembling and fighting its first big threat. Almost every character knocks it out of the park. I thought Cyborg would be the wet blanket, but even he is fine. Steppenwolf was a serviceable villain who came off as powerful enough to match the league in strength. The story was mostly logical and there weren't cringy Luthor moments or plotholes. Entertaining action scenes and good character beats + some jokes. Recommending this, not worse than Avengers really, only thing is it may have been a bit too short @ 1:58",1
548,"The movie dosen't take chances with the plot, and it can best be described as a ""safe"" movie after the rough road WB/DC superhero movies have had since Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. That said Justice League is still an enjoyable movie.",1
549,"Despite its flaws, Justice League is an overall great movie.  The main issues are its visual effects and lack of some important exposition, but those failings are made up for by the performances, action, humor, and flashiness of it all.I honestly don't know what movies the majority of critics saw, but it certainly couldn't have been this one.  I do believe the film would have been better without the extensive cuts and reshoots, but I digress.  What we got was a perfectly respectable comic book movie, one that I am more than happy to go see again a couple more times.",1
550,"Muy buena película, muy entretenida, de lo mejor de DC, y la mejor de superhéroes de este año, la única pega es Cyborg, no tiene carisma, y tal vez se abusa un poco del CGI.",1
551,Exciting and full of action. I enjoy every minute of it and it's another good choice of heroes movies. It's really good and it leaves me surprised that the criticism was so hard on her.,1
553,"Epic film. Much better then then the Avengers. Cast was excellent and the visual effects were awesome. Steppenwolf was awesome as well, but now it is time for the Justice League to face Darkseid. Best DCEU movie in my opinion.",1
554,"Good movie, simple, direct, closed in its purposes, good interaction between characters, good cast, cool post credits scenes... don`t know wy critics are giving a hard time for this movie!",1
555,"Action scenes were awesome,Humor was funny, Wonder Woman was so fun to watch, Aquaman was awesome and also funny,chemistry was good and great portrayals also I give this an A grade.",1
557,Worst superhero movie since Greenlantern. Both story and art direction was way of rails and whole movie didn't make sense at all. Cyborg looks like some lowbudget fanfilm vfx monster.,0
560,I enjoyed it. Some good scenes like when Superman takes on the Justice league..,1
562,"I thought Justice League pretty enjoyable. Everyone's performances are really good, and the dynamic between the characters are fun to watch. But, there are a few problems. For one, the CGI is pretty weak. Some shots look like they'd be great video game effects, but they don't look convincing in real life.Also, I feel like Justice League was trying to ""fix"" the issues than angry fanboys had. But, however, the things they were ""fixing"" were things that didn't even need fixing. For one, the tone felt VERY different from the other DCEU movies. But unlike the X-Men movies or the MCU, the tonal shift feels very abrupt. We went from a more aggressive franchise with little bits of humor to being more kid-friendly. Again, I don't mind if they want to go a little lighter, but it's pretty clear that some of the choices to make it lighter were not part of the original vision.Another example is the color. It might be brighter, but you can tell that from the way it was shot, you can tell this color pallette was not the original style for the film. It gives the film a more washed-out look.Also, the music is pretty disappointing. What Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL did in Man of Steel and Batman v Superman was incredible. The music in those films were both fun to listen to, yet aggressive enough to be intense. Danny Elfman's score feels very out of place, even adding some unneeded callbacks to the '89 Batman theme and the '78 Superman theme.But, even though I wish the studio didn't feel pressured to make it more kid-friendly instead of just sticking to the tone and style they had with the previous 4 films in the franchise, Justice League is a decent film with nice character interactions.And no, there's no Snyder Cut. Give it a rest.",1
566,"I think this film would probably get a lot more hate if ANYBODY even had the energy to care about it at this point. What should have been the shining moment in DC's movie universe instead just turned out a fat nothing. Sure, a couple of the scenes were cool (Superman's revival was awesome, even if a bit dumb), but overall the plot was boring, the villain was boring, the quips were more annoying than endearing, and the whole thing didn't even have the visuals to back it up. Walking the line between poorly executed and straight-up bad.Watched May 3rd 2018",0
568,"Alright, this may be my favorite DCEU movie so far (Wonder Woman might be its only contender). It’s introduction and suddenness of its villain was pretty dumb, as if DC was running out of ideas, and there was a LOT of CGI animation. This film makes up for that though by adding great action scenes and humor and throwing in some new characters that are witty and clever (Flash, you’re awesome!). I had a great time watching this film and loved the surprise ending! Pumped for Part 2!",1
569,"Justice league was an awesome movie. I thought about giving it an 8 or 7 but, then I realized Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot and the rest of the crew were pretty spot on with regards to their performances. Albeit the movie has it's many flaws,notably the CGI and thin plot, overall it's a pretty darn good movie that I would personally recommend to anyone who wants to have a good time watching the best of dc.",1
573,"It is flawed, but the movie is overall very enjoyable. Flash and Aquaman are the standout characters, whereas Steppenwolf feels very similar to Malekith from Thor: The Dark World, very generic villain/",1
576,"One of the better DC movies. I really like wonder women, batman and aquaman. They bring humor to DC, which is great. DC still has some ways to go with the backstories of its characters, which at the moment suck. I'm curious to see how DC will manage in the future after this movie.",1
578,"Justice League was a step in the right direction for the DCEU. After wonder woman taught us it was okay to have joy in a DC movie Justice League followed suite and gave us an optimistic fun superhero movie. Sure haters will scream from the depths of the sweaty underbelly of ICP crazed fandom, ""release the Snyder Cut!!!!!!"" but they don't need to, it was FINE!",1
580,"The length is so fitting on the storytelling, what else does everyone need? I know that the trailer had so many scenes that we wanted to see, but for me, the movie and its duration are perfect!The performances were amazing, especially Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman!And the story was great, but not lie BvS, my favorite DCEU movie actually, but still, it has a great story though!The CGI of Steppenwolf was great too, Steppenwolf as a character was threatening and violent, and that's a thing I wanted to see actually! The CGI in general was great and stunning!A Justice League movie that every DC fan deserves in my opinion.",1
582,"ESTE FILM ME GUSTO, SI ES VERDAD, LE FALTO LINTERNA VERDE O MARTIAN MANHUNTER, NO ME GUSTA DANNY ELFMAN EN LA BANDA SONORA. QUIZÁS MAS MÚSICA TRANCE O ROCK ELECTRONICO, PERO ME GUSTO', SE PUEDE VER!!!!",1
583,"While this movie wasn't perfect, it's not bad. It suffered from the fact that it was part of the DC universe and thus over criticised. The cast were great most of the CGI was good. The story and direction were obviously reworked, which reduced the films potential from the beginning.",1

594,"I think hardcore DC comic fans will appreciate the movie more than the general audience will. Being a DC fan, I enjoyed it a bit more because of the references from the comic books that it made.",1
595,"A good movie with all your favorite characters. Pretty entertaining, but it won't match up to the meticulous world-building of the MCU. Still, a pretty decent movie.",1
596,"The biggest flaw of the film was that it didn’t fully utilized its characters. They just jumbled up some of the members of the Justice League from the comics, gave it a substandard representation of a villain, and called it a day.",1
600,"Decent movie. A bad thing about this album is that its corny, especially Batmans one liners. Its decent overall 6.5",1
602,"I adore this movie, it has hope,action and the characters actually act like the characters from the comics/animated series (JLU) . It showed me that even if you seem strong on the outside we all still need people to be even stronger.#Hope",1
604,"The bright and colorful action and the lighthearted tone reveal the lovely effect that Diana Prince has made upon DC. We have gotten so saturated with comic book films up to this point that we needed one that was kinda fluffy to appreciate which is exactly what we were given from this film that would have been doomed without Wonder Woman who lassoed DC into the light and out of the grasp of The Dark Knight that was consuming DC in darkness. There will always be this fight between the dark and the light, but I believe that no matter how many other inspirations of The Dark Knight will follow. They will not defeat the outstanding influence that Wonder Woman has made upon DC.",1
